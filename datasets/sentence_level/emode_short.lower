from fairest creatures we desire increase.
that thereby beauty’s rose might never die.
but as the riper should by time decease.
his tender heir might bear his memory.
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes.
feedest thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel.
making a famine where abundance lies.
thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament.
and only herald to the gaudy spring.
within thine own bud buriest thy content.
and, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
pity the world, or else this glutton be.
to eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow.
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field.
thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now.
will be a tattered weed of small worth held.
then being asked, where all thy beauty lies.
where all the treasure of thy lusty days.
to say, within thine own deep sunken eyes.
were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
how much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use.
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count, and make my old excuse.
proving his beauty by succession thine.
this were to be new made when thou art old.
and see thy blood warm when thou feelest it cold.
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest.
now is the time that face should form another.
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest.
thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ?
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self-love to stop posterity ?
thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime.
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see.
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
but if thou live remembered not to be.
die single and thine image dies with thee.
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend.
upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy ?
nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend.
and being frank she lends to those are free.
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse.
the bounteous largess given thee to give ?
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live ?
for having traffic with thyself alone.
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
then how when nature calls thee to be gone.
what acceptable audit canst thou leave ?
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee.
which used lives the executor to be.
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same.
and that unfair which fairly doth excel.
for never-resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there.
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone.
beauty over-snowed and bareness every where.
then were not summer’s distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass.
beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft.
nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet.
leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
then let not winter’s ragged hand deface.
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled.
make sweet some vial, treasure thou some place.
with beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed.
that use is not forbidden usury.
which happies those that pay the willing loan.
that’s for thyself to breed another thee.
or ten times happier be it ten for one.
ten times thyself were happier than thou art.
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee.
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart.
leaving thee living in posterity ?
be not self-willed for thou art much too fair.
to be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head, each under eye
doth homage to his new-appearing sight.
serving with looks his sacred majesty.
and having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill.
resembling strong youth in his middle age.
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still.
attending on his golden pilgrimage.
but when from highmost pitch with weary car.
like feeble age he reeleth from the day.
the eyes ( fore duteous ) now converted are
from his low tract and look another way.
so thou, thyself out-going in thy noon.
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
music to hear, why hearest thou music sadly ?
sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly.
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy ?
if the true concord of well-tuned sounds.
by unions married do offend thine ear.
they do but sweetly chide thee.
who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
mark how one string sweet husband to another.
strikes each in each by mutual ordering.
resembling sire, and child, and happy mother.
who all in one, one pleasing note do sing.
whose speechless song being many, seeming one.
sings this to thee, thou single wilt prove none.
is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye.
that thou consumest thyself in single life ?
ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife.
the world will be thy widow and still weep.
that thou no form of thee hast left behind.
when every private widow well may keep.
by children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind.
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it.
but beauty’s waste hath in the world an end.
and kept unused the user so destroys it.
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murderous shame commits.
for shame deny that thou bearest love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident.
grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many.
but that thou none lovest is most evident.
for thou art so possessed with murderous hate.
that against thyself thou stickest not to conspire.
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire.
o change thy thought, that i may change my mind.
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love ?
be as thy presence is gracious and kind.
or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.
make thee another self for love of me.
that beauty still may live in thine or thee.
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest.
in one of thine, from that which thou departest.
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest.
thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest.
herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase.
without this folly, age, and cold decay.
if all were minded so, the times should cease.
and threescore year would make the world away.
let those whom nature hath not made for store.
harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish.
look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more.
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.
she carved thee for her seal.
and meant thereby.
thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
when i do count the clock that tells the time.
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night.
when i behold the violet past prime.
and sable curls all silvered over with white.
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves.
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer’s green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard.
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go.
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake.
and die as fast as they see others grow.
and nothing against time’s scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
o that you were your self, but love you are
no longer yours, than you yourself here live.
against this coming end you should prepare.
and your sweet semblance to some other give.
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination, then you were
yourself again after yourself’s decease.
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
who lets so fair a house fall to decay.
which husbandry in honour might uphold.
against the stormy gusts of winter’s day
and barren rage of death’s eternal cold ?
o none but unthrifts, dear my love you know.
you had a father, let your son say so.
not from the stars do i my judgement pluck.
and yet methinks i have astronomy.
but not to tell of good, or evil luck.
of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality.
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell.
pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind.
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find.
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive.
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert.
or else of thee this i prognosticate.
thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.
when i consider everything that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment.
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
when i perceive that men as plants increase.
cheered and checked even by the self-same sky.
vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease.
and wear their brave state out of memory.
then the conceit of this inconstant stay.
sets you most rich in youth before my sight.
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night.
and all in war with time for love of you.
as he takes from you, i engraft you new.
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time ?
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
now stand you on the top of happy hours.
and many maiden gardens yet unset.
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers.
much liker than your painted counterfeit.
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this ( time’s pencil ) or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
to give away yourself, keeps yourself still.
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts ?
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
if i could write the beauty of your eyes.
and in fresh numbers number all your graces.
the age to come would say this poet lies.
such heavenly touches never touched earthly faces.
so should my papers ( yellowed with their age )
be scorned.
like old men of less truth than tongue.
and your true rights be termed a poet’s rage.
and stretched metre of an antique song.
but were some child of yours alive that time.
you should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme.
shall i compare thee to a summer’s day ?
thou art more lovely and more temperate.
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may.
and summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines.
and often is his gold complexion dimmed.
and every fair from fair sometime declines.
by chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed.
but thy eternal summer shall not fade.
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest.
nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade.
when in eternal lines to time thou growest.
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see.
so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
devouring time blunt thou the lion’s paws.
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood.
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws.
and burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood.
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetest.
and do whatever thou wilt swift-footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets.
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime.
o carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow.
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen.
him in thy course untainted do allow.
for beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.
yet do thy worst, old time, despite thy wrong.
my love shall in my verse ever live young.
a woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted.
hast thou the master mistress of my passion.
a woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women’s fashion.
an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling.
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth.
a man in hue all hues in his controlling.
which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
and for a woman wert thou first created.
till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting.
and by addition me of thee defeated.
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
but since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure.
mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.
so is it not with me as with that muse.
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse.
who heaven it self for ornament doth use.
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse.
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems.
with april’s first-born flowers and all things rare.
that heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.
o let me true in love but truly write.
and then believe me, my love is as fair.
as any mother’s child, though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air.
let them say more that like of hearsay well.
i will not praise that purpose not to sell.
my glass shall not persuade me i am old.
so long as youth and thou are of one date.
but when in thee time’s furrows i behold.
then look i death my days should expiate.
for all that beauty that doth cover thee.
is but the seemly raiment of my heart.
which in thy breast doth live.
as thine in me.
how can i then be elder than thou art ?
o therefore love be of thyself so wary.
as i not for my self, but for thee will.
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain.
thou gavest me thine not to give back again.
as an unperfect actor on the stage.
who with his fear is put beside his part.
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage.
whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart.
so i for fear of trust, forget to say.
the perfect ceremony of love’s rite.
and in mine own love’s strength seem to decay.
overcharged with burthen of mine own love’s might.
o let my looks be then the eloquence.
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast.
who plead for love.
and look for recompense.
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
o learn to read what silent love hath writ.
to hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.
mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled.
thy beauty’s form in table of my heart.
my body is the frame wherein ’tis held.
and perspective it is best painter’s art.
for through the painter must you see his skill.
to find where your true image pictured lies.
which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still.
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done.
mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art.
they draw but what they see, know not the heart.
let those who are in favour with their stars.
of public honour and proud titles boast.
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most.
great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread.
but as the marigold at the sun’s eye.
and in themselves their pride lies buried.
for at a frown they in their glory die.
the painful warrior famoused for fight.
after a thousand victories once foiled.
is from the book of honour razed quite.
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled.
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed.
lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit.
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty, not to show my wit.
duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it.
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul’s thought ( all naked ) will bestow it.
till whatsoever star that guides my moving.
points on me graciously with fair aspect.
and puts apparel on my tattered loving.
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect.
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee.
till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
weary with toil, i haste me to my bed.
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired.
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.
for then my thoughts.
from far where i abide.
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee.
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide.
looking on darkness which the blind do see.
save that my soul’s imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view.
which like a jewel ( hung in ghastly night )
makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind.
for thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarred the benefit of rest ?
when day’s oppression is not eased by night.
but day by night and night by day oppressed.
and each ( though enemies to either’s reign )
do in consent shake hands to torture me.
the one by toil, the other to complain
how far i toil, still farther off from thee.
i tell the day to please him thou art bright.
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven.
so flatter i the swart-complexioned night.
when sparkling stars twire not thou gildest the even.
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer.
and night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger
when in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes.
i all alone beweep my outcast state.
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries.
and look upon my self and curse my fate.
wishing me like to one more rich in hope.
featured like him, like him with friends possessed.
desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope.
with what i most enjoy contented least.
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising.
haply i think on thee.
and then my state.
( like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth ) sings hymns at heaven’s gate.
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings.
that then i scorn to change my state with kings.
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought.
i summon up remembrance of things past.
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought.
and with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste.
then can i drown an eye ( unused to flow )
for precious friends hid in death’s dateless night.
and weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe.
and moan the expense of many a vanished sight.
then can i grieve at grievances foregone.
and heavily from woe to woe tell over
the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan.
which i new pay as if not paid before.
but if the while i think on thee ( dear friend )
all losses are restored, and sorrows end.
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts.
which i by lacking have supposed dead.
and there reigns love and all love’s loving parts.
and all those friends which i thought buried.
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stolen from mine eye.
as interest of the dead, which now appear.
but things removed that hidden in thee lie.
thou art the grave where buried love doth live.
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone.
who all their parts of me to thee did give.
that due of many, now is thine alone.
their images i loved, i view in thee.
and thou, all they, hast all the all of me.
if thou survive my well-contented day.
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re-survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover.
compare them with the bett’ring of the time.
and though they be outstripped by every pen.
reserve them for my love.
not for their rhyme.
exceeded by the height of happier men.
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought.
had my friend’s muse grown with this growing age.
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage.
but since he died and poets better prove.
theirs for their style i’ll read.
his for his love’.
full many a glorious morning have i seen.
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye.
kissing with golden face the meadows green.
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.
anon permit the basest clouds to ride.
with ugly rack on his celestial face.
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.
even so my sun one early morn did shine.
with all triumphant splendour on my brow.
but out alack, he was but one hour mine.
the region cloud hath masked him from me now.
yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth.
suns of the world may stain.
when heaven’s sun staineth.
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day.
and make me travel forth without my cloak.
to let base clouds overtake me in my way.
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ?
’tis not enough that through the cloud thou break.
to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face.
for no man well of such a salve can speak.
that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace.
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief.
though thou repent, yet i have still the loss.
the offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence’s cross.
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds.
and they are rich.
and ransom all ill deeds.
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
roses have thorns.
and silver fountains mud.
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun.
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
all men make faults.
and even i in this.
authorizing thy trespass with compare.
my self corrupting salving thy amiss.
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are.
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense.
thy adverse party is thy advocate.
and against my self a lawful plea commence.
such civil war is in my love and hate.
that i an accessary needs must be.
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
let me confess that we two must be twain.
although our undivided loves are one.
so shall those blots that do with me remain.
without thy help.
by me be borne alone.
in our two loves there is but one respect.
though in our lives a separable spite.
which though it alter not love’s sole effect.
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.
i may not evermore acknowledge thee.
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame.
nor thou with public kindness honour me.
unless thou take that honour from thy name.
but do not so, i love thee in such sort.
as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
as a decrepit father takes delight.
to see his active child do deeds of youth.
so i, made lame by fortune’s dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit.
or any of these all, or all, or more
entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit.
i make my love engrafted to this store.
so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised.
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give.
that i in thy abundance am sufficed.
and by a part of all thy glory live.
look what is best, that best i wish in thee.
this wish i have, then ten times happy me.
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pourest into my verse.
thine own sweet argument, too excellent.
for every vulgar paper to rehearse ?
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me.
worthy perusal stand against thy sight.
for who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee.
when thou thyself dost give invention light ?
be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate.
and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date.
if my slight muse do please these curious days.
the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
o how thy worth with manners may i sing.
when thou art all the better part of me ?
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring.
and what is’t but mine own when i praise thee ?
even for this, let us divided live.
and our dear love lose name of single one.
that by this separation i may give.
that due to thee which thou deservest alone.
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove.
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave.
to entertain the time with thoughts of love.
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.
and that thou teachest how to make one twain.
by praising him here who doth hence remain.
take all my loves, my love, yea take them all.
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?
no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call.
all mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
then if for my love, thou my love receivest.
i cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest.
but yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty.
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury.
lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows.
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits.
when i am sometime absent from thy heart.
thy beauty, and thy years full well befits.
for still temptation follows where thou art.
gentle thou art, and therefore to be won.
beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
and when a woman woos, what woman’s son.
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ?
ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear.
and chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth.
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth.
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee.
thine by thy beauty being false to me.
that thou hast her it is not all my grief.
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly.
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief.
a loss in love that touches me more nearly.
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye.
thou dost love her, because thou knowest i love her.
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me.
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
if i lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain.
and losing her, my friend hath found that loss.
both find each other, and i lose both twain.
and both for my sake lay on me this cross.
but here’s the joy, my friend and i are one.
sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see.
for all the day they view things unrespected.
but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee.
and darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow’s form, form happy show.
to the clear day with thy much clearer light.
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so !
how would ( i say ) mine eyes be blessed made.
by looking on thee in the living day.
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade.
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay !
all days are nights to see till i see thee.
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought.
injurious distance should not stop my way.
for then despite of space i would be brought.
from limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee.
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land.
as soon as think the place where he would be.
but ah, thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone.
but that so much of earth and water wrought.
i must attend, time’s leisure with my moan.
receiving nought by elements so slow.
but heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.
the other two, slight air, and purging fire.
are both with thee, wherever i abide.
the first my thought, the other my desire.
these present-absent with swift motion slide.
for when these quicker elements are gone.
in tender embassy of love to thee.
my life being made of four, with two alone.
sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
until life’s composition be recured.
by those swift messengers returned from thee.
who even but now come back again assured.
of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
this told, i joy, but then no longer glad.
i send them back again and straight grow sad.
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war.
how to divide the conquest of thy sight.
mine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar.
my heart, mine eye the freedom of that right.
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie.
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes.
but the defendant doth that plea deny.
and says in him thy fair appearance lies.
to side this title is impanelled.
a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart.
and by their verdict is determined.
the clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.
as thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part.
and my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took.
and each doth good turns now unto the other.
when that mine eye is famished for a look.
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother.
with my love’s picture then my eye doth feast.
and to the painted banquet bids my heart.
another time mine eye is my heart’s guest.
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
so either by thy picture or my love.
thyself away, art present still with me.
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move.
and i am still with them, and they with thee.
or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight.
how careful was i when i took my way.
each trifle under truest bars to thrust.
that to my use it might unused stay.
from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust !
but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are.
most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief.
thou best of dearest, and mine only care.
art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
thee have i not locked up in any chest.
save where thou art not, though i feel thou art.
within the gentle closure of my breast.
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part.
and even thence thou wilt be stolen i fear.
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
against that time ( if ever that time come )
when i shall see thee frown on my defects.
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum.
called to that audit by advised respects.
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass.
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye.
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity.
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert.
and this my hand, against my self uprear.
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part.
to leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws.
since why to love, i can allege no cause.
how heavy do i journey on the way.
when what i seek ( my weary travel’s end )
doth teach that case and that repose to say.
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.
the beast that bears me, tired with my woe.
plods dully on, to bear that weight in me.
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee.
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on.
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide.
which heavily he answers with a groan.
more sharp to me than spurring to his side.
for that same groan doth put this in my mind.
my grief lies onward and my joy behind.
thus can my love excuse the slow offence.
of my dull bearer, when from thee i speed.
from where thou art, why should i haste me thence ?
till i return of posting is no need.
o what excuse will my poor beast then find.
when swift extremity can seem but slow ?
then should i spur though mounted on the wind.
in winged speed no motion shall i know.
then can no horse with my desire keep pace.
therefore desire ( of perfectest love being made )
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race.
but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade.
since from thee going, he went wilful-slow.
towards thee i’ll run, and give him leave to go.
so am i as the rich whose blessed key.
can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure.
the which he will not every hour survey.
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare.
since seldom coming in that long year set.
like stones of worth they thinly placed are.
or captain jewels in the carcanet.
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide.
to make some special instant special-blest.
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope.
being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
what is your substance, whereof are you made.
that millions of strange shadows on you tend ?
since every one, hath every one, one shade.
and you but one, can every shadow lend.
describe adonis and the counterfeit.
is poorly imitated after you.
on helen’s cheek all art of beauty set.
and you in grecian tires are painted new.
speak of the spring, and foison of the year.
the one doth shadow of your beauty show.
the other as your bounty doth appear.
and you in every blessed shape we know.
in all external grace you have some part.
but you like none, none you for constant heart.
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem.
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give !
the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem.
for that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye.
as the perfumed tincture of the roses.
hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly.
when summer’s breath their masked buds discloses.
but for their virtue only is their show.
they live unwooed, and unrespected fade.
die to themselves, sweet roses do not so.
of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made.
and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth.
when that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.
not marble, nor the gilded monuments.
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme.
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
when wasteful war shall statues overturn.
and broils root out the work of masonry.
nor mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn.
the living record of your memory.
against death, and all-oblivious enmity.
shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room.
even in the eyes of all posterity.
that wear this world out to the ending doom.
so till the judgment that yourself arise.
you live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.
sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite.
which but today by feeding is allayed.
tomorrow sharpened in his former might.
so love be thou, although today thou fill
thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness.
tomorrow see again, and do not kill.
the spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore, where two contracted new.
come daily to the banks, that when they see.
return of love, more blest may be the view.
or call it winter, which being full of care.
makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
being your slave what should i do but tend.
upon the hours, and times of your desire ?
i have no precious time at all to spend.
nor services to do till you require.
nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour.
whilst i ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you.
nor think the bitterness of absence sour.
when you have bid your servant once adieu.
nor dare i question with my jealous thought.
where you may be, or your affairs suppose.
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are, how happy you make those.
so true a fool is love, that in your will.
( though you do any thing ) he thinks no ill.
that god forbid, that made me first your slave.
i should in thought control your times of pleasure.
or at your hand the account of hours to crave.
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
o let me suffer ( being at your beck )
the imprisoned absence of your liberty.
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check.
without accusing you of injury.
be where you list, your charter is so strong.
that you yourself may privilage your time
to what you will, to you it doth belong.
yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
i am to wait, though waiting so be hell.
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
if there be nothing new, but that which is.
hath been before, how are our brains beguiled.
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burthen of a former child !
o that record could with a backward look.
even of five hundred courses of the sun.
show me your image in some antique book.
since mind at first in character was done.
that i might see what the old world could say.
to this composed wonder of your frame.
whether we are mended, or whether better they.
or whether revolution be the same.
o sure i am the wits of former days.
to subjects worse have given admiring praise.
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore.
so do our minutes hasten to their end.
each changing place with that which goes before.
in sequent toil all forwards do contend.
nativity once in the main of light.
crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned.
crooked eclipses against his glory fight.
and time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth.
and delves the parallels in beauty’s brow.
feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth.
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
and yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
is it thy will, thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night ?
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken.
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?
is it thy spirit that thou sendest from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry.
to find out shames and idle hours in me.
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy ?
o no, thy love though much, is not so great.
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake.
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat.
to play the watchman ever for thy sake.
for thee watch i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere.
from me far off, with others all too near.
sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye.
and all my soul, and all my every part.
and for this sin there is no remedy.
it is so grounded inward in my heart.
methinks no face so gracious is as mine.
no shape so true, no truth of such account.
and for my self mine own worth do define.
as i all other in all worths surmount.
but when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity.
mine own self-love quite contrary i read.
self, so self-loving were iniquity.
’tis thee, myself, that for myself i praise.
painting my age with beauty of thy days.
against my love shall be as i am now
with time’s injurious hand crushed and overworn.
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to age’s steepy night.
and all those beauties whereof now he’s king
are vanishing, or vanished out of sight.
stealing away the treasure of his spring.
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age’s cruel knife.
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life.
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen.
and they shall live, and he in them still green.
when i have seen by time’s fell hand defaced
the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age.
when sometime lofty towers i see down-rased.
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore.
and the firm soil win of the watery main.
increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
when i have seen such interchange of state.
or state it self confounded, to decay.
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate.
that time will come and take my love away.
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea.
but sad mortality oversways their power.
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea.
whose action is no stronger than a flower ?
o how shall summer’s honey breath hold out.
against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days.
when rocks impregnable are not so stout.
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays ?
o fearful meditation, where alack.
shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid ?
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back.
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?
o none, unless this miracle have might.
that in black ink my love may still shine bright.
tired with all these, for restful death i cry.
as to behold desert a beggar born.
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity.
and purest faith unhappily forsworn.
and gilded honour shamefully misplaced.
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted.
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced.
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue-tied by authority.
and folly, doctor-like, controlling skill.
and simple truth miscalled simplicity.
and captive good attending captain ill.
tired with all these, from these would i be gone.
save that to die, i leave my love alone.
ah wherefore with infection should he live.
and with his presence grace impiety.
that sin by him advantage should achieve.
and lace it self with his society ?
why should false painting imitate his cheek.
and steal dead seeming of his living hue ?
why should poor beauty indirectly seek.
roses of shadow, since his rose is true ?
why should he live, now nature bankrupt is.
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins.
for she hath no exchequer now but his.
and proud of many, lives upon his gains ?
o him she stores, to show what wealth she had.
in days long since, before these last so bad.
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn.
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now.
before these bastard signs of fair were born.
or durst inhabit on a living brow.
before the golden tresses of the dead.
the right of sepulchres, were shorn away.
to live a second life on second head.
ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay.
in him those holy antique hours are seen.
without all ornament, it self and true.
making no summer of another’s green.
robbing no old to dress his beauty new.
and him as for a map doth nature store.
to show false art what beauty was of yore.
those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view.
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend.
all tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due.
uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned.
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own.
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
they look into the beauty of thy mind.
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds.
then churls their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind )
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds.
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show.
the soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect.
for slander’s mark was ever yet the fair.
the ornament of beauty is suspect.
a crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.
so thou be good, slander doth but approve.
thy worth the greater being wooed of time.
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love.
and thou presentest a pure unstained prime.
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days.
either not assailed, or victor being charged.
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise.
to tie up envy, evermore enlarged.
if some suspect of ill masked not thy show.
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
no longer mourn for me when i am dead.
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell.
nay if you read this line, remember not.
the hand that writ it, for i love you so.
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot.
if thinking on me then should make you woe.
o if, i say, you look upon this verse.
when i ( perhaps ) compounded am with clay.
do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
but let your love even with my life decay.
lest the wise world should look into your moan.
and mock you with me after i am gone.
o lest the world should task you to recite.
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death, dear love, forget me quite.
for you in me can nothing worthy prove.
unless you would devise some virtuous lie.
to do more for me than mine own desert.
and hang more praise upon deceased i.
than niggard truth would willingly impart.
o lest your true love may seem false in this.
that you for love speak well of me untrue.
my name be buried where my body is.
and live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth.
and so should you, to love things nothing worth.
that time of year thou mayst in me behold.
when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold.
bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
in me thou seest the twilight of such day.
as after sunset fadeth in the west.
which by and by black night doth take away.
death’s second self that seals up all in rest.
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire.
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie.
as the death-bed, whereon it must expire.
consumed with that which it was nourished by.
this thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong.
to love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
but be contented when that fell arrest.
without all bail shall carry me away.
my life hath in this line some interest.
which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
when thou reviewest this, thou dost review.
the very part was consecrate to thee.
the earth can have but earth, which is his due.
my spirit is thine the better part of me.
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life.
the prey of worms, my body being dead.
the coward conquest of a wretch’s knife.
too base of thee to be remembered.
the worth of that, is that which it contains.
and that is this, and this with thee remains.
so are you to my thoughts as food to life.
or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground.
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure.
now counting best to be with you alone.
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure.
sometime all full with feasting on your sight.
and by and by clean starved for a look.
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had, or must from you be took.
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day.
or gluttoning on all, or all away.
why is my verse so barren of new pride ?
so far from variation or quick change ?
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new-found methods, and to compounds strange ?
why write i still all one, ever the same.
and keep invention in a noted weed.
that every word doth almost tell my name.
showing their birth, and where they did proceed ?
o know sweet love i always write of you.
and you and love are still my argument.
so all my best is dressing old words new.
spending again what is already spent.
for as the sun is daily new and old.
so is my love still telling what is told.
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear.
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste.
these vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear.
and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show.
of mouthed graves will give thee memory.
thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know.
time’s thievish progress to eternity.
look what thy memory cannot contain.
commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
those children nursed, delivered from thy brain.
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
these offices, so oft as thou wilt look.
shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse.
and found such fair assistance in my verse.
as every alien pen hath got my use.
and under thee their poesy disperse.
thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing.
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly.
have added feathers to the learned’s wing.
and given grace a double majesty.
yet be most proud of that which i compile.
whose influence is thine, and born of thee.
in others’ works thou dost but mend the style.
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
but thou art all my art, and dost advance
as high as learning, my rude ignorance.
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid.
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace.
but now my gracious numbers are decayed.
and my sick muse doth give an other place.
i grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen.
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent.
he robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word.
from thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek.
he can afford
no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
then thank him not for that which he doth say.
since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.
o how i faint when i of you do write.
knowing a better spirit doth use your name.
and in the praise thereof spends all his might.
to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
but since your wort, wide as the ocean is.
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear.
my saucy bark ( inferior far to his )
on your broad main doth wilfully appear.
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat.
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride.
or ( being wrecked ) i am a worthless boat.
he of tall building, and of goodly pride.
then if he thrive and i be cast away.
the worst was this.
my love was my decay.
or i shall live your epitaph to make.
or you survive when i in earth am rotten.
from hence your memory death cannot take.
although in me each part will be forgotten.
your name from hence immortal life shall have.
though i ( once gone ) to all the world must die.
the earth can yield me but a common grave.
when you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.
your monument shall be my gentle verse.
which eyes not yet created shall over-read.
and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse.
when all the breathers of this world are dead.
you still shall live, such virtue hath my pen.
where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
i grant thou wert not married to my muse.
and therefore mayst without attaint overlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject, blessing every book.
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue.
finding thy worth a limit past my praise.
and therefore art enforced to seek anew.
some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
and do so love, yet when they have devised.
what strained touches rhetoric can lend.
thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized.
in true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
and their gross painting might be better used.
where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
i never saw that you did painting need.
and therefore to your fair no painting set.
i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed.
that barren tender of a poet’s debt.
and therefore have i slept in your report.
that you yourself being extant well might show.
how far a modern quill doth come too short.
speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
this silence for my sin you did impute.
which shall be most my glory being dumb.
for i impair not beauty being mute.
when others would give life, and bring a tomb.
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes.
than both your poets can in praise devise.
who is it that says most, which can say more.
than this rich praise.
that you alone are you.
in whose confine immured is the store.
which should example where your equal grew.
lean penury within that pen doth dwell.
that to his subject lends not some small glory.
but he that writes of you, if he can tell.
that you are you, so dignifies his story.
let him but copy what in you is writ.
not making worse what nature made so clear.
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit.
making his style admired every where.
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse.
being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still.
while comments of your praise richly compiled.
reserve their character with golden quill.
and precious phrase by all the muses filed.
i think good thoughts, whilst other write good words.
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen.
to every hymn that able spirit affords.
in polished form of well refined pen.
hearing you praised, i say ’tis so, ’tis true.
and to the most of praise add something more.
but that is in my thought, whose love to you
( though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before.
then others, for the breath of words respect.
me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
was it the proud full sail of his great verse.
bound for the prize of ( all too precious ) you.
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse.
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?
was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write.
above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead ?
no, neither he, nor his compeers by night
giving him aid, my verse astonished.
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence.
as victors of my silence cannot boast.
i was not sick of any fear from thence.
but when your countenance filled up his line.
then lacked i matter, that enfeebled mine.
farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing.
and like enough thou knowest thy estimate.
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing.
my bonds in thee are all determinate.
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting.
and for that riches where is my deserving ?
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting.
and so my patent back again is swerving.
thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing.
or me to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking.
so thy great gift upon misprision growing.
comes home again, on better judgement making.
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter.
in sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light.
and place my merit in the eye of scorn.
upon thy side, against my self i’ll fight.
and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
with mine own weakness being best acquainted.
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed, wherein i am attainted.
that thou in losing me, shalt win much glory.
and i by this will be a gainer too.
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee.
the injuries that to my self i do.
doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
such is my love, to thee i so belong.
that for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault.
and i will comment upon that offence.
speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt.
against thy reasons making no defence.
thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill.
to set a form upon desired change.
as i’ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will.
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange.
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue.
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell.
lest i, too much profane, should do it wrong.
and haply of our old acquaintance tell.
for thee, against my self i’ll vow debate.
for i must never love him whom thou dost hate.
then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now.
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross.
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow.
and do not drop in for an after-loss.
ah do not, when my heart hath escaped this sorrow.
come in the rearward of a conquered woe.
give not a windy night a rainy morrow.
to linger out a purposed overthrow.
if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last.
when other petty griefs have done their spite.
but in the onset come, so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune’s might.
and other strains of woe, which now seem woe.
compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
some glory in their birth, some in their skill.
some in their wealth, some in their body’s force.
some in their garments though new-fangled ill.
some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure.
wherein it finds a joy above the rest.
but these particulars are not my measure.
all these i better in one general best.
thy love is better than high birth to me.
richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ costs.
of more delight than hawks and horses be.
and having thee, of all men’s pride i boast.
wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take.
all this away, and me most wretched make.
but do thy worst to steal thyself away.
for term of life thou art assured mine.
and life no longer than thy love will stay.
for it depends upon that love of thine.
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs.
when in the least of them my life hath end.
i see, a better state to me belongs
than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind.
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
o what a happy title do i find.
happy to have thy love, happy to die !
but what’s so blessed-fair that fears no blot ?
thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not.
so shall i live, supposing thou art true.
like a deceived husband, so love’s face.
may still seem love to me, though altered new.
thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
for there can live no hatred in thine eye.
therefore in that i cannot know thy change.
in many’s looks, the false heart’s history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
but heaven in thy creation did decree.
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell.
whatever thy thoughts, or thy heart’s workings be.
thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
how like eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow.
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
they that have power to hurt, and will do none.
that do not do the thing, they most do show.
who moving others, are themselves as stone.
unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow.
they rightly do inherit heaven’s graces.
and husband nature’s riches from expense.
they are the lords and owners of their faces.
others, but stewards of their excellence.
the summer’s flower is to the summer sweet.
though to it self, it only live and die.
but if that flower with base infection meet.
the basest weed outbraves his dignity.
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds.
lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame.
which like a canker in the fragrant rose.
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name !
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose !
that tongue that tells the story of thy days.
( making lascivious comments on thy sport )
cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise.
naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
o what a mansion have those vices got.
which for their habitation chose out thee.
where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot.
and all things turns to fair, that eyes can see !
take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege.
the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness.
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport.
both grace and faults are loved of more and less.
thou makest faults graces, that to thee resort.
as on the finger of a throned queen.
the basest jewel will be well esteemed.
so are those errors that in thee are seen.
to truths translated, and for true things deemed.
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray.
if like a lamb he could his looks translate !
how many gazers mightst thou lead away.
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !
but do not so, i love thee in such sort.
as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year !
what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen !
what old december’s bareness everywhere !
and yet this time removed was summer’s time.
the teeming autumn big with rich increase.
bearing the wanton burden of the prime.
like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease.
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit.
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee.
and thou away, the very birds are mute.
or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer.
that leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.
from you have i been absent in the spring.
when proud-pied april ( dressed in all his trim )
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing.
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him.
yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue.
could make me any summer’s story tell.
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.
nor did i wonder at the lily’s white.
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose.
they were but sweet, but figures of delight.
drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
yet seemed it winter still, and you away.
as with your shadow i with these did play.
the forward violet thus did i chide.
sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells.
if not from my love’s breath ? the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells.
in my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
the lily i condemned for thy hand.
and buds of marjoram had stolen thy hair.
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand.
one blushing shame, another white despair.
a third nor red, nor white, had stolen of both.
and to his robbery had annexed thy breath.
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death.
more flowers i noted, yet i none could see.
but sweet, or colour it had stolen from thee.
where art thou muse that thou forgetest so long.
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?
spendest thou thy fury on some worthless song.
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?
return forgetful muse, and straight redeem.
in gentle numbers time so idly spent.
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem.
and gives thy pen both skill and argument.
rise resty muse, my love’s sweet face survey.
if time have any wrinkle graven there.
if any, be a satire to decay.
and make time’s spoils despised everywhere.
give my love fame faster than time wastes life.
so thou preventest his scythe, and crooked knife.
o truant muse what shall be thy amends.
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed ?
both truth and beauty on my love depends.
so dost thou too, and therein dignified.
make answer muse, wilt thou not haply say.
truth needs no colour with his colour fixed.
beauty no pencil, beauty’s truth to lay.
but best is best, if never intermixed ?
because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb ?
excuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee.
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb.
and to be praised of ages yet to be.
then do thy office muse, i teach thee how.
to make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming.
i love not less, though less the show appear.
that love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming.
the owner’s tongue doth publish every where.
our love was new, and then but in the spring.
when i was wont to greet it with my lays.
as philomel in summer’s front doth sing.
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days.
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night.
but that wild music burthens every bough.
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue.
because i would not dull you with my song.
alack what poverty my muse brings forth.
that having such a scope to show her pride.
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside.
o blame me not if i no more can write !
look in your glass and there appears a face.
that over-goes my blunt invention quite.
dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
were it not sinful then striving to mend.
to mar the subject that before was well ?
for to no other pass my verses tend.
than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
and more, much more than in my verse can sit.
your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
to me fair friend you never can be old.
for as you were when first your eye i eyed.
such seems your beauty still.
three winters cold.
have from the forests shook three summers’ pride.
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned.
in process of the seasons have i seen.
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned.
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green.
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand.
steal from his figure, and no pace perceived.
so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand
hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred.
ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.
let not my love be called idolatry.
nor my beloved as an idol show.
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one, of one, still such, and ever so.
kind is my love today, tomorrow kind.
still constant in a wondrous excellence.
therefore my verse to constancy confined.
one thing expressing, leaves out difference.
fair, kind, and true, is all my argument.
fair, kind, and true, varying to other words.
and in this change is my invention spent.
three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
which three till now, never kept seat in one.
when in the chronicle of wasted time.
i see descriptions of the fairest wights.
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme.
in praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights.
then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best.
of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow.
i see their antique pen would have expressed.
even such a beauty as you master now.
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time, all you prefiguring.
and for they looked but with divining eyes.
they had not skill enough your worth to sing.
for we which now behold these present days.
have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul.
of the wide world, dreaming on things to come.
can yet the lease of my true love control.
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured.
and the sad augurs mock their own presage.
incertainties now crown themselves assured.
and peace proclaims olives of endless age.
now with the drops of this most balmy time.
my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes.
since spite of him i’ll live in this poor rhyme.
while he insults over dull and speechless tribes.
and thou in this shalt find thy monument.
when tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.
what’s in the brain that ink may character.
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit.
what’s new to speak, what now to register.
that may express my love, or thy dear merit ?
nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine.
i must each day say over the very same.
counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine.
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name.
so that eternal love in love’s fresh case.
weighs not the dust and injury of age.
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place.
but makes antiquity for aye his page.
finding the first conceit of love there bred.
where time and outward form would show it dead.
o never say that i was false of heart.
though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
as easy might i from my self depart.
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie.
that is my home of love, if i have ranged.
like him that travels i return again.
just to the time, not with the time exchanged.
so that my self bring water for my stain.
never believe though in my nature reigned.
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood.
that it could so preposterously be stained.
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good.
for nothing this wide universe i call.
save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.
alas ’tis true, i have gone here and there.
and made my self a motley to the view.
gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear.
made old offences of affections new.
most true it is, that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely.
but by all above.
these blenches gave my heart another youth.
and worse essays proved thee my best of love.
now all is done, have what shall have no end.
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof, to try an older friend.
a god in love, to whom i am confined.
then give me welcome, next my heaven the best.
even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
o for my sake do you with fortune chide.
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds.
that did not better for my life provide.
than public means which public manners breeds.
thence comes it that my name receives a brand.
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in, like the dyer’s hand.
pity me then, and wish i were renewed.
whilst like a willing patient i will drink.
potions of eisel against my strong infection.
no bitterness that i will bitter think.
nor double penance to correct correction.
pity me then dear friend, and i assure ye.
even that your pity is enough to cure me.
your love and pity doth the impression fill.
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow.
for what care i who calls me well or ill.
so you over-green my bad, my good allow ?
you are my all the world, and i must strive.
to know my shames and praises from your tongue.
none else to me, nor i to none alive.
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense.
to critic and to flatterer stopped are.
mark how with my neglect i do dispense.
you are so strongly in my purpose bred.
that all the world besides methinks are dead.
since i left you, mine eye is in my mind.
and that which governs me to go about.
doth part his function, and is partly blind.
seems seeing, but effectually is out.
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch.
of his quick objects hath the mind no part.
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch.
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight.
the most sweet favour or deformedest creature.
the mountain, or the sea, the day, or night.
the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
incapable of more, replete with you.
my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarch’s plague this flattery ?
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true.
and that your love taught it this alchemy ?
to make of monsters, and things indigest.
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble.
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble.
o ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing.
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
mine eye well knows what with his gust is agreeing.
and to his palate doth prepare the cup.
if it be poisoned, ’tis the lesser sin.
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
those lines that i before have writ do lie.
even those that said i could not love you dearer.
yet then my judgment knew no reason why.
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
but reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
creep in ’twixt vows, and change decrees of kings.
tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharpest intents.
divert strong minds to the course of altering things.
alas why fearing of time’s tyranny.
might i not then say now i love you best,
when i was certain over incertainty.
crowning the present, doubting of the rest ?
love is a babe, then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow.
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments, love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds.
or bends with the remover to remove.
o no, it is an ever-fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken.
it is the star to every wand’ring bark.
whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.
love’s not time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle’s compass come.
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.
but bears it out even to the edge of doom.
if this be error and upon me proved.
i never writ, nor no man ever loved.
accuse me thus, that i have scanted all.
wherein i should your great deserts repay.
forgot upon your dearest love to call.
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day.
that i have frequent been with unknown minds.
and given to time your own dear-purchased right.
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight.
book both my wilfulness and errors down.
and on just proof surmise, accumulate.
bring me within the level of your frown.
but shoot not at me in your wakened hate.
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love.
like as to make our appetite more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge.
as to prevent our maladies unseen.
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
even so being full of your never-cloying sweetness.
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding.
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness.
to be diseased ere that there was true needing.
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not, grew to faults assured.
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
but thence i learn and find the lesson true.
drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within.
applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears.
still losing when i saw my self to win !
what wretched errors hath my heart committed.
whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never !
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever !
o benefit of ill, now i find true
that better is, by evil still made better.
and ruined love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
so i return rebuked to my content.
and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent.
that you were once unkind befriends me now.
and for that sorrow, which i then did feel.
needs must i under my transgression bow.
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours, y’have passed a hell of time.
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime.
o that our night of woe might have remembered
my deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits.
and soon to you, as you to me then tendered
the humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits !
but that your trespass now becomes a fee.
mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
’tis better to be vile than vile esteemed.
when not to be, receives reproach of being.
and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed.
not by our feeling, but by others’ seeing.
for why should others’ false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood ?
or on my frailties why are frailer spies.
which in their wills count bad what i think good ?
no, i am that i am, and they that level
at my abuses, reckon up their own.
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel.
by their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain.
all men are bad and in their badness reign.
thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
full charactered with lasting memory.
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity.
or at the least, so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist.
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee, thy record never can be missed.
that poor retention could not so much hold.
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score.
therefore to give them from me was i bold.
to trust those tables that receive thee more.
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me.
no ! time, thou shalt not boast that i do change.
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel, nothing strange.
they are but dressings of a former sight.
our dates are brief, and therefore we admire.
what thou dost foist upon us that is old.
and rather make them born to our desire.
than think that we before have heard them told.
thy registers and thee i both defy.
not wond’ring at the present, nor the past.
for thy records, and what we see doth lie.
made more or less by thy continual haste.
this i do vow and this shall ever be.
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
if my dear love were but the child of state.
it might for fortune’s bastard be unfathered.
as subject to time’s love or to time’s hate.
weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
no it was builded far from accident.
it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent.
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls.
it fears not policy that heretic.
which works on leases of short-numbered hours.
but all alone stands hugely politic.
that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
to this i witness call the fools of time.
which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
were’t aught to me i bore the canopy.
with my extern the outward honouring.
or laid great bases for eternity.
which proves more short than waste or ruining ?
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all, and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet.
forgoing simple savour.
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent ?
no, let me be obsequious in thy heart.
and take thou my oblation, poor but free.
which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art.
but mutual render, only me for thee.
hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
when most impeached, stands least in thy control.
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power.
dost hold time’s fickle glass his fickle hour.
who hast by waning grown, and therein showest.
thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.
if nature ( sovereign mistress over wrack )
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back.
she keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
may time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure.
she may detain, but not still keep her treasure !
her audit ( though delayed ) answered must be.
and her quietus is to render thee.
in the old age black was not counted fair.
or if it were it bore not beauty’s name.
but now is black beauty’s successive heir.
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame.
for since each hand hath put on nature’s power.
fairing the foul with art’s false borrowed face.
sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower.
but is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black.
her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack.
slandering creation with a false esteem.
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe.
that every tongue says beauty should look so.
how oft when thou, my music, music playest.
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayest
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds.
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap.
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand.
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap.
at the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand.
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips.
over whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait.
making dead wood more blest than living lips.
since saucy jacks so happy are in this.
give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action, and till action, lust
is perjured, murd’rous, bloody full of blame.
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight.
past reason hunted, and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowed bait.
on purpose laid to make the taker mad.
mad in pursuit and in possession so.
had, having, and in quest, to have extreme.
a bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe.
before a joy proposed behind a dream.
all this the world well knows yet none knows well.
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
my mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun.
coral is far more red, than her lips red.
if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun.
if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
i have seen roses damasked, red and white.
but no such roses see i in her cheeks.
and in some perfumes is there more delight.
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
i love to hear her speak, yet well i know.
that music hath a far more pleasing sound.
i grant i never saw a goddess go.
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare.
as any she belied with false compare.
thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art.
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel.
for well thou knowest to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
yet in good faith some say that thee behold.
thy face hath not the power to make love groan.
to say they err, i dare not be so bold.
although i swear it to my self alone.
and to be sure that is not false i swear.
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face.
one on another’s neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place.
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds.
and thence this slander as i think proceeds.
thine eyes i love, and they as pitying me.
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain.
have put on black, and loving mourners be.
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east.
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face.
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace.
and suit thy pity like in every part.
then will i swear beauty herself is black.
and all they foul that thy complexion lack.
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
is’t not enough to torture me alone.
but slave to slavery my sweetest friend must be ?
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken.
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed.
of him, my self, and thee i am forsaken.
a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed.
prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward.
but then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail.
whoever keeps me, let my heart be his guard.
thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
and yet thou wilt, for i being pent in thee.
perforce am thine and all that is in me.
so now i have confessed that he is thine.
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will.
my self i’ll forfeit, so that other mine.
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still.
but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free.
for thou art covetous, and he is kind.
he learned but surety-like to write for me.
under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take.
thou usurer that putest forth all to use.
and sue a friend, came debtor for my sake.
so him i lose through my unkind abuse.
him have i lost, thou hast both him and me.
he pays the whole, and yet am i not free.
whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will.
and will to boot, and will in overplus.
more than enough am i that vex thee still.
to thy sweet will making addition thus.
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious.
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?
shall will in others seem right gracious.
and in my will no fair acceptance shine ?
the sea all water, yet receives rain still.
and in abundance addeth to his store.
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more.
let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill.
think all but one, and me in that one will.
if thy soul check thee that i come so near.
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will.
and will thy soul knows is admitted there.
thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
will will fulfil the treasure of thy love.
ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
in things of great receipt with case we prove.
among a number one is reckoned none.
then in the number let me pass untold.
though in thy store’s account i one must be.
for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold.
that nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
make but my name thy love, and love that still.
and then thou lovest me for my name is will.
thou blind fool love, what dost thou to mine eyes.
that they behold and see not what they see ?
they know what beauty is, see where it lies.
yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks.
be anchored in the bay where all men ride.
why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks.
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
why should my heart think that a several plot.
which my heart knows the wide world’s common place ?
or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face ?
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred.
and to this false plague are they now transferred.
when my love swears that she is made of truth.
i do believe, her though i know she lies.
that she might think me some untutored youth.
unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young.
although she knows my days are past the best.
simply i credit her false-speaking tongue.
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
but wherefore says she not she is unjust ?
and wherefore say not i that i am old ?
o love’s best habit is in seeming trust.
and age in love loves not to have years told.
therefore i lie with her, and she with me.
and in our faults by lies we flattered be.
o call not me to justify the wrong.
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart.
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue.
use power with power, and slay me not by art.
tell me thou lovest elsewhere.
but in my sight.
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside.
what needest thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my overpressed defence can bide ?
let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows.
her pretty looks have been mine enemies.
and therefore from my face she turns my foes.
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries.
yet do not so, but since i am near slain.
kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain.
lest sorrow lend me words and words express.
the manner of my pity-wanting pain.
if i might teach thee wit better it were.
though not to love, yet love to tell me so.
as testy sick men when their deaths be near.
no news but health from their physicians know.
for if i should despair i should grow mad.
and in my madness might speak ill of thee.
now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad.
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
that i may not be so, nor thou belied.
bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes.
for they in thee a thousand errors note.
but ’tis my heart that loves what they despise.
who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted.
nor tender feeling to base touches prone.
nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone.
but my five wits, nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee.
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man.
thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be.
only my plague thus far i count my gain.
that she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate.
hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
o but with mine, compare thou thine own state.
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving.
or if it do, not from those lips of thine.
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments.
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine.
robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those.
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee.
root pity in thy heart that when it grows.
thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide.
by self-example mayst thou be denied.
lo as a careful huswife runs to catch.
one of her feathered creatures broke away.
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay.
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase.
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent.
to follow that which flies before her face.
not prizing her poor infant’s discontent.
so runest thou after that which flies from thee.
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind.
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me.
and play the mother’s part, kiss me, be kind.
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will.
if thou turn back and my loud crying still.
two loves i have, of comfort and despair.
which, like two spirits, do suggest me still.
the better angel is a man right fair.
the worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side.
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil.
wooing his purity with her foul pride.
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may, yet not directly tell.
but being both from me both to each friend.
i guess one angel in another’s hell.
yet this shall i never know, but live in doubt.
till my bad angel fire my good one out.
those lips that love’s own hand did make.
breathed forth the sound that said i hate.
to me that languished for her sake.
but when she saw my woeful state.
straight in her heart did mercy come.
chiding that tongue that ever sweet.
was used in giving gentle doom.
and taught it thus anew to greet.
i hate she altered with an end.
that followed it as gentle day.
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away.
i hate, from hate away she threw.
and saved my life saying not you.
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth.
my sinful earth these rebel powers array.
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay ?
why so large cost having so short a lease.
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ?
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge ? is this thy body’s end ?
then soul live thou upon thy servant’s loss.
and let that pine to aggravate thy store.
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross.
within be fed, without be rich no more.
so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men.
and death once dead, there’s no more dying then.
my love is as a fever longing still.
for that which longer nurseth the disease.
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill.
the uncertain sickly appetite to please.
my reason the physician to my love.
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me, and i desperate now approve.
desire is death, which physic did except.
past cure i am, now reason is past care.
and frantic-mad with evermore unrest.
my thoughts and my discourse as mad men’s are.
at random from the truth vainly expressed.
for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright.
who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head.
which have no correspondence with true sight.
or if they have, where is my judgment fled.
that censures falsely what they see aright ?
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote.
what means the world to say it is not so ?
if it be not, then love doth well denote.
love’s eye is not so true as all men’s.
how can it ? o how can love’s eye be true.
that is so vexed with watching and with tears ?
no marvel then though i mistake my view.
the sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
o cunning love, with tears thou keepest me blind.
lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
canst thou o cruel, say i love thee not.
when i against my self with thee partake ?
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake ?
who hateth thee that i do call my friend.
on whom frownest thou that i do fawn upon.
nay if thou lourest on me do i not spend
revenge upon my self with present moan ?
what merit do i in my self respect.
that is so proud thy service to despise.
when all my best doth worship thy defect.
commanded by the motion of thine eyes ?
but love hate on for now i know thy mind.
those that can see thou lovest, and i am blind.
o from what power hast thou this powerful might.
with insufficiency my heart to sway.
to make me give the lie to my true sight.
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day ?
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill.
that in the very refuse of thy deeds.
there is such strength and warrantise of skill.
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds ?
who taught thee how to make me love thee more.
the more i hear and see just cause of hate ?
o though i love what others do abhor.
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
if thy unworthiness raised love in me.
more worthy i to be beloved of thee.
love is too young to know what conscience is.
yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss.
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
for thou betraying me, i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body’s treason.
my soul doth tell my body that he may.
triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason.
but rising at thy name doth point out thee.
as his triumphant prize, proud of this pride.
he is contented thy poor drudge to be.
to stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
no want of conscience hold it that i call.
her love, for whose dear love i rise and fall.
in loving thee thou knowest i am forsworn.
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing.
in act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn.
in vowing new hate after new love bearing.
but why of two oaths’ breach do i accuse thee.
when i break twenty ? i am perjured most.
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee.
and all my honest faith in thee is lost.
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness.
oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy.
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness.
or made them swear against the thing they see.
for i have sworn thee fair.
more perjured i.
to swear against the truth so foul a lie.
cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
a maid of dian’s this advantage found.
and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley-fountain of that ground.
which borrowed from this holy fire of love.
a dateless lively heat still to endure.
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove.
against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
but at my mistress’ eye love’s brand new-fired.
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast.
i sick withal the help of bath desired.
and thither hied a sad distempered guest.
but found no cure, the bath for my help lies.
where cupid got new fire.
my mistress’ eyes.
the little love-god lying once asleep.
laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand.
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep.
came tripping by, but in her maiden hand.
the fairest votary took up that fire.
which many legions of true hearts had warmed.
and so the general of hot desire.
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
this brand she quenched in a cool well by.
which from love’s fire took heat perpetual.
growing a bath and healthful remedy.
for men diseased.
but i, my mistress’ thrall.
came there for cure and this by that i prove.
love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.
the first book of moses, called genesis.
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth.
and the earth was without form.
void and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters.
and god said, let there be light.
and there was light.
and god saw the light, that it was good.
and god divided the light from the darkness.
god called the light day, and the darkness he called night.
and the evening and the morning were the first day.
and god said, let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters.
and let it divide the waters from the waters.
and god made the firmament, and divided the waters.
which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.
and god called the firmament heaven.
and the evening and the morning were the second day.
and god said, let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place.
and let the dry land appear, and it was so.
and god called the dry land earth.
the gathering together of the waters called he seas.
and god saw that it was good.
and god said, let the earth bring forth grass.
the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind.
the seed is in itself, upon the earth.
and the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind.
and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself.
and the evening and the morning were the third day.
and god said, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night.
and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.
and it was so.
and god made two great lights.
the greater light to rule the day.
and the lesser light to rule the night.
he made the stars also.
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.
and god saw that it was good.
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
and god said, let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life.
and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
and god created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind.
and every winged fowl after his kind.
and god saw that it was good.
and god blessed them, saying, be fruitful, and multiply.
and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
and god said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle.
and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind.
and it was so.
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind.
and god saw that it was good.
and god said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air.
and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
so god created man in his own image, in the image of god created he him.
male and female created he them.
and god blessed them, and god said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
the first book of optics.
my design in this book is not to explain the properties of light by hypotheses.
but to propose and prove them by reason and experiments.
in order to which i shall premise the following definitions and axioms.
by the rays of light i understand its least parts.
and those as well successive in the same lines as contemporary in several lines.
for it is manifest that light consists of parts, both successive and contemporary.
because in the same place you may stop that which comes one moment.
and let pass that which comes presently after.
and in the same time you may stop it in any one place, and let it pass in any other. 
for that part of light which is stopped cannot be the same with that which is let pass. 
the least light or part of light, which may be stopped alone without the rest of the light, or propagated alone.
or do or suffer any thing alone, which the rest of the light doth not or suffers not, i call a ray of light.
we sailed from peru, ( where we had continued for the space of one whole year ) for china and japan, by the south sea ;
taking with us victuals for twelve months ;
and had good winds from the east, though soft and weak, for five months space, and more
but the wind came about, and settled in the west for many days, so as we could make little or no way.
and were sometime in purpose to turn back
but then again there arose strong and great winds from the south, with a point east.
which carried us up ( for all that we could do ) towards the north ;
by which time our victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them
so that finding ourselves, in the midst of the greatest wilderness of waters in the world.
without victuals, we gave ourselves for lost men and prepared for death
yet we did lift up our hearts and voices to god above.
who showeth his wonders in the deep, beseeching him of his mercy.
he discovered the face of the deep, and brought forth dry land.
so he would now discover land to us, that we might not perish.
and it came to pass that the next day about evening we saw within a kenning before us.
towards the north, as it were thick clouds, which did put us in some hope of land ;
knowing how that part of the south sea was utterly unknown ;
and might have islands, or continents, that hitherto were not come to light
wherefore we bent our course thither, where we saw the appearance of land, all that night ;
and in the dawning of the next day, we might plainly discern that it was a land ;
flat to our sight, and full of boscage ;
which made it show the more dark
and after an hour and a half’s sailing, we entered into a good haven, being the port of a fair city ;
not great indeed, but well built, and that gave a pleasant view from the sea :
and we thinking every minute long, till we were on land, came close to the shore, and offered to land
but straightways we saw divers of the people.
with bastons in their hands ( as it were ) forbidding us to land ;
yet without any cries of fierceness, but only as warning us off, by signs that they made
whereupon being not a little discomforted, we were advising with ourselves, what we should do.
during which time, there made forth to us a small boat, with about eight persons in it ;
whereof one of them had in his hand a tipstaff of a yellow cane.
tipped at both ends with blue, who came aboard our ship, without any show of distrust at all
and when he saw one of our number, present himself somewhat before the rest.
he drew forth a little scroll of parchment.
somewhat yellower than our parchment, and shining like the leaves of writing tables.
but otherwise soft and flexible, and delivered it to our foremost man.
in which scroll were written in ancient hebrew, and in ancient greek.
and in good latin of the school, and in spanish, these words :
land ye not, none of you ;
and provide to be gone from this coast, within sixteen days.
except you have further time given you
meanwhile, if you want fresh water or victuals, or help for your sick.
or that your ship needeth repairs, write down your wants, and you shall have that, which belongeth to mercy
this scroll was signed with a stamp of cherubim :
wings, not spread, but hanging downwards ;
and by them a cross
this being delivered, the officer returned.
and left only a servant with us to receive our answer.
consulting hereupon amongst ourselves, we were much perplexed
the denial of landing and hasty warning us away troubled us much ;
on the other side, to find that the people had languages.
and were so full of humanity, did comfort us not a little
and above all, the sign of the cross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing.
and as it were a certain presage of good
our answer was in the spanish tongue ;
that for our ship, it was well ;
for we had rather met with calms and contrary winds than any tempests
for our sick, they were many, and in very ill case ;
so that if they were not permitted to land, they ran danger of their lives
our other wants we set down in particular ;
adding, that we had some little store of merchandise.
which if it pleased them to deal for, it might supply our wants.
without being chargeable unto them
we offered some reward in pistolets unto the servant.
and a piece of crimson velvet to be presented to the officer ;
but the servant took them not, nor would scarce look upon them ;
and so left us, and went back in another little boat, which was sent for him.
about three hours after we had dispatched our answer.
there came towards us a person ( as it seemed ) of place
he had on him a gown with wide sleeves, of a kind of water chamolet.
of an excellent azure colour, fair more glossy than ours ;
his under apparel was green ;
and so was his hat, being in the form of a turban, daintily made.
and not so huge as the turkish turbans ;
and the locks of his hair came down below the brims of it
a reverend man was he to behold
he came in a boat, gilt in some part of it, with four persons more only in that boat ;
and was followed by another boat, wherein were some twenty
when he was come within a flightshot of our ship, signs were made to us.
that we should send forth some to meet him upon the water ;
which we presently did in our ship-boat, sending the principal man amongst us save one.
and four of our number with him.
when we were come within six yards of their boat, they called to us to stay.
and not to approach farther ;
which we did
and thereupon the man, whom i before described, stood up.
and with a loud voice, in spanish, asked, are ye christians ?
we answered, we were ;
fearing the less, because of the cross we had seen in the subscription
at which answer the said person lifted up his right hand towards heaven.
and drew it softly to his mouth ( which is the gesture they use, when they thank god ) and then said :
if ye will swear ( all of you ) by the merits of the saviour, that ye are no pirates.
nor have shed blood, lawfully, nor unlawfully within forty days past, you may have licence to come on land
we said, we were all ready to take that oath
whereupon one of those that were with him.
being ( as it seemed ) a notary, made an entry of this act
which done, another of the attendants of the great person which was with him in the same boat.
after his lord had spoken a little to him, said aloud :
my lord would have you know, that it is not of pride, or greatness.
that he cometh not aboard your ship ;
but for that in your answer you declare that you have many sick amongst you.
he was warned by the conservator of health of the city that he should keep a distance
we bowed ourselves towards him, and answered, we were his humble servants ;
and accounted for great honour, and singular humanity towards us, that which was already done ;
but hoped well, that the nature of the sickness of our men was not infectious
so he returned ;
and a while after came the notary to us aboard our ship ;
holding in his hand a fruit of that country, like an orange.
but of color between orange-tawney and scarlet ;
which cast a most excellent odour
he used it ( as it seemeth ) for a preservative against infection
he gave us our oath ;
by the name of jesus, and his merits :
and after told us, that the next day, by six of the clock.
in the morning, we should be sent to, and brought to the strangers' house, ( so he called it, ).
where we should be accommodated of things, both for our whole, and for our sick.
so he left us ;
and when we offered him some pistolets, he smiling said.
he must not be twice paid for one labour :
meaning ( as i take it ) that he had salary sufficient of the state for his service
for ( as i after learned ) they call an officer that taketh rewards, twice paid
the next morning early, there came to us the same officer that came to us at first with his cane.
and told us, he came to conduct us to the strangers' house ;
and that he had prevented the hour, because we might have the whole day before us
for, said he, if you will follow my advice, there shall first go with me some few of you.
and see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you ;
and then you may send for your sick, and the rest of your number.
which ye will bring on land
we thanked him, and said, that this care.
which he took of desolate strangers, god would reward
and so six of us went on land with him :
and when we were on land, he went before us, and turned to us.
and said, he was but our servant, and our guide
he led us through three fair streets ;
and all the way we went, there were gathered some people on both sides, standing in a row ;
but in so civil a fashion, as if it had been, not to wonder at us, but to welcome us :
and divers of them, as we passed by them, put their arms a little abroad ;
which is their gesture, when they did bid any welcome.
the strangers' house is a fair and spacious house, built of brick, of somewhat a bluer colour than our brick ;
and with handsome windows, some of glass, some of a kind of cambric oiled
he brought us first into a fair parlour above stairs, and then asked us.
what number of persons we were ?
and how many sick ?
we answered, we were in all, ( sick and whole, ) one and fifty persons.
whereof our sick were seventeen
he desired us to have patience a little, and to stay till he came back to us ;
which was about an hour after ;
and then he led us to see the chambers which were provided for us, being in number nineteen :
they having cast it ( as it seemeth ) that four of those chambers.
which were better than the rest, might receive four of the principal men of our company ;
and lodge them alone by themselves ;
and the other fifteen chambers were to lodge us two and two together
the chambers were handsome and cheerful chambers, and furnished civilly
then he led us to a long gallery, like a dorture, where he showed us all along the one side.
seventeen cells, very neat ones, having partitions of cedar wood
which gallery and cells, being in all forty, many more than we needed.
were instituted as an infirmary for sick persons
and he told us withal, that as any of our sick waxed well.
he might be removed from his cell, to a chamber ;
for which purpose there were set forth ten spare chambers.
besides the number we spake of before
this done, he brought us back to the parlour, and lifting up his cane a little.
ye are to know, that the custom of the land requireth.
that after this day and to-morrow, you are to keep within doors for three days
but let it not trouble you, nor do not think yourselves restrained.
but rather left to your rest and ease
you shall want nothing, and there are six of our people appointed to attend you.
for any business you may have abroad
we gave him thanks, with all affection and respect, and said.
god surely is manifested in this land
we offered him also twenty pistolets ;
but he smiled, and only said ;
what ?
twice paid !
and so he left us.
soon after our dinner was served in ;
which was right good viands, both for bread and treat :
better than any collegiate diet, that i have known in europe
we had also drink of three sorts, all wholesome and good ;
wine of the grape ;
a drink of grain, such as is with us our ale, but more clear :
and a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country ;
a wonderful pleasing and refreshing drink
besides, there were brought in to us, great store of those scarlet oranges, for our sick ;
which ( they said ) were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea
there was given us also, a box of small gray, or whitish pills.
which they wished our sick should take, one of the pills, every night before sleep ;
which ( they said ) would hasten their recovery.
the next day, after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our men and goods out of our ship.
was somewhat settled and quiet, i thought good to call our company together ;
and when they were assembled, said unto them ;
my dear friends, let us know ourselves, and how it standeth with us
we are men cast on land, as jonas was, out of the whale’s belly.
when we were as buried in the deep :
and now we are on land, we are but between death and life ;
for we are beyond, both the old world, and the new ;
and whether ever we shall see europe, god only knoweth
it is a kind of miracle bath brought us hither :
and it must be little less, that shall bring us hence
therefore in regard of our deliverance past, and our danger present.
and to come, let us look up to god, and every man reform his own ways
besides we are come here amongst a christian people, full of piety and humanity :
let us not bring that confusion of face upon ourselves, as to show our vices, or unworthiness before them
yet there is more
for they have by commandment, ( though in form of courtesy ) cloistered us within these wall, for three days :
who knoweth, whether it be not, to take some taste of our manners and conditions ?
and if they find them bad, to banish us straightways ;
if good, to give us further time
for these men that they have given us for attendance, may withal have an eye upon us
therefore for god’s love, and as we love the weal of our souls and bodies.
let us so behave ourselves, as we may be at peace with god.
and may find grace in the eyes of this people
our company with one voice thanked me for my good admonition.
he promised me to live soberly and civilly.
and without giving any the least occasion of offence
so we spent our three days joyfully and without care.
in expectation what would be done with us, when they were expired
during which time, we had every hour joy of the amendment of our sick ;
who thought themselves cast into some divine pool of healing ;
they mended so kindly, and so fast.
the morrow after our three days were past, there came to us a new man.
we had not seen him before, clothed in blue as the former was.
save that his turban was white, with a small red cross on the top
he had also a tippet of fine linen
at his coming in, he did bend to us a little, and put his arms abroad
we of our parts saluted him in a very lowly and submissive manner ;
as looking that from him, we should receive sentence of life, or death :
he desired to speak with some few of us :
whereupon six of us only staid, and the rest avoided the room
he said, i am by office governor of this house of strangers.
and by vocation i am a christian priest :
and therefore am come to you to offer you my service.
both as strangers and chiefly as christians
some things i may tell you, which i think you will not be unwilling to hear
the state hath given you license to stay on land, for the space of six weeks ;
and let it not trouble you, if your occasions ask further time.
for the law in this point is not precise ;
and i do not doubt, but my self shall be able, to obtain for you such further time, as may be convenient
ye shall also understand, that the strangers' house is at this time rich, and much aforehand ;
for it hath laid up revenue these thirty-seven years ;
for so long it is since any stranger arrived in this part :
and therefore take ye no care ;
the state will defray you all the time you stay ;
neither shall you stay one day the less for that
as for any merchandise ye have brought, ye shall be well used.
and have your return, either in merchandise, or in gold and silver :
for to us it is all one
and if you have any other request to make, hide it not
for ye shall find we will not make your countenance to fall by the answer ye shall receive
only this i must tell you, that none of you must go above a karan.
from the walls of the city, without especial leave
we answered, after we had looked awhile one upon another, admiring this gracious and parent-like usage ;
that we could not tell what to say :
for we wanted words to express our thanks ;
and his noble free offers left us nothing to ask
it seemed to us, that we had before us a picture of our salvation in heaven ;
for we that were a while since in the jaws of death, were now brought into a place.
where we found nothing but consolations
for the commandment laid upon us, we would not fail to obey it.
it was impossible but our hearts should be enflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground
we added, that our tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths.
ere we should forget, either his reverend person, or this whole nation, in our prayers
we also most humbly besought him, to accept of us as his true servants ;
by as just a right as ever men on earth were bounden ;
laying and presenting, both our persons, and all we had, at his feet
he said ;
he was a priest, and looked for a priest’s reward ;
which was our brotherly love, and the good of our souls and bodies
so he went from us, not without tears of tenderness in his eyes ;
and left us also confused with joy and kindness, saying amongst ourselves ;
that we were come into a land of angels, which did appear to us daily.
the next day about ten of the clock, the governor came to us again, and after salutations, said familiarly ;
that he was come to visit us ;
and called for a chair, and sat him down :
and we, being some ten of us, sat down with him, and when we were set, he began thus :
we of this island of bensalem, have this ;
that by means of our solitary situation ;
and of the laws of secrecy, which we have for our travellers, and our rare admission of strangers ;
we know well most part of the habitable world, and are ourselves unknown
therefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions.
it is more reason, for the entertainment of the time, that ye ask me questions, than that i ask you
we answered ;
that we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave so to do :
and that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there was no worldly thing on earth.
more worthy to be known than the state of that happy land
but above all, since that we were met from the several ends of the world.
we should meet one day in the kingdom of heaven, who was the apostle of that nation.
and how it was converted to the faith ?
it appeared in his face that he took great contentment in this our question :
he said ;
ye knit my heart to you, by asking this question in the first place ;
for it sheweth that you first seek the kingdom of heaven ;
and i shall gladly, and briefly, satisfy your demand.
about twenty years after the ascension of our saviour, it came to pass.
that there was seen by the people of renfusa.
the night was cloudy and calm as it might be some mile into the sea, a great pillar of light ;
not sharp, but in form of a column, or cylinder.
rising from the sea a great way up towards heaven ;
and on the top of it was seen a large cross of light.
more bright and resplendent than the body of the pillar
upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city gathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder ;
and so after put themselves into a number of small boats.
to go nearer to this marvellous sight
but when the boats were come within about sixty yards of the pillar.
they found themselves all bound, and could go no further ;
yet so as they might move to go about, but might not approach nearer :
so as the boats stood all as in a theatre, beholding this light as an heavenly sign
it so fell out, that there was in one of the boats one of the wise men, of the society of salomon’s house ;
which house, or college is the very eye of this kingdom ;
who having awhile attentively and devoutly viewed and contemplated this pillar and cross, fell down upon his face ;
and then raised himself upon his knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, made his prayers in this manner.
lord god of heaven and earth, thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to those of our order.
to know thy works of creation, and the secrets of them :
and to discern between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art.
and impostures and illusions of all sorts
i do here acknowledge and testify before this people.
that the thing which we now see before our eyes is thy finger and a true miracle
and forasmuch as we learn in our books that thou never workest miracles.
but to divine and excellent end.
the laws of nature are thine own laws.
and thou exceedest them not but upon great cause.
we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign.
and to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy ;
which thou dost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us
when he had made his prayer, he presently found the boat he was in, moveable and unbound ;
whereas all the rest remained still fast ;
and taking that for an assurance of leave to approach.
he caused the boat to be softly and with silence rowed towards the pillar
but ere he came near it, the pillar and cross of light brake up, and cast itself abroad ;
which also vanished soon after, and there was nothing left to be seen.
and in the fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small green branch of palm ;
and when the wise man had taken it, with all reverence, into his boat.
it opened of itself, and there were found in it a book and a letter ;
both written in fine parchment, and wrapped in sindons of linen
the book contained all the canonical books of the old and new testament, according as you have them ;
for we know well what the churches with you receive ;
and the apocalypse itself, and some other books of the new testament.
which were not at that time written, were nevertheless in the book
and for the letter, it was in these words :
i, bartholomew, a servant of the highest, and apostle of jesus christ.
was warned by an angel that appeareth to me, in a vision of glory.
i should commit this ark to the floods of the sea
therefore i do testify and declare unto that people where god shall ordain this ark to come to land.
in the same day is come unto them salvation and peace and good-will, from the father, and from the lord jesus
there was also in both these writings, as well the book, as the letter, wrought a great miracle.
conform to that of the apostles, in the original gift of tongues
for there being at that time in this land hebrews, persians, and indians, besides the natives.
every one read upon the book, and letter, as if they had been written in his own language
and thus was this land saved from infidelity by an ark.
through the apostolical and miraculous evangelism of saint bartholomew
and here he paused, and a messenger came, and called him from us
so this was all that passed in that conference.
the next day, the same governor came again to us, immediately after dinner, and excused himself, saying ;
that the day before he was called from us, somewhat abruptly, but now he would make us amends.
spend time with us if we held his company and conference agreeable
we answered, that we held it so agreeable and pleasing to us.
as we forgot both dangers past and fears to come, for the time we hear him speak ;
and that we thought an hour spent with him, was worth years of our former life
he bowed himself a little to us, and after we were set again, he said ;
well, the questions are on your part
one of our number said, after a little pause ;
that there was a matter, we were no less desirous to know.
than fearful to ask, lest we might presume too far
but encouraged by his rare humanity towards us, we would take the hardiness to propound it :
humbly beseeching him, if he thought it not fit to be answered, that he would pardon it, though he rejected it
we said ;
we well observed those his words, which he formerly spake.
this happy island, where we now stood, was known to few.
and yet knew most of the nations of the world ;
which we found to be true, considering they had the languages of europe.
and knew much of our state and business ;
and yet we in europe, never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island
this we found wonderful strange ;
for that all nations have inter-knowledge one of another.
either by voyage into foreign parts, or by strangers that come to them :
and though the traveller into a foreign country, doth commonly know more by the eye.
he that stayeth at home can by relation of the traveller ;
yet both ways suffice to make a mutual knowledge, in some degree, on both parts
but for this island, we never heard tell of any ship of theirs that had been seen to arrive upon any shore of europe ;
nor of either the east or west indies ;
nor yet of any ship of any other part of the world, that had made return from them
and yet the marvel rested not in this
for the situation of it ( as his lordship said ) in the secret conclave' of such a vast sea might cause it
but then, that they should have knowledge of the languages, books, affairs, of those that lie such a distance from them.
it was a thing we could not tell what to make of ;
for that it seemed to us a conditioner and propriety of divine powers and beings, to be hidden and unseen to others.
and yet to have others open and as in a light to them.
at this speech the governor gave a gracious smile, and said ;
that we did well to ask pardon for this question we now asked :
for that it imported, as if we thought this land, a land of magicians, that sent forth spirits of the air into all parts.
to bring them news and intelligence of other countries
it was answered by us all, in all possible humbleness.
but yet with a countenance taking knowledge, that we knew that he spake it but merrily.
we were apt enough to think there was somewhat supernatural in this island ;
but yet rather as angelical than magical
but to let his lordship know truly what it was that made us tender and doubtful to ask this question.
it was not any such conceit, but because we remembered, he had given a touch in his former speech.
this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers.
to this he said ;
you remember it aright and therefore in that i shall say to you.
i must reserve some particulars, which it is not lawful for me to reveal ;
but there will be enough left, to give you satisfaction
you shall understand that about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, the navigation of the world, was greater than at this day.
do not think with yourselves, that i know not how much it is increased with you, within these six-score years :
i know it well :
and yet i say greater then than now ;
whether it was, that the example of the ark, that saved the remnant of men from the universal deluge, gave men confidence to adventure upon the waters ;
or what it was ;
but such is the truth
the phoenicians, and especially the tyrians, had great fleets
so had the carthaginians their colony, which is yet further west
toward the east the shipping of egypt and of palestine was likewise great
china also, and the great atlantis, ( that you call america, ) which have now but junks and canoes, abounded then in tall ships
this island, ( as appeareth by faithful registers of those times, ) had then fifteen hundred strong ships, of great content
of all this, there is with you sparing memory, or none ;
but we have large knowledge thereof.
at that time, this land was known and frequented by the ships and vessels of all the nations before named
and ( as it cometh to pass ) they had many times men of other countries, that were no sailors, that came with them ;
as persians, chaldeans, arabians ;
so as almost all nations of might and fame resorted hither ;
of whom we have some stirps, and little tribes with us at this day
and for our own ships, they went sundry voyages, as well to your straits, which you call the pillars of hercules.
as to other parts in the atlantic and mediterrane seas ;
as to paguin, ( which is the same with cambaline, ) and quinzy, upon the oriental seas, as far as to the borders of the east tartary.
at the same time, and an age after, or more, the inhabitants of the great atlantis did flourish
for though the narration and description, which is made by a great man with you ;
that the descendants of neptune planted there ;
and of the magnificent temple, palace, city, and hill ;
and the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers, ( which as so many chains environed the same site and temple ) ;
and the several degrees of ascent, whereby men did climb up to the same, as if it had been a scala coeli, be all poetical and fabulous :
yet so much is true, that the said country of atlantis, as well that of peru, then called coya, as that of mexico.
so mighty, as at one time ( or at least within the space of ten years ) they both made two great expeditions ;
they of tyrambel through the atlantic to the mediterrane sea ;
and they of coya through the south sea upon this our island :
and for the former of these, which was into europe, the same author amongst you had some relation from the egyptian priest whom he cited
for assuredly such a thing there was
but whether it were the ancient athenians that had the glory of the repulse and resistance of those forces, i can say nothing :
but certain it is, there never came back either ship or man from that voyage
neither had the other voyage of those of coya upon us had better fortune, if they had not met with enemies of greater clemency
for the king of this island, ( by name altabin, ) a wise man and a great warrior.
he handled the matter so, as he cut off their land-forces from their ships ;
and entoiled both their navy and their tamp with a greater power than theirs, both by sea and land :
arid compelled them to render themselves without striking stroke and after they were at his mercy.
contenting himself only with their oath that they should no more bear arms against him, dismissed them all in safety.
but the divine revenge overtook not long after those proud enterprises
for within less than the space of one hundred years, the great atlantis was utterly lost and destroyed :
not by a great earthquake, as your man saith ;
( for that whole tract is little subject to earthquakes ; ) but by a particular' deluge or inundation ;
those countries having, at this day, far greater rivers and far higher mountains to pour down waters, than any part of the old world
but it is true that the same inundation was not deep ;
not past forty foot, in most places, from the ground ;
so that although it destroyed man and beast generally, yet some few wild inhabitants of the wood escaped
birds also were saved by flying to the high trees and woods
for as for men, although they had buildings in many places, higher than the depth of the water, yet that inundation had a long continuance ;
whereby they of the vale that were not drowned, perished for want of food and other things necessary.
so as marvel you not at the thin population of america, nor at the rudeness and ignorance of the people ;
for you must account your inhabitants of america as a young people ;
younger a thousand years, at the least, than the rest of the world :
for that there was so much time between the universal flood and their particular inundation
for the poor remnant of human seed, which remained in their mountains, peopled the country again slowly, by little and little ;
and being simple and savage people, they were not able to leave letters, arts, and civility to their posterity ;
and having likewise in their mountainous habitations been used to clothe themselves with the skins of tigers.
when after they came down into the valley, and found the intolerable heats which are there.
they knew no means of lighter apparel, they were forced to begin the custom of going naked, which continueth at this day
only they take great pride and delight in the feathers of birds ;
and this also they took from those their ancestors of the mountains, who were invited unto it by the infinite flights of birds that came up to the high grounds.
the waters stood below
so you see, by this main accident of time, we lost our traffic with the americans.
they lay nearest to us, we had most commerce.
as for the other parts of the world, it is most manifest that in the ages following navigation did every where greatly decay ;
and specially far voyages were altogether left and omitted
so then, that part of intercourse which could be from other nations to sail to us, you see how it hath long since ceased ;
except it were by some rare accident, as this of yours
but now of the cessation of that other part of intercourse, which might be by our sailing to other nations, i must yield you some other cause
for i cannot say ( if i shall say truly, ) but our shipping, for number, strength, mariners, pilots.
and therefore why we should sit at home, i shall now give you an account by itself :
and it will draw nearer to give you satisfaction to your principal question.
there reigned in this land, about nineteen hundred years ago, a king, whose memory of all others we most adore ;
not superstitiously, but as a divine instrument, though a mortal man ;
his name was solamona :
and we esteem him as the lawgiver of our nation
this king had a large heart, inscrutable for good ;
and was wholly bent to make his kingdom and people happy
he therefore, taking into consideration how sufficient and substantive this land was to maintain itself without any aid ( at all ) of the foreigner ;
being five thousand six hundred miles in circuit, and of rare fertility of soil in the greatest part thereof ;
and finding also the shipping of this country might be plentifully set on work, both by fishing and by transportations from port to port.
and likewise by sailing unto some small islands that are not far from us, and are under the crown and laws of this state ;
and, recalling into his memory the happy and flourishing estate wherein this land then was ;
so as it might be a thousand ways altered to the worse, but scarce any one way to the better ;
thought nothing wanted to his noble and heroical intentions, but only to give perpetuity to that which was in his time so happily established
therefore amongst his other fundamental laws of this kingdom, he did ordain the interdicts and prohibitions which we have touching entrance of strangers ;
which at that time ( though it was after the calamity of america ) was frequent ;
doubting novelties, and commixture of manners
it is true, the like law against the admission of strangers without licence is an ancient law in the kingdom of china, and yet continued in use
but there it is a poor thing ;
and hath made them a curious, ignorant, fearful, foolish nation
but our lawgiver made his law of another temper
for first, he hath preserved all points of humanity, in taking order and making provision for the relief of strangers distressed ;
whereof you have tasted
at which speech ( as reason was ) we all rose up and bowed ourselves
he went on.
that king also, still desiring to join humanity and policy together ;
and thinking it against humanity, to detain strangers here against their wills.
and against policy that they should return and discover their knowledge of this estate, he took this course :
he did ordain that of the strangers that should be permitted to land, as many ( at all times ) might depart as would ;
but as many as would stay should have very good conditions and means to live from the state
wherein he saw so far, that now in so many ages since the prohibition, we have memory not of one ship that ever returned.
and but of thirteen persons only, at several times, that chose to return in our bottoms
what those few that returned may have reported abroad i know not
but you must think, whatsoever they have said could be taken where they came but for a dream
now for our travelling from henna into parts abroad, our lawgiver thought fit altogether to restrain it
so is it not in china
for the chinese sail where they will or can ;
which sheweth that their law of keeping out strangers is a law of pusillanimity and fear
but this restraint of ours hath one only exception, which is admirable ;
preserving the good which cometh by communicating with strangers, and avoiding the hurt ;
and i will now open it to you
and here i shall seem a little to digress, but you will by and by find it pertinent.
ye shall understand ( my dear friends ) that amongst the excellent acts of that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence
it was the erection and institution of an order or society, which we call salomon’s house ;
the noblest foundation ( as we think ) that ever was upon the earth ;
and the lanthorn of this kingdom
it is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of god
some think it beareth the founder’s name a little corrupted, as if it should be solamona’s house
but the records write it as it is spoken
so as i take it to be denominate of the king of the hebrews, which is famous with you, and no stranger to us
for we have some parts of his works, which with you are lost ;
namely, that natural history, which he wrote, of all plants, from the cedar of libanus to the moss that groweth out of the wall.
and of all things that have life and motion
this maketh me think that our king, finding himself to symbolize in many things with that king of the hebrews, honored him with the title of this foundation
and i am rather induced to be of this opinion, for that i find in ancient records this order or society is sometimes called salomon’s house.
 and sometimes the college of the six days works ;
whereby i am satisfied that our excellent king had learned from the hebrews that god had created the world and all that therein is within six days :
and therefore he instituting that house for the finding out of the true nature of all things, did give it also that second name.
but now to come to our present purpose
when the king had forbidden to all his people navigation into any part that was not under his crown, he made nevertheless this ordinance ;
that every twelve years there should be set forth, out of this kingdom two ships, appointed to several voyages ;
that in either of these ships there should be a mission of three of the fellows or brethren of salomon’s house ;
whose errand was only to give us knowledge of the affairs and state of those countries to which they were designed.
and especially of the sciences, arts, manufactures, and inventions of all the world ;
and withal to bring unto us books, instruments, and patterns in every kind :
that the ships, after they had landed the brethren, should return ;
and that the brethren should stay abroad till the new mission
these ships are not otherwise fraught, than with store of victuals, and good quantity of treasure to remain with the brethren.
the buying of such things and rewarding of such persons as they should think fit
now for me to tell you how the vulgar sort of mariners are contained from being discovered at land ;
and how they that must be put on shore for any time, color themselves under the names of other nations ;
and to what places these voyages have been designed ;
and what places of rendezvous are appointed for the new missions ;
and the like circumstances of the practique ;
i may not do it :
neither is it much to your desire
but thus you see we maintain a trade not for gold, silver, or jewels ;
nor for silks ;
nor for spices ;
nor any other commodity of matter ;
but only for god’s first creature, which was light :
to have light ( i say ) of the growth of all parts of the world
and when he had said this, he was silent ;
and so were we all
for indeed we were all astonished to hear so strange things so probably told
and he, perceiving that we were willing to say somewhat but had it not ready in great courtesy took us off.
he descended to ask us questions of our voyage and fortunes.
and in the end he concluded, that we might do well to think with ourselves what time of stay we would demand of the state ;
and bade us not to scant ourselves ;
for he would procure such time as we desired :
whereupon we all rose up, and presented ourselves to kiss the skirt of his tippet ;
but he would not suffer us ;
and so took his leave
but when it came once amongst our people that the state used to offer conditions to strangers that would stay.
we had work enough to get any of our men to look to our ship ;
and to keep them from going presently to the governor to crave conditions
but with much ado we refrained them, till we might agree what course to take.
we took ourselves now for free men, seeing there was no danger of our utter perdition ;
and lived most joyfully, going abroad and seeing what was to be seen in the city and places adjacent within our tedder ;
and obtaining acquaintance with many of the city, not of the meanest quality ;
at whose hands we found such humanity, and such a freedom and desire to take strangers as it were into their bosom.
as was enough to make us forget all that was dear to us in our own countries :
and continually we met with many things right worthy of observation and relation :
as indeed, if there be a mirror in the world worthy to hold men’s eyes, it is that country.
one day there were two of our company bidden to a feast of the family, as they call it
a most natural, pious, and reverend custom it is, shewing that nation to be compounded of all goodness
this is the manner of it
it is granted to any man that shall live to see thirty persons descended of his body alive together, to make this feast which is done at the cost of the state
the father of the family, whom they call the tirsan, two days before the feast, taketh to him three of such friends as he liketh to choose ;
and is assisted also by the governor of the city or place where the feast is celebrated ;
and all the persons of the family, of both sexes, are summoned to attend him
these two days the tirsan sitteth in consultation concerning the good estate of the family
there, if there be any discord or suits between any of the family, they are compounded and appeased
there, if any of the family be distressed or decayed, order is taken for their relief and competent means to live
there, if any be subject to vice, or take ill courses, they are reproved and censured
so likewise direction is given touching marriages, and the courses of life, which any of them should take, with divers other the like orders and advices
the governor assisteth, to the end to put in execution by his public authority the decrees and orders of the tirsan, if they should be disobeyed ;
though that seldom needeth ;
such reverence and obedience they give to the order of nature
the tirsan doth also then ever choose one man from among his sons, to live in house with him ;
who is called ever after the son of the vine
the reason will hereafter appear.
on the feast day, the father or tirsan cometh forth after divine service into a large room where the feast is celebrated ;
which room hath an half-pace at the upper end
against the wall, in the middle of the half-pace, is a chair placed for him, with a table and carpet before it
over the chair is a state, made round or oval, and it is of ivy ;
an ivy somewhat whiter than ours, like the leaf of a silver asp ;
but more shining ;
for it is green all winter
and the state is curiously wrought with silver and silk of divers colors, broiding or binding in the ivy ;
and is ever of the work of some of the daughters of the family ;
and veiled over at the top with a fine net of silk and silver
but the substance of it is true ivy ;
whereof, after it is taken down, the friends of the family are desirous to have some leaf or sprig to keep.
the tirsan cometh forth with all his generation or linage, the males before him, and the females following him ;
and if there be a mother from whose body the whole linage is descended.
there is a traverse placed in a loft above on the right hand of the chair.
where she sitteth, but is not seen
when the tirsan is come forth, he sitteth down in the chair ;
and all the linage place themselves against the wall, both at his back and upon the return of the half-pace, in order of their years without difference of sex ;
and stand upon their feet
when he is set ;
the room being always full of company, but well kept and without disorder ;
after some pause, there cometh in from the lower end of the room, a taratan and on either side of him two young lads ;
whereof one carrieth a scroll of their shining yellow parchment ;
and the other a cluster of grapes of gold, with a long foot or stalk
the herald and children are clothed with mantles of sea-water green satin ;
but the herald’s mantle is streamed with gold, and hath a train.
then the herald with three curtesies, or rather inclinations, cometh up as far as the half-pace ;
and there first taketh into his hand the scroll
this scroll is the king’s charter, containing gifts of revenew and many privileges granted to the father of the family ;
and is ever styled and directed, to such do one our well beloved friend and creditor :
which is a title proper only to this case
for they say the king is debtor to no man, but for propagation of his subjects
the seal set to the king’s charter is the king’s image, imbossed or moulded in gold ;
and though such charters be expedited of course, and as of right, yet they are varied by discretion, according to the number and dignity of the family
this charter the herald readeth aloud ;
and while it is read, the father or tirsan standeth up supported by two of his sons, such as he chooseth
then the herald mounteth the half-pace and delivereth the charter into his hand :
and with that there is an acclamation by all that are present in their language, which is thus much :
happy are the people of bensalem.
then the herald taketh into his hand from the other child the cluster of grapes, which is of gold, both the stalk and the grapes
but the grapes are daintily enamelled ;
and if the males of the family be the greater number, the grapes are enamelled purple, with a little sun set on the top ;
if the females, then they are enamelled into a greenish yellow, with a crescent on the top
the grapes are in number as many as there are descendants of the family
this golden cluster the herald delivereth also to the tirsan ;
who presently delivereth it over to that son that he had formerly chosen to be in house with him :
who beareth it before his father as an ensign of honour when he goeth in public, ever after ;
and is thereupon called the son of the vine.
after the ceremony endeth the father or tirsan retireth ;
and after some time cometh forth again to dinner, where he sitteth alone under the state, as before ;
and none of his descendants sit with him, of what degree or dignity soever, except he hap to be of salomon’s house
he is served only by his own children, such as are male ;
who perform unto him all service of the table upon the knee ;
and the women only stand about him, leaning against the wall
the room below the half-pace hath tables on the sides for the guests that are bidden ;
who are served with great and comely order ;
and towards the end of dinner there is an hymn sung, varied according to the invention of him that composeth it.
but the subject of it is always the praises of adam and noah and abraham ;
whereof the former two peopled the world, and the last was the father of the faithful :
concluding ever with a thanksgiving for the nativity of our saviour, in whose birth the births of all are only blessed.
dinner being done, the tirsan retireth again ;
and having withdrawn himself alone into a place, where he makes some private prayers, he cometh forth the third time, to give the blessing with all his descendants
then he calleth them forth by one and by one, by name, as he pleaseth, though seldom the order of age be inverted
the person that is called kneeleth down before the chair, and the father layeth his hand upon his head, or her head, and giveth the blessing in these words :
the man by whom thou hast breath and life speaketh the word :
the blessing of the everlasting father, the prince of peace, and the holy dove, be upon thee, and make the days of thy pilgrimage good and many
this he saith to every of them ;
and that done, if there be any of his sons of eminent merit and virtue, he calleth for them again ;
and saith, laying his arm over their shoulders, they standing ;
sons, it is well ye are born, give god the praise, and persevere to the end
and withall delivereth to either of them a jewel, made in the figure of an ear of wheat, which they ever after wear in the front of their turban or hat
this done, they fall to music and dances, and other recreations, after their manner, for the rest of the day
this is the full order of that feast.
by that time six or seven days were spent, i was fallen into straight acquaintance with a merchant of that city, whose name was joabin
he was a jew and circumcised :
for they have some few stirps of jews yet remaining among them, whom they leave to their own religion
which they may the better do, because they are of a far differing disposition from the jews in other parts
for whereas they hate the name of christ ;
and have a secret inbred rancour against the people among whom they live :
these ( contrariwise ) give unto our saviour many high attributes, and love the nation of bensalem extremely
surely this man of whom i speak would ever acknowledge that christ was born of a virgin and that he was more than a man ;
and he would tell how god made him ruler of the seraphims which guard his throne ;
and they call him also the milken way, and the eliah of the messiah ;
and many other high names ;
which though they be inferior to his divine majesty, yet they are far from the language of other jews.
and for the country of bensalem, this man would make no end of commending it ;
being desirous, by tradition among the jews there, to have it believed that the people thereof were of the generations of abraham, by another son, whom they call nachoran ;
and that moses by a secret cabala ordained the laws of bensalem which they now use ;
and that when the messiah should come, and sit in his throne at hierusalem, the king of bensalem should sit at his feet.
other kings should keep a great distance
but yet setting aside these jewish dreams, the man was a wise man, and learned, and of great policy, and excellently seen in the laws and customs of that nation.
amongst other discourses, one day i told him i was much affected with the relation i had ;
for that ( methought ) i had never heard of a solemnity wherein nature did so much preside
and because propagation of families proceedeth from the nuptial copulation, i desired to know of him what laws and customs they had concerning marriage ;
and whether they kept marriage well and whether they were tied to one wife ;
for that where population is so much affected,' and such as with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of plurality of wives.
to this he said, you have reason for to commend that excellent institution of the feast of the family
and indeed we have experience that those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast do flourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner
but hear me now, and i will tell you what i know
you shall understand that there is not under the heavens so chaste a nation as this of bensalem ;
nor so free from all pollution or foulness
it is the virgin of the world
i remember i have read in one of your european books, of an holy hermit amongst you that desired to see the spirit of fornication ;
and there appeared to him a little foul ugly aethiop
but if he had desired to see the spirit of chastity of bensalem, it would have appeared to him in the likeness of a fair beautiful cherubim
for there is nothing amongst mortal men more fair and admirable, than the chaste minds of this people
know therefore, that with them there are no stews, no dissolute houses, no courtesans, nor anything of that kind
nay they wonder ( with detestation ) at you in europe, which permit such things
they say ye have put marriage out of office :
for marriage is ordained a remedy for unlawful concupiscence ;
and natural concupiscence seemeth as a spar to marriage
but when men have at hand a remedy more agreeable to their corrupt will, marriage is almost expulsed
and therefore there are with you seen infinite men that marry not, but chose rather a libertine and impure single life, than to be yoked in marriage ;
and many that do marry, marry late, when the prime and strength of their years is past
and when they do marry, what is marriage to them but a very bargain ;
wherein is sought alliance, or portion, or reputation, with some desire ( almost indifferent ) of issue ;
and not the faithful nuptial union of man and wife, that was first instituted
neither is it possible that those that have cast away so basely so much of their strength, should greatly esteem children, as chaste men do
so likewise during marriage, is the case much amended, as it ought to be if those things were tolerated only for necessity ?
no, but they remain still as a very affront to marriage
the haunting of those dissolute places, or resort to courtesans, are no more punished in married men than in bachelors
and the depraved custom of change, and the delight in meretricious embracements, maketh marriage a dull thing, and a kind of imposition or tax
they hear you defend these things, as done to avoid greater evils ;
as advoutries, deflowering of virgins, unnatural lust, and the like
but they say this is a preposterous wisdom ;
and they call it lot’s offer, who to save his guests from abusing, offered his daughters :
nay they say farther that there is little gained in this ;
for that the same vices and appetites do still remain and abound ;
unlawful lust being like a furnace, that if you stop the flames altogether, it will quench ;
but if you give it any vent, it will rage
as for masculine love, they have no touch of it ;
and yet there are not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the world again as are there ;
and to speak generally, ( as i said before, ) i have not read of any such chastity, in any people as theirs
and their usual saying is, that whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself ;
and they say, that the reverence of a man’s self, is, next to religion, the chiefest bridle of all vices
god save the queen.

he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness
saith the lord.
these are the words of christ
and they teach us how far we must imitate his life and character
if we seek true illumination
and deliverance from all blindness of heart.
let it be our most earnest study
therefore to dwell upon the life of jesus christ.
his teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men
and such as have his spirit find therein the hidden manna.
but there are many who
though they frequently hear the gospel
yet feel but little longing after it
because they have not the mind of christ.
he therefore that will fully and with true wisdom understand the words of christ
let him strive to conform his whole life to that mind of christ.
what doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion concerning the holy trinity
if thou lack humility
and be thus displeasing to the trinity
for verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and upright
it is a good life which maketh a man dear to god.
i had rather feel contrition than be skilful in the definition thereof.
if thou knewest the whole bible
and the sayings of all the philosophers
what should all this profit thee without the love and grace of god
vanity of vanities, all is vanity, save to love god
and him only to serve.
that is the highest wisdom
to cast the world behind us
and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.
it is vanity then to seek after
and to trust in
the riches that shall perish.
it is vanity too to covet honours
and to lift up ourselves on high.
it is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them
for this shall bring misery at the last.
it is vanity to desire a long life
and to have little care for a good life.
it is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is
and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter.
it is vanity to love that which quickly passeth away
and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth.
be ofttimes mindful of the saying
the eye is not satisfied with seeing
nor the ear with hearing.
strive therefore to turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are seen
and to set it upon the things that are not seen.
for they who follow after their own fleshly lusts
defile the conscience and destroy the grace of god.
there is naturally in every man a desire to know
but what profiteth knowledge without the fear of god
better of a surety is a lowly peasant who serveth god
than a proud philosopher who watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.
he who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight
neither regardeth he the praises of men.
if i knew all the things that are in the world
and were not in charity what should it help me before god
who is to judge me according to my deeds ?
rest from inordinate desire of knowledge
for therein is found much distraction and deceit.
those who have knowledge desire to appear learned
and to be called wise.
many things there are to know which profiteth little or nothing to the soul.
and foolish out of measure is he who attendeth upon other things rather than those which serve to his soul’s health.
many words satisfy not the soul
but a good life refresheth the mind
and a pure conscience giveth great confidence towards god.
the greater and more complete thy knowledge
the more severely shalt thou be judged
unless thou hast lived holily.
therefore be not lifted up by any skill or knowledge that thou hast
but rather fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee.
if it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things
and understandest them well
know also that there are many more things which thou knowest not.
be not high-minded but rather confess thine ignorance.
why desirest thou to lift thyself above another
when there are found many more learned and more skilled in the scripture than thou
if thou wilt know and learn anything with profit
love to be thyself unknown and to be counted for nothing.
that is the highest and most profitable lesson
when a man truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.
to account nothing of one’s self
and to think always kindly and highly of others
this is great and perfect wisdom.
even shouldest thou see thy neighbor sin openly or grievously
yet thou oughtest not to reckon thyself better than he
for thou knowest not how long thou shalt keep thine integrity.
all of us are weak and frail
hold thou no man more frail than thyself.
of the knowledge of truth
happy is the man whom truth by itself doth teach
not by figures and transient words
but as it is in itself.
our own judgment and feelings often deceive us
and we discern but little of the truth.
what doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things
concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment
because we knew them not
oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and necessary
and to give our minds to things which are curious and hurtful
having eyes we see not.
and what have we to do with talk about genus and species
he to whom the eternal word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings.
from this one word are all things
and all things speak of him
and this is the beginning which also speaketh unto us.
no man without him understandeth or rightly judgeth.
the man to whom all things are one
who bringeth all things to one
who seeth all things in one
he is able to remain steadfast of spirit
and at rest in god.
o god who art the truth
make me one with thee in everlasting love.
it wearieth me oftentimes to read and listen to many things
in thee is all that i wish for and desire.
let all the doctors hold their peace
let all creation keep silence before thee
speak thou alone to me.
the more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself
the more things and the deeper things he understandeth
and that without labour
because he receiveth the light of understanding from above.
the spirit which is pure, sincere and steadfast
is not distracted though it hath many works to do
because it doth all things to the honour of god
and striveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking.
who is so full of hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart
a man who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the works which he hath to do abroad
and so is not drawn away by the desires of his evil will
but subjecteth everything to the judgment of right reason.
who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth for self-mastery
and this should be our endeavour
even to master self and thus daily to grow stronger than self
and go on unto perfection.
all perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life
and all our power of sight is not without some darkness.
a lowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to god than the deep searching of man’s learning.
not that learning is to be blamed
nor the taking account of anything that is good
but a good conscience and a holy life is better than all.
and because many seek knowledge rather than good living
therefore they go astray and bear little or no fruit.
o if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings
there had not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity
nor such ill living among houses of religion.
of a surety at the day of judgment it will be demanded of us
not what we have read, but what we have done
not how well we have spoken
but how holily we have lived.
tell me where now are all those masters and teachers
whom thou knewest well, whilst they were yet with you
and flourished in learning
their stalls are now filled by others
who perhaps never have one thought concerning them.
whilst they lived they seemed to be somewhat
but now no one speaks of them.
oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away
would that their life and knowledge had agreed together
for then would they have read and inquired unto good purpose.
how many perish through empty learning in this world
who care little for serving god.
and because they love to be great more than to be humble
therefore they have become vain in their imaginations
he only is truly great, who hath great charity.
he is truly great who deemeth himself small
and counteth all height of honour as nothing.
he is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly things as dung that he may win christ.
and he is the truly learned man, who doeth the will of god
and forsaketh his own will.
chapter iv
of prudence in action
we must not trust every word of others or feeling within ourselves
but cautiously and patiently try the matter
whether it be of god.
unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier to believe and speak evil of others
rather than good.
but they that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer
for they know man’s weakness that it is prone to evil and unstable in words.
this is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action
or stubborn in our own opinions.
a part of this wisdom also is not to believe every word we hear
nor to tell others all that we hear
even though we believe it.
take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience
and seek to be instructed by one better than thyself
rather than to follow thine own inventions.
a good life maketh a man wise toward god
and giveth him experience in many things.
the more humble a man is in himself
and the more obedient towards god
the wiser will he be in all things
and the more shall his soul be at peace.
chapter v
of the reading of holy scriptures
it is truth which we must look for in holy writ
not cunning of words.
all scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it was written.
we must rather seek for what is profitable in scripture
than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse.
therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple
as well as those which are deep and difficult.
and let not the weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee
whether he be of little or much learning
but let the love of the pure truth draw thee to read.
ask not who hath said this or that
but look to what he says.
men pass away, but the truth of the lord endureth for ever.
without respect of persons god speaketh to us in divers manners.
our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading of holy writings
when we seek to understand and discuss
where we should pass simply on.
if thou wouldst profit by thy reading
read humbly, simply, honestly
and not desiring to win a character for learning.
ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men
nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou
for they are not uttered without cause.
chapter vi
of inordinate affections
whensoever a man desireth aught above measure
immediately he becometh restless.
the proud and the avaricious man are never at rest
while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the multitude of peace.
the man who is not yet wholly dead to self
is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters.
it is hard for him who is weak in spirit
and still in part carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense
to withdraw himself altogether from earthly desires.
and therefore, when he withdraweth himself from these
he is often sad, and easily angered too if any oppose his will.
but if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination
immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his conscience
for that he hath followed his own desire
and yet in no way attained the peace which he hoped for.
for true peace of heart is to be found in resisting passion
not in yielding to it.
and therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is carnal
nor in him who is given up to the things that are without him
but only in him who is fervent towards god and living the life of the spirit.
chapter vii
of fleeing from vain hope and pride
vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in any created thing.
be not ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of jesus christ
and to be reckoned poor in this life.
rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in god.
do what lieth in thy power
and god will help thy good intent.
trust not in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives
but rather trust in the favour of god
who resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.
boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them
nor in thy friends if they be powerful
but in god, who giveth all things
and in addition to all things desireth to give even himself.
be not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body
for with only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.
be not vain of thy skilfulness or ability
lest thou displease god
from whom cometh every good gift which we have.
count not thyself better than others
lest perchance thou appear worse in the sight of god
who knoweth what is in man.
be not proud of thy good works
for god’s judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man
and what pleaseth man is ofttimes displeasing to him.
if thou hast any good
believe that others have more
and so thou mayest preserve thy humility.
it is no harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others
but it is great harm if thou place thyself above even one.
peace is ever with the humble man
but in the heart of the proud there is envy and continual wrath.
chapter viii
of the danger of too much familiarity
open not thine heart to every man
but deal with one who is wise and feareth god.
be seldom with the young and with strangers.
be not a flatterer of the rich
nor willingly seek the society of the great.
let thy company be the humble and the simple
the devout and the gentle
and let thy discourse be concerning things which edify.
be not familiar with any woman
but commend all good women alike unto god.
choose for thy companions god and his angels only
and flee from the notice of men.
we must love all men, but not make close companions of all.
it sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us is highly regarded through good report of him
whose actual person is nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it.
we sometimes think to please others by our intimacy
and forthwith displease them the more by the faultiness of character which they perceive in us.
chapter ix
of obedience and subjection
it is verily a great thing to live in obedience
to be under authority and not to be at our own disposal.
far safer is it to live in subjection than in a place of authority.
many are in obedience from necessity rather than from love
these take it amiss, and repine for small cause.
nor will they gain freedom of spirit
unless with all their heart they submit themselves for the love of god.
though thou run hither and thither
thou wilt not find peace
save in humble subjection to the authority of him who is set over thee.
fancies about places and change of them have deceived many.
true it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent
and is the more inclined to those who agree with him.
but if christ is amongst us
then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace.
who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things
therefore trust not too much to thine own opinion
but be ready also to hear the opinions of others.
though thine own opinion be good
yet if for the love of god thou foregoest it
and followest that of another
thou shalt the more profit thereby.
ofttimes i have heard that it is safer to hearken and to receive counsel than to give it.
it may also come to pass that each opinion may be good
but to refuse to hearken to others when reason or occasion requireth it
is a mark of pride or wilfulness.
chapter x
of the danger of superfluity of words
avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of men
for talk concerning worldly things
though it be innocently undertaken, is a hindrance
so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity.
many a time i wish that i had held my peace
and had not gone amongst men.
but why do we talk and gossip so continually
seeing that we so rarely resume our silence without some hurt done to our conscience
we like talking so much because we hope by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort
and because we seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts.
and we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or desire
or else of those which we most dislike.
but alas, it is often to no purpose and in vain.
for this outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner comfort which cometh from god.
therefore must we watch and pray that time pass not idly away.
if it be right and desirable for thee to speak
speak things which are to edification.
evil custom and neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of watching over our lips.
nevertheless, devout conversation on spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress
most of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground of fellowship in god.
chapter xi
of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress
we may enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying ourselves with the sayings and doings of others
and things which concern not ourselves.
how can he abide long time in peace who occupieth himself with other men’s matters
and with things without himself
and meanwhile payeth little or rare heed to the self within
blessed are the single-hearted
for they shall have abundance of peace.
how came it to pass that many of the saints were so perfect
so contemplative of divine things
because they steadfastly sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires
and so were enabled to cling with their whole heart to god
and be free and at leisure for the thought of him.
we are too much occupied with our own affections
and too anxious about transitory things.
seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault
nor are we zealous for daily growth in grace.
and so we remain lukewarm and unspiritual.
were we fully watchful of ourselves
and not bound in spirit to outward things
then might we be wise unto salvation
and make progress in divine contemplation.
our great and grievous stumbling-block is that
not being freed from our affections and desires
we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the saints.
and when even a little trouble befalleth us
too quickly are we cast down
and fly to the world to give us comfort.
if we would quit ourselves like men
and strive to stand firm in the battle
then should we see the lord helping us from heaven.
for he himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who trust in him
yea, he provideth for us occasions of striving
to the end that we may win the victory.
if we look upon our progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances and forms
our devoutness will soon come to an end.
but let us lay the axe to the very root of our life
that being cleansed from affections
we may possess our souls in peace.
if each year should see one fault rooted out from us
we should go quickly on to perfection.
but on the contrary
we often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our conversion than after many years of profession.
zeal and progress ought to increase day by day
yet now it seemeth a great thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour.
if we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning
then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and joy.
it is a hard thing to break through a habit
and a yet harder thing to go contrary to our own will.
yet if thou overcome not slight and easy obstacles
how shalt thou overcome greater ones
withstand thy will at the beginning
and unlearn an evil habit
lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties.
oh, if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring to thyself
and what joy to others
methinketh thou wouldst be more zealous for spiritual profit.
chapter xii
of the uses of adversity
it is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities
for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger and sojourner
and may not put his trust in any worldly thing.
it is good that we sometimes endure contradictions
and are hardly and unfairly judged
when we do and mean what is good.
for these things help us to be humble
and shield us from vain-glory.
for then we seek the more earnestly the witness of god
when men speak evil of us falsely
and give us no credit for good.
therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon god
so that he needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men.
when a man who feareth god is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts
then he seeth that god is the more necessary unto him
since without god he can do no good thing.
then he is heavy of heart
he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of his heart.
then he groweth weary of life
and would fain depart and be with christ.
by all this he is taught that in the world there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace.
chapter xiii
of resisting temptation
so long as we live in the world
we cannot be without trouble and trial.
wherefore it is written in job
the life of man upon the earth is a trial.
and therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning trials and temptations
and watch unto prayer
lest the devil find occasion to deceive
for he never sleepeth
but goeth about seeking whom he may devour.
no man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never temptations
nor can we ever be wholly free from them.
yet, notwithstanding
temptations turn greatly unto our profit
even though they be great and hard to bear
for through them we are humbled, purified, instructed.
all saints have passed through much tribulation and temptation
and have profited thereby.
and they who endured not temptation became reprobate and fell away.
there is no position so sacred
no place so secret
that it is without temptations and adversities.
there is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he liveth
because we have the root of temptation within ourselves
in that we are born in concupiscence.
one temptation or sorrow passeth
and another cometh
and always we shall have somewhat to suffer
for we have fallen from perfect happiness.
many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into them.
by flight alone we cannot overcome
but by endurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.
he who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root
shall profit little
nay, rather temptations will return to him the more quickly
and will be the more terrible.
little by little, through patience and long-suffering
thou shalt conquer by the help of god
rather than by violence and thine own strength of will.
in the midst of temptation often seek counsel
and deal not hardly with one who is tempted
but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself.
the beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper and want of trust in god
for even as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves
so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose tempted
now on this side, now on that.
as fire testeth iron
so doth temptation the upright man.
oftentimes we know not what strength we have
but temptation revealeth to us what we are.
nevertheless, we must watch
especially in the beginnings of temptation
for then is the foe the more easily mastered
when he is not suffered to enter within the mind
but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked.
wherefore one saith,
check the beginnings
once thou mightest have cured,
but now ’tis past thy skill
too long hath it endured.
for first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion
then the strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent.
and so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether
because he was not resisted at the beginning.
and the longer a man delayeth his resistance
the weaker he groweth
and the stronger groweth the enemy against him.
some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning of their conversion
some at the end.
some are sorely tried their whole life long.
some there are who are tempted but lightly
according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of god
who knoweth the character and circumstances of men
and ordereth all things for the welfare of his elect.
therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted
but the more fervently should cry unto god
that he will vouchsafe to help us in all our tribulation
and that he will, as st. paul saith.
with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it.
let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god in all temptation and trouble
for he will save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit.
in temptations and troubles a man is proved
what progress he hath made
and therein is his reward the greater
and his virtue doth the more appear.
nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction
but if he behave himself patiently in the time of adversity
then is there hope of great progress.
some are kept safe from great temptations
but are overtaken in those which are little and common
that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to themselves in great things
being weak in small things.
chapter xiv
on avoiding rash judgment
look well unto thyself
and beware that thou judge not the doings of others.
in judging others a man laboureth in vain
he often erreth, and easily falleth into sin
but in judging and examining himself he always laboureth to good purpose.
according as a matter toucheth our fancy
so oftentimes do we judge of it
for easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal feeling.
if god were always the sole object of our desire
we should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our fancy.
but often some secret thought lurking within us
or even some outward circumstance
turneth us aside.
many are secretly seeking their own ends in what they do
yet know it not.
they seem to live in good peace of mind so long as things go well with them
and according to their desires
but if their desires be frustrated and broken
immediately they are shaken and displeased.
diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings about dissensions between friends
between countrymen, between religious and godly men.
established custom is not easily relinquished
and no man is very easily led to see with the eyes of another.
if thou rest more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of jesus christ
thy light shall come slowly and hardly
for god willeth us to be perfectly subject unto himself
and all our reason to be exalted by abundant love towards him.
chapter xv
of works of charity
for no worldly good whatsoever
and for the love of no man
must anything be done which is evil
but for the help of the suffering a good work must sometimes be postponed
or be changed for a better
for herein a good work is not destroyed
but improved.
without charity no work profiteth
but whatsoever is done in charity
however small and of no reputation it be
bringeth forth good fruit
for god verily considereth what a man is able to do
more than the greatness of what he doth.
he doth much who loveth much.
he doth much who doth well.
he doth well who ministereth to the public good rather than to his own.
oftentimes that seemeth to be charity which is rather carnality
because it springeth from natural inclination, self-will, hope of repayment, desire of gain.
he who hath true and perfect charity
in no wise seeketh his own good
but desireth that god alone be altogether glorified.
he envieth none
because he longeth for no selfish joy
nor doth he desire to rejoice in himself
but longeth to be blessed in god as the highest good.
he ascribeth good to none save to god only
the fountain whence all good proceedeth, and the end, the peace, the joy of all saints.
oh, he who hath but a spark of true charity
hath verily learned that all worldly things are full of vanity.
chapter xvi
of bearing with the faults of others
those things which a man cannot amend in himself or in others
he ought patiently to bear
until god shall otherwise ordain.
bethink thee that perhaps it is better for thy trial and patience
without which our merits are but little worth.
nevertheless thou oughtest
when thou findeth such impediments
to beseech god that he would vouchsafe to sustain thee
that thou be able to bear them with a good will.
if one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken
strive not with him, but commit all to god
that his will may be done and his honour be shown in his servants
for he knoweth well how to convert the evil unto good.
endeavour to be patient in bearing with other men’s faults and infirmities whatsoever they be
for thou thyself also hast many things which have need to be borne with by others.
if thou canst not make thine own self what thou desireth
how shalt thou be able to fashion another to thine own liking.
we are ready to see others made perfect
and yet we do not amend our own shortcomings.
we will that others be straitly corrected
but we will not be corrected ourselves.
the freedom of others displeaseth us
but we are dissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us.
we desire rules to be made restraining others
but by no means will we suffer ourselves to be restrained.
thus therefore doth it plainly appear how seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same balance with ourselves.
if all men were perfect
what then should we have to suffer from others for god ?
but now hath god thus ordained
that we may learn to bear one another’s burdens
because none is without defect
none without a burden
none sufficient of himself
none wise enough of himself
but it behoveth us to bear with one another
to comfort one another, to help, instruct, admonish one another.
how much strength each man hath is best proved by occasions of adversity
for such occasions do not make a man frail
but show of what temper he is.
chapter xvii
of a religious life
it behoveth thee to learn to mortify thyself in many things
if thou wilt live in amity and concord with other men.
it is no small thing to dwell in a religious community or congregation
and to live there without complaint
and therein to remain faithful even unto death.
blessed is he who hath lived a good life in such a body
and brought it to a happy end.
if thou wilt stand fast and wilt profit as thou oughtest
hold thyself as an exile and a pilgrim upon the earth.
thou wilt have to be counted as a fool for christ
if thou wilt lead a religious life.
the clothing and outward appearance are of small account
it is change of character and entire mortification of the affections which make a truly religious man.
he who seeketh aught save god and the health of his soul
shall find only tribulation and sorrow.
nor can he stand long in peace
who striveth not to be least of all and servant of all.
thou art called to endure and to labour
not to a life of ease and trifling talk.
here therefore are men tried as gold in the furnace.
no man can stand
unless with all his heart he will humble himself for god’s sake.
chapter xviii
of the example of the holy fathers
consider now the lively examples of the holy fathers
in whom shone forth real perfectness and religion
and thou shalt see how little
even as nothing, is all that we do.
ah, what is our life when compared to theirs
they, saints and friends of christ as they were
served the lord in hunger and thirst
in cold and nakedness
in labour and weariness
in watchings and fastings
in prayer and holy meditations
in persecutions and much rebuke.
o how many and grievous tribulations did the apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins endure
and all others who would walk in the footsteps of christ.
for they hated their souls in this world that they might keep them unto life eternal.
o how strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert
what long and grievous temptations they did suffer
how often were they assaulted by the enemy
what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto god
what strict fasts did they endure
what fervent zeal and desire after spiritual profit did they manifest
how bravely did they fight that their vices might not gain the mastery
how entirely and steadfastly did they reach after god
by day they laboured
and at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer
yea, even when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer.
they spent their whole time profitably
every hour seemed short for retirement with god
and through the great sweetness of contemplation
even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten.
they renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen
they desired nothing from the world
they ate the bare necessaries of life
they were unwilling to minister to the body even in necessity.
thus were they poor in earthly things
but rich above measure in grace and virtue.
though poor to the outer eye
within they were filled with grace and heavenly benedictions.
they were strangers to the world
but unto god they were as kinsmen and friends.
they seemed unto themselves as of no reputation
and in the world’s eyes contemptible
but in the sight of god they were precious and beloved.
they stood fast in true humility
they lived in simple obedience
they walked in love and patience
and thus they waxed strong in spirit
and obtained great favour before god.
to all religious men they were given as an example
and they ought more to provoke us unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to carelessness of life.
o how great was the love of all religious persons at the beginning of this sacred institution
o what devoutness of prayer
what rivalry in holiness
what strict discipline was observed
what reverence and obedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things
the traces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men
who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot.
now a man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor
and if he can only endure with patience what he hath undertaken.
o the coldness and negligence of our times
that we so quickly decline from the former love
and it is become a weariness to live
because of sloth and lukewarmness.
may progress in holiness not wholly fall asleep in thee
who many times hast seen so many examples of devout men
chapter xix
of the exercises of a religious man
the life of a christian ought to be adorned with all virtues
that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men.
and verily it should be yet better within than without
for god is a discerner of our heart
whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we are
and walk pure in his presence as do the angels.
we ought daily to renew our vows
and to kindle our hearts to zeal
as if each day were the first day of our conversion
and to say, help me, o god
in my good resolutions
and in thy holy service
and grant that this day i may make a good beginning
for hitherto i have done nothing
according to our resolution so is the rate of our progress
and much diligence is needful for him who would make good progress.
for if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short
how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly
but manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution
yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made without some loss to us.
the resolution of the righteous dependeth more upon the grace of god than upon their own wisdom
for in him they always put their trust
whatsoever they take in hand.
for man proposeth
but god disposeth
and the way of a man is not in himself.
if a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act of piety
or of some brotherly kindness
it can easily be taken up afterwards
but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness
then is it sinful
and the mischief will be felt.
strive as earnestly as we may
we shall still fall short in many things.
always should some distinct resolution be made by us
and, most of all
we must strive against those sins which most easily beset us.
both our outer and inner life should be straitly examined and ruled by us
because both have to do with our progress.
if thou canst not be always examining thyself
thou canst at certain seasons
and at least twice in the day
at evening and at morning.
in the morning make thy resolves
and in the evening inquire into thy life
how thou hast sped to-day in word
deed and thought
for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended god and thy neighbour.
gird up thy lions like a man against the assaults of the devil
bridle thine appetite
and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh.
be thou never without something to do
be reading, or writing, or praying, or meditating
or doing something that is useful to the community.
bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion
nor are they to be used by all alike.
the duties which are not common to all must not be done openly
but are safest carried on in secret.
but take heed that thou be not careless in the common duties
and more devout in the secret
but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie upon thee
then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure
give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee.
all cannot have one exercise
but one suiteth better to this man and another to that.
even for the diversity of season different exercises are needed
some suit better for feasts, some for fasts.
we need one kind in time of temptations and others in time of peace and quietness.
some are suitable to our times of sadness
and others when we are joyful in the lord.
when we draw near the time of the great feasts
good exercises should be renewed
and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought.
we ought to make our resolutions from one feast to another
as if each were the period of our departure from this world
and of entering into the eternal feast.
so ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons
and the more solemnly to live
and to keep straightest watch upon each holy observance
as though we were soon to receive the reward of our labours at the hand of god.
and if this be deferred
let us believe ourselves to be as yet ill-prepared
and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed in us at the appointed season
and let us study to prepare ourselves the better for our end.
blessed is that servant
as the evangelist luke hath it
whom when the lord cometh he shall find watching.
verily i say unto you he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
chapter xx
of the love of solitude and silence
seek a suitable time for thy meditation
and think frequently of the mercies of god to thee.
leave curious questions.
study such matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement.
if thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about
as well as from novelties and gossip
thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt for good meditation.
the greatest saints used to avoid as far as they could the company of men
and chose to live in secret with god.
one hath said
as oft as i have gone among men
so oft have i returned less a man
this is what we often experience when we have been long time in conversation.
for it is easier to be altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word.
it is easier to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors.
he, therefore,
that seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual
must go with jesus apart from the multitude
no man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at home.
no man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace.
no man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject.
no man safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.
no man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good conscience within himself.
the boldness of the saints was always full of the fear of god.
nor were they the less earnest and humble in themselves
because they shone forth with great virtues and grace.
but the boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption
and at the last turneth to their own confusion.
never promise thyself security in this life
howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.
often those who stand highest in the esteem of men
fall the more grievously because of their over great confidence.
wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation
but should be frequently assaulted
lest they be over confident
lest they be indeed lifted up into pride
or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the world.
o how good a conscience should that man keep
who never sought a joy that passeth away
who never became entangled with the world
o how great peace and quiet should he possess
who would cast off all vain care
and think only of healthful and divine things
and build his whole hope upon god
no man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath diligently exercised himself in holy compunction.
if thou wilt feel compunction within thy heart
enter into thy chamber and shut out the tumults of the world
as it is written
commune with your own heart in your own chamber and be still.
in retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad.
retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet
but if thou keep not in it
begetteth weariness.
if in the beginning of thy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well
it shall afterwards be to thee a dear friend
and a most pleasant solace.
in silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth the hidden things of the scriptures.
therein findeth she a fountain of tears
wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night
that she may grow the more dear to her maker as she dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction.
to him who withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends god with his holy angels will draw nigh.
it is better to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders.
it is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad
to fly from being seen
to have no desire to see men.
why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have
the world passeth away and the lust thereof.
the desires of sensuality draw thee abroad
but when an hour is past
what dost thou bring home
but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart
a merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return
and a merry evening maketh a sad morning
so doth all carnal joy begin pleasantly
but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth.
what canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home
behold the heaven and the earth and the elements
for out of these are all things made.
what canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun
thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied
but thou wilt never be able to attain unto this.
if thou shouldest see all things before thee at once
what would it be but a vain vision
lift up thine eyes to god on high
and pray that thy sins and negligences may be forgiven.
leave vain things to vain men
and mind thou the things which god hath commanded thee.
shut thy door upon thee
and call unto thyself jesus thy beloved.
remain with him in thy chamber
for thou shalt not elsewhere find so great peace.
if thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to vain talk
thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.
but because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things
thou must therefore suffer trouble of heart.
chapter xxi
of compunction of heart
if thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of god
and long not to be too free
but restrain all thy senses under discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth.
give thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion.
compunction openeth the way for many good things
which dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose.
it is wonderful that any man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and weigheth his banishment
and the manifold dangers which beset his soul.
through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we feel not the sorrows of our soul
but often vainly laugh when we have good cause to weep.
there is no true liberty nor real joy
save in the fear of god with a good conscience.
happy is he who can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the one purpose of holy compunction.
happy is he who putteth away from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience.
strive manfully, custom is overcome by custom.
if thou knowest how to let men alone
they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own works.
busy not thyself with the affairs of others
nor entangle thyself with the business of great men.
keep always thine eye upon thyself first of all
and give advice to thyself specially before all thy dearest friends.
if thou hast not the favour of men
be not thereby cast down
but let thy concern be that thou holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly
as becometh a servant of god and a devout monk.
it is often better and safer for a man not to have many comforts in this life
especially those which concern the flesh.
but that we lack divine comforts or feel them rarely is to our own blame
because we seek not compunction of heart
nor utterly cast away those comforts which are vain and worldly.
know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation
and worthy rather of much tribulation.
when a man hath perfect compunction
then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him.
a good man will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping
for whether he considereth himself
or pondereth concerning his neighbour
he knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation
and the more thoroughly he considereth himself
the more thoroughly he grieveth.
grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our sins and vices
wherein we lie so entangled that we are but seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.
if thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy life should be
thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to improve.
and if thou didst seriously consider the future pains of hell
i believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain and fear not discipline.
but because these things reach not the heart
and we still love pleasant things
therefore we remain cold and miserably indifferent.
oftentimes it is from poverty of spirit that the wretched body is so easily led to complain.
pray therefore humbly unto the lord that he will give thee the spirit of compunction and say in the language of the prophet
feed me, o lord, with bread of tears
and give me plenteousness of tears to drink.
on the contemplation of human misery
thou art miserable wheresoever thou art
and whithersoever thou turnest
unless thou turn thee to god.
why art thou disquieted because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and desires
who is he that hath everything according to his will
neither i, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth.
there is no man in the world free from trouble or anguish
though he were king or pope.
who is he who hath the happiest lot
even he who is strong to suffer somewhat for god.
there are many foolish and unstable men who say
see what a prosperous life that man hath
how rich and how great he is, how powerful, how exalted
but lift up thine eyes to the good things of heaven
and thou shalt see that all these worldly things are nothing
they are utterly uncertain
yea, they are wearisome
because they are never possessed without care and fear.
the happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him.
our life upon the earth is verily wretchedness.
the more a man desireth to be spiritual
the more bitter doth the present life become to him
because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of human corruption.
for to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to rest, to labour
and to be subject to the other necessities of nature
is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout man
who would fain be released and free from all sin.
for the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of the body in this world.
wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth to be freed from them
saying, deliver me from my necessities, o lord.
but woe to those who know not their own misery
and yet greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible life.
for to such a degree do some cling to it even though by labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for subsistence that if they might live here always
they would care nothing for the kingdom of god.
oh foolish and faithless of heart
who lie buried so deep in worldly things
that they relish nothing save the things of the flesh
miserable ones, they will too sadly find out at the last
how vile and worthless was that which they loved.
the saints of god and all loyal friends of christ held as nothing the things which pleased the flesh
or those which flourished in this life
but their whole hope and affection aspired to the things which are above.
their whole desire was borne upwards to everlasting and invisible things
lest they should be drawn downwards by the love of things visible.
lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things spiritual.
there is yet time, the hour is not past.
why wilt thou put off thy resolution
arise, begin this very moment, and say
now is the time to do
now is the time to fight
now is the proper time for amendment
when thou art ill at ease and troubled
then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing.
thou must go through fire and water that god may bring thee into a wealthy place.
unless thou put force upon thyself
thou wilt not conquer thy faults.
so long as we carry about with us this frail body
we cannot be without sin
we cannot live without weariness and trouble.
gladly would we have rest from all misery
but because through sin we have lost innocence
we have lost also the true happiness.
therefore must we be patient
and wait for the mercy of god
until this tyranny be overpast
and this mortality be swallowed up of life.
o how great is the frailty of man
which is ever prone to evil
to-day thou confessest thy sins
and to-morrow thou committest again the sins thou didst confess.
now dost thou resolve to avoid a fault
and within an hour thou behavest thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all.
good cause have we therefore to humble ourselves
and never to think highly of ourselves
seeing that we are so frail and unstable.
and quickly may that be lost by our negligence
which by much labour was hardly attained through grace.
what shall become of us at the end
if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle
woe unto us, if we choose to rest
as though it were a time of peace and security
while as yet no sign appeareth in our life of true holiness.
rather had we need that we might begin yet afresh
like good novices
to be instructed unto good living
if haply there might be hope of some future amendment and greater spiritual increase.
of meditation upon death
very quickly will there be an end of thee here
take heed therefore how it will be with thee in another world.
to-day man is, and tomorrow he will be seen no more.
and being removed out of sight
quickly also he is out of mind.
o the dulness and hardness of man’s heart
which thinketh only of the present
and looketh not forward to the future.
thou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself
as if thou wert to die this day.
if thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear death.
it were better for thee to watch against sin
than to fly from death.
if to-day thou art not ready
how shalt thou be ready to-morrow
to-morrow is an uncertain day
and how knowest thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow ?
what doth it profit to live long
when we amend so little
ah, long life doth not always amend
but often the more increaseth guilt.
oh that we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent
many there are who reckon the years since they were converted
and yet oftentimes how little is the fruit thereof.
if it is a fearful thing to die
it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.
happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes
and daily prepareth himself to die.
if thou hast ever seen one die
consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.
when it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see the evening
and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the morrow.
always be thou prepared
and so live that death may never find thee unprepared.
many die suddenly and unexpectedly.
for at such an hour as ye think not
the son of man cometh.
when that last hour shall come
thou wilt begin to think very differently of thy whole life past
and wilt mourn bitterly that thou hast been so negligent and slothful.
happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he would fain be found in death
for a perfect contempt of the world
a fervent desire to excel in virtue
the love of discipline
the painfulness of repentance
readiness to obey, denial of self
submission to any adversity for love of christ
these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy death.
whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of good works
but when thou art in sickness i know not how much thou wilt be able to do.
few are made better by infirmity
even as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy.
trust not thy friends and kinsfolk
nor put off the work of thy salvation to the future
for men will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest.
it is better for thee now to provide in time
and to send some good before thee
than to trust to the help of others.
if thou art not anxious for thyself now
who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards
now the time is most precious.
now is the accepted time
now is the day of salvation.
but alas, that thou spendest not well this time
wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly.
the hour will come when thou shalt desire one day
yea, one hour, for amendment of life
and i know not whether thou shalt obtain.
oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself
from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear
and in expectation of death
strive now to live in such wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear.
learn now to die to the world
so shalt thou begin to live with christ.
learn now to contemn all earthly things
and then mayest thou freely go unto christ.
keep under thy body by penitence
and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence.
ah, foolish one, why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long
when thou art not sure of a single day
how many have been deceived
and suddenly have been snatched away from the body
how many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword
another was drowned
another falling from on high broke his neck
another died at the table
another whilst at play
one died by fire
another by the sword
another by the pestilence
another by the robber.
thus cometh death to all
and the life of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow.
who will remember thee after thy death
and who will entreat for thee
work, work now, oh dearly beloved
work all that thou canst.
for thou knowest not when thou shalt die
nor what shall happen unto thee after death.
while thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches.
think of nought but of thy salvation
care only for the things of god.
make to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of god and walking in their steps
that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting habitations.
keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth
to whom the things of the world appertain not.
keep thine heart free, and lifted up towards god
for here have we no continuing city.
to him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears
that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death unto its lord.
chapter xxiv
of the judgment and punishment of the wicked
in all that thou doest, remember the end
and how thou wilt stand before a strict judge
from whom nothing is hid
who is not bribed with gifts
nor accepteth excuses
but will judge righteous judgment.
o most miserable and foolish sinner
who art sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man
what wilt thou answer to god
who knoweth all thy misdeeds
why dost thou not provide for thyself against the day of judgment
when no man shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another
but each one shall bear his burden himself alone
now doth thy labour bring forth fruit
now is thy weeping acceptable
thy groaning heard
thy sorrow well pleasing to god
and cleansing to thy soul.
even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of purifying his soul.
when suffering injuries he grieveth more for the other’s malice than for his own wrong
when he prayeth heartily for those that despitefully use him
and forgiveth them from his heart
when he is not slow to ask pardon from others
when he is swifter to pity than to anger
when he frequently denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to the spirit.
better is it now to purify the soul from sin
than to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter.
truly we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards the flesh.
what is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins
the more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh
the more heavy shall thy punishment be
and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning.
for wherein a man hath sinned
therein shall he be the more heavily punished.
there shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning goads
and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst.
there shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and stinking brimstone
and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for very grief.
no sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own proper punishment.
the proud shall be filled with utter confusion
and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty.
an hour’s pain there shall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.
no quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost
though here sometimes there is respite from pain
and enjoyment of the solace of friends.
be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins
that in the day of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.
for then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his labours.
then shall he stand up to judge
he who now submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.
then shall the poor and humble man have great confidence
while the proud is taken with fear on every side.
then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who learned to be a fool and despised for christ.
then shall all tribulation patiently borne delight us
while the mouth of the ungodly shall be stopped.
then shall every godly man rejoice
and every profane man shall mourn.
then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in delights.
then the humble garment shall put on beauty
and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile.
then the little poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.
then enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the world.
then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all worldly wisdom.
then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned philosophy.
then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.
then shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously.
then thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having made long speech.
then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.
then a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all earthly delight.
learn now to suffer a little
that then thou mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.
prove first here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.
if now thou art able to bear so little
how wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments
if now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient
what shall hell-fire do then
behold of a surety thou art not able to have two paradises
to take thy fill or delight here in this world
and to reign with christ hereafter.
if even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and pleasures
what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee in an instant
all therefore is vanity
save to love god and to serve him only.
for he who loveth god with all his heart feareth not death
nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell
because perfect love giveth sure access to god.
but he who still delighteth in sin
no marvel if he is afraid of death and judgment.
nevertheless it is a good thing
if love as yet cannot restrain thee from evil
that at least the fear of hell should hold thee back.
but he who putteth aside the fear of god cannot long continue in good
but shall quickly fall into the snares of the devil.
chapter xxv
of the zealous amendment of our whole life
be thou watchful and diligent in god’s service
and bethink thee often why thou hast renounced the world.
was it not that thou mightest live to god and become a spiritual man
be zealous, therefore
for thy spiritual profit
for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy labours
and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy borders.
now shalt thou labour a little
and thou shalt find great rest
yea everlasting joy.
if thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour
doubt not that god shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee.
it is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory
but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or lifted up.
a certain man being in anxiety of mind
continually tossed about between hope and fear
and being on a certain day overwhelmed with grief
cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church
and meditated within himself
saying, oh, if i but knew that i should still persevere
and presently heard within him a voice from god
and if thou didst know it
what wouldst thou do
do now what thou wouldst do then
and thou shalt be very secure
and straightway being comforted and strengthened
he committed himself to the will of god and the perturbation of spirit ceased
neither had he a mind any more to search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter
but studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of god
for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.
hope in the lord and be doing good
saith the prophet
dwell in the land and thou shalt be fed with its riches.
one thing there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment
even the dread of difficulty
or the labour of the conflict.
nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most grievous and contrary to them
for there a man profiteth most and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and mortifieth himself in spirit.
but all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify
yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit
although he have stronger passions
than another who is more temperate of disposition
but is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue.
two things specially avail unto improvement in holiness
namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined
and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking.
and strive also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which displease thee most frequently in others.
gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art
and wherever thou seest or hearest good examples
stir thyself to follow them
but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy
take heed that thou do not the same
or if at any time thou hast done it
strive quickly to amend thyself.
as thine eye observeth others
so again are the eyes of others upon thee.
how sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of good discipline
and how sad is it and grievous to see them walking disorderly
not practising the duties to which they are called.
how hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their calling
and turn their inclinations to things which are none of their business.
be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken
and set always before thee the remembrance of the crucified.
truly oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of jesus christ
because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto him
though thou hast been a long time in the way of god.
a religious man who exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our lord shall find there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for him
neither is there need that he shall seek anything better beyond jesus.
oh, if jesus crucified would come into our hearts
how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we need to know
he who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are laid upon him.
he who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon trouble
and suffereth anguish upon every side
because he is without inward consolation
and is forbidden to seek that which is outward.
he who is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin.
he who seeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress
because one thing or another will give him displeasure.
if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the lord our god with our whole heart and voice
if thou never hadst need to eat or drink, or sleep
but wert always able to praise god
and to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone
then shouldst thou be far happier than now
when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh.
that these necessities were not
but only the spiritual refreshments of the soul
which alas we taste too seldom.
when a man hath come to this
that he seeketh comfort from no created thing
then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy god
then also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him.
then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little
but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust unto god
who is all in all to him
to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth
but all things live to him and obey his every word without delay.
remember always thine end
and how the time which is lost returneth not.
without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue.
if thou beginnest to grow cold
it shall begin to go ill with thee
but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace
and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the grace of god and the love of virtue.
a zealous and diligent man is ready for all things.
it is greater labour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily labours.
he who shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into greater.
at eventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably.
watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself
and howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself.
the more violence thou dost unto thyself
the more thou shall profit.
the second book
admonitions concerning the inner life
chapter i
of the inward life
the kingdom of god is within you, saith the lord.
turn thee with all thine heart to the lord and forsake this miserable world
and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul.
learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward
and thou shalt see the kingdom of god come within thee.
for the kingdom of god is peace and joy in the holy ghost
and it is not given to the wicked.
christ will come to thee
and show thee his consolation
if thou prepare a worthy mansion for him within thee.
all his glory and beauty is from within
and there it pleaseth him to dwell.
he often visiteth the inward man and holdeth with him sweet discourse
giving him soothing consolation, much peace
friendship exceeding wonderful.
go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee
for so he saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words
and my father will love him
and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.
give, therefore, place to christ and refuse entrance to all others.
when thou hast christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient.
he shall be thy provider and faithful watchman in all things
so that thou hast no need to trust in men
for men soon change and swiftly pass away
but christ remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.
there is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man
even though he be useful and dear to us
neither should much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us.
they who are on thy side to-day
may to-morrow be against thee
and often are they turned round like the wind.
put thy whole trust in god and let him be thy fear and thy love
he will answer for thee himself
and will do for thee what is best.
here hast thou no continuing city
and wheresoever thou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim
and thou shalt never have rest unless thou art closely united to christ within thee.
why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither
since this is not the place of thy rest
in heaven ought thy habitation to be
and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by.
all things pass away and thou equally with them.
look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them and perish.
let thy contemplation be on the most high
and let thy supplication be directed unto christ without ceasing.
if thou canst not behold high and heavenly things
rest thou in the passion of christ and dwell willingly in his sacred wounds.
for if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of jesus
and the precious marks of the nails and the spear
thou shalt find great comfort in tribulation
nor will the slights of men trouble thee much
and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.
christ also, when he was in the world
was despised and rejected of men
and in his greatest necessity was left by his acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches.
christ was willing to suffer and be despised
and darest thou complain of any
christ had adversaries and gainsayers
and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and benefactors
whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee
if thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity
how shalt thou be the friend of christ
sustain thyself with christ and for christ if thou wilt reign with christ.
if thou hadst once entered into the mind of jesus
and hadst tasted yea even a little of his tender love
then wouldst thou care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience
but wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee
because the love of jesus maketh a man to despise himself.
he who loveth jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections
is able to turn himself readily unto god
and to rise above himself in spirit
and to enjoy fruitful peace.
he who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or seem to be
he truly is wise, and is taught of god more than of men.
he who knoweth how to walk from within
and to set little value upon outward things
requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons
for holding his intercourse with god.
the inward man quickly recollecteth himself
because he is never entirely given up to outward things.
no outward labour and no necessary occupations stand in his way
but as events fall out
so doth he fit himself to them.
he who is rightly disposed and ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men.
a man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by outward things.
if it were well with thee
and thou wert purified from evil
all things would work together for thy good and profiting.
for this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee
that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things.
nothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love towards created things.
if thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly.
of lowly submission
make no great account who is for thee or against thee
but mind only the present duty and take care that god be with thee in whatsoever thou doest.
have a good conscience and god will defend thee
for he whom god will help no man’s perverseness shall be able to hurt.
if thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to suffer
without doubt thou shalt see the help of the lord.
he knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee
therefore must thou resign thyself to him.
to god it belongeth to help and to deliver from all confusion.
oftentimes it is very profitable for keeping us in greater humility
that others know and rebuke our faults.
when a man humbleth himself for his defects
he then easily pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered against him.
god protecteth and delivereth the humble man
he loveth and comforteth the humble man
to the humble man he inclineth himself
on the humble he bestoweth great grace
and when he is cast down he raiseth him to glory
to the humble he revealeth his secrets
and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to himself.
the humble man having received reproach
is yet in sufficient peace
because he resteth on god and not on the world.
reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel thyself to be inferior to all.
chapter iii
of the good, peaceable man
first keep thyself in peace
and then shalt thou be able to be a peacemaker towards others.
a peaceable man doth more good than a well-learned.
a passionate man turneth even good into evil and easily believeth evil
a good, peaceable man converteth all things into good.
he who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of none
but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many suspicions
and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to be quiet.
he often saith what he ought not to say
and omitteth what it were more expedient for him to do.
he considereth to what duties others are bound
and neglecteth those to which he is bound himself.
therefore be zealous first over thyself
and then mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour.
thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds
but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others.
it would be more just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother.
if thou wilt that others bear with thee, bear thou with others.
behold how far thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone.
it is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek
for this is naturally pleasing to all
and every one of us willingly enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us
but to be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse
or with the disorderly, or those who oppose us
this is a great grace and a thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.
there are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also with others
and there are who neither have peace nor suffer others to have peace
they are troublesome to others
but always more troublesome to themselves.
and there are who hold themselves in peace
and study to bring others unto peace
nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble suffering rather than in not feeling adversities.
he who best knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace
that man is conqueror of himself and lord of the world
the friend of christ, and the inheritor of heaven.
chapter iv
of a pure mind and simple intention
by two wings is man lifted above earthly things
even by simplicity and purity.
simplicity ought to be in the intention
purity in the affection.
simplicity reacheth towards god, purity apprehendeth him and tasteth him.
no good action will be distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate affection.
if thou reachest after and seekest
nothing but the will of god and the benefit of thy neighbour
thou wilt entirely enjoy inward liberty.
if thine heart were right
then should every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine.
there is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the goodness of god.
if thou wert good and pure within
then wouldst thou look upon all things without hurt and understand them aright.
a pure heart seeth the very depths of heaven and hell.
such as each one is inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly.
if there is any joy in the world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it
and if there is anywhere tribulation and anguish
the evil conscience knoweth it best.
as iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made altogether glowing
so the man who turneth himself altogether unto god is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man.
when a man beginneth to grow lukewarm
then he feareth a little labour
and willingly accepteth outward consolation
but when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk manfully in the way of god
then he counteth as nothing those things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him.
chapter v
of self-esteem
we cannot place too little confidence in ourselves
because grace and understanding are often lacking to us.
little light is there within us
and what we have we quickly lose by negligence.
oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness.
we often do ill and excuse it worse.
sometimes we are moved by passion and count it zeal
we blame little faults in others and pass over great faults in ourselves.
quickly enough we feel and reckon up what we bear at the hands of others
but we reflect not how much others are bearing from us.
he who would weigh well and rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of another.
the spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all cares
and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth silence concerning others.
thou wilt never be spiritually minded and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men’s matters and take full heed to thyself.
if thou think wholly upon thyself and upon god
what thou seest out of doors shall move thee little.
where art thou when thou art not present to thyself
and when thou hast overrun all things
what hath it profited thee, thyself being neglected
if thou wouldst have peace and true unity
thou must put aside all other things
and gaze only upon thyself.
then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free from all temporal care.
thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou set a value upon any worldly thing.
let nothing be great, nothing high, nothing pleasing
nothing acceptable unto thee
save god himself or the things of god.
reckon as altogether vain whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature.
the soul that loveth god looketh not to anything that is beneath god.
god alone is eternal and incomprehensible
filling all things, the solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.
chapter vi
of the joy of a good conscience
the testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man.
have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy.
a good conscience is able to bear exceeding much
and is exceeding joyful in the midst of adversities
an evil conscience is ever fearful and unquiet.
thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart condemn thee not.
never rejoice unless when thou hast done well.
the wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace
for there is no peace, saith my god, to the wicked.
and if they say we are in peace
there shall no harm happen unto us
and who shall dare to do us hurt, believe them not
for suddenly shall the wrath of god rise up against them
and their deeds shall be brought to nought
and their thoughts shall perish.
to glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth
for such glorying is glorying in the cross of christ.
brief is the glory which is given and received of men.
sadness always goeth hand in hand with the glory of the world.
the glory of the good is in their conscience
and not in the report of men.
the joy of the upright is from god and in god
and their joy is in the truth.
he who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for that which is temporal
and he who seeketh temporal glory
or who despiseth it from his heart
is proved to bear little love for that which is heavenly.
he who careth for neither praises nor reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart.
he will easily be contented and filled with peace
whose conscience is pure.
thou art none the holier if thou art praised
nor the viler if thou art reproached.
thou art what thou art
and thou canst not be better than god pronounceth thee to be.
if thou considerest well what thou art inwardly
thou wilt not care what men will say to thee.
man looketh on the outward appearance
but the lord looketh on the heart
man looketh on the deed, but god considereth the intent.
it is the token of a humble spirit always to do well
and to set little by oneself.
not to look for consolation from any created thing is a sign of great purity and inward faithfulness.
he that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf
showeth plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to god.
for not he that commendeth himself is approved, as st. paul saith
but whom the lord commendeth.
to walk inwardly with god, and not to be held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man.
chapter vii
of loving jesus above all things
blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love jesus
and to despise himself for jesus’ sake.
he must give up all that he loveth for his beloved
for jesus will be loved alone above all things.
the love of created things is deceiving and unstable
but the love of jesus is faithful and lasting.
he who cleaveth to created things will fall with their slipperiness
but he who embraceth jesus will stand upright for ever.
love him and hold him for thy friend
for he will not forsake thee when all depart from thee
nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last.
thou must one day be separated from all
whether thou wilt or wilt not.
cleave thou to jesus in life and death
and commit thyself unto his faithfulness
who, when all men fail thee, is alone able to help thee.
thy beloved is such, by nature, that he will suffer no rival
but alone will possess thy heart
and as a king will sit upon his own throne.
if thou wouldst learn to put away from thee every created thing
jesus would freely take up his abode with thee.
thou wilt find all trust little better than lost which thou hast placed in men
and not in jesus.
trust not nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind
because all flesh is grass
and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the field.
thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest only upon the outward appearance of men
for if thou seekest thy comfort and profit in others
thou shalt too often experience loss.
if thou seekest jesus in all things thou shalt verily find jesus
but if thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself
but to thine own hurt.
for if a man seeketh not jesus he is more hurtful to himself than all the world and all his adversaries.
chapter viii
of the intimate love of jesus
when jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard
but when jesus is not present everything is hard.
when jesus speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth
but if jesus speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience.
did not mary magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she wept when martha said to her
the master is come and calleth for thee
happy hour when jesus calleth thee from tears to the joy of the spirit
how dry and hard art thou without jesus
how senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond jesus
is not this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world ?
what can the world profit thee without jesus
to be without jesus is the nethermost hell
and to be with jesus is sweet paradise.
if jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee.
he who findeth jesus findeth a good treasure
yea, good above all good, and he who loseth jesus loseth exceeding much more than the whole world.
most poor is he who liveth without jesus
and most rich is he who is much with jesus.
it is great skill to know how to live with jesus
and to know how to hold jesus is great wisdom.
be thou humble and peaceable and jesus shall be with thee.
be godly and quiet
and jesus will remain with thee.
thou canst quickly drive away jesus and lose his favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things.
and if thou hast put him to flight and lost him
to whom wilt thou flee
and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend
without a friend thou canst not live long
and if jesus be not thy friend above all thou shalt be very sad and desolate.
madly therefore doest thou if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other.
it is preferable to have the whole world against thee
than jesus offended with thee.
therefore of all that are dear to thee
let jesus be specially loved.
let all be loved for jesus’ sake, but jesus for his own.
jesus christ alone is to be specially loved
for he alone is found good and faithful above all friends.
for his sake and in him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee
and pray for them all that they may all know and love him.
never desire to be specially praised or loved
because this belongeth to god alone
who hath none like unto himself.
nor wish thou that any one set his heart on thee
nor do thou give thyself up to the love of any
but let jesus be in thee and in every good man.
be pure and free within thyself
and be not entangled by any created thing.
thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to god
if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the lord is.
and in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by his grace
thou wilt not attain to this
that having cast out and dismissed all else
thou alone art united to god.
for when the grace of god cometh to a man
then he becometh able to do all things
and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and given up unto troubles.
in these thou art not to be cast down nor to despair
but to rest with calm mind on the will of god
and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of jesus christ
for after winter cometh summer, after night returneth day
after the tempest a great calm.
chapter ix
of the lack of all comfort
it is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is present.
it is a great thing, yea very great
to be able to bear the loss both of human and divine comfort
and for the love of god willingly to bear exile of heart
and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to one’s own merit.
what great matter is it
if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to thee
that is an hour wherein all rejoice.
pleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of god carrieth.
and what marvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the almighty
and is led onwards by the guide from on high ?
we are willing to accept anything for comfort
and it is difficult for a man to be freed from himself.
the holy martyr laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly master
because he despised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant
and for the love of christ he calmly suffered even god’s chief priest
thus by the love of the creator he overcame the love of man
and instead of human comfort he chose rather god’s good pleasure.
so also learn thou to resign any near and beloved friend for the love of god.
nor take it amiss when thou hast been deserted by a friend
knowing that we must all be parted from one another at last.
mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he learn altogether to overcome himself
and to draw his whole affection towards god.
when a man resteth upon himself
he easily slippeth away unto human comforts.
but a true lover of christ
and a diligent seeker after virtue
falleth not back upon those comforts
nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and handled
but desireth rather hard exercises
and to undertake severe labours for christ.
when, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by god, receive it with giving of thanks
and know that it is the gift of god
not thy desert.
be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume
but rather be more humble for the gift
more wary and more careful in all thy doings
for that hour will pass away
and temptation will follow.
when comfort is taken from thee
do not straightway despair
but wait for the heavenly visitation with humility and patience
for god is able to give thee back greater favour and consolation.
this is not new nor strange to those who have made trial of the way of god
for with the great saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change.
wherefore one said when the favour of god was present with him
i said in my prosperity i shall never be moved
but he goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour departed
thou didst turn thy face from me
and i was troubled.
in spite whereof he in no wise despaireth
but the more instantly entreateth god
and saith, unto thee, o lord
will i cry, and will pray unto my god
and then he receiveth the fruit of his prayer
and testifieth how he hath been heard
saying, the lord heard me and had mercy upon me
the lord was my helper.
but wherein, thou hast turned my heaviness into joy
thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.
if it was thus with the great saints
we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold
for the spirit cometh and goeth according to the good pleasure of his will.
wherefore holy job saith
thou dost visit him in the morning
and suddenly thou dost prove him.
whereupon then can i hope
or wherein may i trust
save only in the great mercy of god
and the hope of heavenly grace
for whether good men are with me
godly brethren or faithful friends
whether holy books or beautiful discourses
whether sweet hymns and songs
all these help but little
and have but little savour when i am deserted by god’s favour and left to mine own poverty.
there is no better remedy
then than patience and denial of self
and an abiding in the will of god.
i have never found any man so religious and godly
but that he felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour
and lack of fervour.
no saint was ever so filled with rapture
so enlightened but that sooner or later he was tempted.
for he is not worthy of the great vision of god
who for god’s sake hath not been exercised by some temptation.
for temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow
and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by temptation.
as it is written
to him that overcometh i will give to eat of the tree of life.
divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear adversities.
and temptation followeth lest he be lifted up because of the benefit.
the devil sleepeth not thy flesh is not yet dead
therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle
for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at rest.
chapter x
of gratitude for the grace of god
why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour
prepare thyself for patience more than for comforts
and for bearing the cross more than for joy.
for who among the men of this world would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it
for spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world
and all the pleasures of the flesh.
for all worldly delights are either empty or unclean
whilst spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable
the offspring of virtue, and poured forth by god into pure minds.
but no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own will
because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.
great is the difference between a visitation from above and false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self.
god doeth well in giving us the grace of comfort
but man doeth ill in not immediately giving god thanks thereof.
and thus the gifts of grace are not able to flow unto us
because we are ungrateful to the author of them
and return them not wholly to the fountain whence they flow.
for grace ever becometh the portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from the proud
which is wont to be given to the humble.
i desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction
i love no contemplation which leadeth to pride.
for all that is high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good
every desire is not pure
nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto god.
willingly do i accept that grace whereby i am made humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself.
he who is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof
will not dare to claim any good thing for himself
but will rather confess that he is poor and needy.
give unto god the thing which is god’s
and ascribe to thyself that which is thine
that is give thanks unto god for his grace
but for thyself alone confess thy fault
and that thy punishment is deserved for thy fault.
sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given the highest place.
for the highest cannot be without the lowest.
for the highest saints of god are least in their own sight
and the more glorious they are
so much the lowlier are they in themselves
full of grace and heavenly glory
they are not desirous of vain-glory
resting on god and strong in his might
they cannot be lifted up in any wise.
and they who ascribe unto god all the good which they have received
seek not glory one of another
but the glory which cometh from god only
and they desire that god shall be praised in himself and in all his saints above all things
and they are always striving for this very thing.
be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be worthy to receive greater.
let the least be unto thee even as the greatest
and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a special gift.
if the majesty of the giver be considered
nothing that is given shall seem small and of no worth
for that is not a small thing which is given by the most high god.
yea, though he gave punishment and stripes
we ought to be thankful
because he ever doth for our profit whatever he suffereth to come upon us.
he who seeketh to retain the favour of god
let him be thankful for the favour which is given
and patient in respect of that which is taken away.
let him pray that it may return
let him be wary and humble that he lose it not.
of the fewness of those who love the cross of jesus
jesus hath many lovers of his heavenly kingdom
but few bearers of his cross.
he hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation.
he findeth many companions of his table, but few of his fasting.
all desire to rejoice with him
few are willing to undergo anything for his sake.
many follow jesus that they may eat of his loaves
but few that they may drink of the cup of his passion.
many are astonished at his miracles
few follow after the shame of his cross.
many love jesus so long as no adversities happen to them.
many praise him and bless him
so long as they receive any comforts from him.
but if jesus hide himself and withdraw from them a little while
they fall either into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.
but they who love jesus for jesus’ sake
and not for any consolation of their own
bless him in all tribulation and anguish of heart as in the highest consolation.
and if he should never give them consolation
nevertheless they would always praise him and always give him thanks.
oh what power hath the pure love of jesus
unmixed with any gain or love of self
should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations
do they not prove themselves lovers of self more than of christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage
where shall be found one who is willing to serve god altogether for nought ?
rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all selfish thoughts
for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and free of all created things
his value is from afar, yea from the ends of the earth
a man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing
and if he do many deeds of penitence
yet that is a small thing
and though he understand all knowledge
yet that is afar off
and if he have great virtue and zealous devotion
yet much is lacking unto him
yea, one thing which is the most necessary to him of all.
what is it then, that having given up all things besides
he give up himself and go forth from himself utterly
and retain nothing of self-love
and having done all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do
that he feel that he hath done nothing.
let him not reckon that much which might be much esteemed
but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an unprofitable servant
as the truth himself saith
when ye have done all things that are commanded you
say, we are unprofitable servants.
then may he be truly poor and naked in spirit
and be able to say with the prophet
as for me, i am poor and needy.
nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man stronger, no man freer.
for he knoweth both how to give up himself and all things
and how to be lowly in his own eyes.
chapter xii
of the royal way of the holy cross
that seemeth a hard saying to many
if any man will come after me
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
but it will be much harder to hear that last sentence
depart from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire.
for they who now willingly hear the word of the cross and follow it
shall not then fear the hearing of eternal damnation.
this sign of the cross shall be in heaven when the lord cometh to judgment.
then all servants of the cross, who in life have conformed themselves to the crucified
shall draw nigh unto christ the judge with great boldness.
why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a kingdom
in the cross is health
in the cross is life
in the cross is protection from enemies
in the cross is heavenly sweetness
in the cross strength of mind
in the cross joy of the spirit
in the cross the height of virtue
in the cross perfection of holiness.
there is no health of the soul
no hope of eternal life, save in the cross.
take up therefore, thy cross and follow jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life.
he went before thee bearing his cross and died for thee upon the cross
that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be crucified upon it.
for if thou be dead with him, thou shalt also live with him
and if thou be a partaker of his sufferings thou shalt be also of his glory.
behold everything dependeth upon the cross
and everything lieth in dying
and there is none other way unto life and to true inward peace
except the way of the holy cross and of daily mortification.
go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt
and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below
than the way of the holy cross.
dispose and order all things according to thine own will and judgment
and thou shalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly
and thus thou shalt ever find thy cross.
for thou shalt either feel pain of body
or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.
sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of god
sometimes thou wilt be tried by thy neighbour
and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome to thyself.
and still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any remedy or consolation
but must bear so long as god will.
for god will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation
and to submit thyself fully to it
and by tribulation be made more humble.
no man understandeth the passion of christ in his heart so well as he who hath had somewhat of the like suffering himself.
the cross therefore is always ready
and every where waiteth for thee.
thou canst not flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest
for whithersoever thou comest
thou bearest thyself with thee
and shalt ever find thyself.
turn thee above
turn thee below
turn thee without
turn thee within
and in them all thou shalt find the cross
and needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown.
if thou willingly bear the cross
it will bear thee and will bring thee to the end which thou seekest
even where there shall be the end of suffering
though it shall not be here.
if thou bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy load
and yet thou must bear it.
if thou cast away one cross
without doubt thou shalt find another and perchance a heavier.
thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid
which of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and tribulation
for not even jesus christ our lord was one hour without the anguish of his passion
so long as he lived.
it behooved, he said, christ to suffer and to rise from the dead
and so enter into his glory.
and how dost thou seek another way than this royal way
which is the way of the holy cross ?
the whole life of christ was a cross and martyrdom
and dost thou seek for thyself rest and joy
thou art wrong
if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations
for this whole mortal life is full of miseries
and set round with crosses.
and the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit
the heavier crosses he will often find
because the sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.
but yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted
is not without refreshment of consolation
because he feeleth abundant fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross.
for whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it
every burden of tribulation is turned into an assurance of divine comfort
and the more the flesh is wasted by affliction
the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by inward grace.
and ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and adversity
through love of conformity to the cross of christ
that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation
for he believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to god
the more and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for his sake.
this is not the virtue of man
but the grace of christ which hath such power and energy in the weak flesh
that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from
this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit.
it is not in the nature of man to bear the cross
to love the cross
to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection
to fly from honours
to bear reproaches meekly
to despise self and desire to be despised
to bear all adversities and losses
and to desire no prosperity in this world.
if thou lookest to thyself
thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this
but if thou trustest in the lord
endurance shall be given thee from heaven
and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command.
yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil
if thou be armed with faith and signed with the cross of christ.
set thyself, therefore
like a good and faithful servant of christ
to the manful bearing of the cross of thy lord
who out of love was crucified for thee.
prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life
because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art
and so in very deed thou shalt find it
wherever thou hide thyself.
this it must be
and there is no means of escaping from tribulation and sorrow
except to bear them patiently.
drink thou lovingly thy lord’s cup if thou desirest to be his friend and to have thy lot with him.
leave consolations to god
let him do as seemeth best to him concerning them.
but do thou set thyself to endure tribulations
and reckon them the best consolations
for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
nor would they be even if thou wert to endure them all.
when thou hast come to this
that tribulation is sweet and pleasant to thee for christ’s sake
then reckon that it is well with thee
because thou hast found paradise on earth.
so long as it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape
so long it will not be well with thee
and tribulations will follow thee everywhere.
if thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest
namely, to suffer and to die
it shall soon go better with thee
and thou shalt find peace.
though thou shouldest be caught up with paul unto the third heaven
thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil.
i will show him, saith jesus, what great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
it remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer
if thou wilt love jesus and serve him continually.
oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of jesus
how great glory should await thee
what rejoicing among all the saints of god
what bright example also to thy neighbour
for all men commend patience
although few be willing to practise it.
thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for christ when many suffer heavier things for the world.
know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a dying man.
and the more a man dieth to himself
the more he beginneth to live towards god.
none is fit for the understanding of heavenly things
unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for christ.
nothing more acceptable to god
nothing more healthful for thyself in this world
than to suffer willingly for christ.
and if it were thine to choose
thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for christ
than to be refreshed with manifold consolations
for thou wouldest be more like christ and more conformed to all saints.
for our worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and consolations
but rather in bearing many troubles and adversities.
if indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to the health of men than to suffer
christ would surely have shown it by word and example.
for both the disciples who followed him
and all who desire to follow him
he plainly exhorteth to bear their cross
and saith, if any man will come after me
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
so now that we have thoroughly read and studied all things
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god.
the third book
on inward consolation
chapter i
of the inward voice of christ to the faithful soul
i will hearken what the lord god shall say within me.
blessed is the soul which heareth the lord speaking within it
and receiveth the word of consolation from his mouth.
blessed are the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of god
and turn not aside to the whisperings of this world.
blessed truly are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without
but to that which teacheth truth inwardly.
blessed are the eyes which are closed to things without
but are fixed upon things within.
blessed are they who search inward things and study to prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the receiving of heavenly mysteries.
blessed are they who long to have leisure for god
and free themselves from every hindrance of the world.
think on these things
o my soul, and shut the doors of thy carnal desires
so mayest thou hear what the lord god will say within thee.
these things saith thy beloved
i am thy salvation, i am thy peace and thy life.
keep thee unto me, and thou shalt find peace
put away thee all transitory things
seek those things that are eternal.
for what are all temporal things but deceits
and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken by the creator
therefore put all things else away
and give thyself to the creator
to be well pleasing and faithful to him
that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness.
chapter ii
what the truth saith inwardly without noise of words
speak lord, for thy servant heareth.
i am thy servant
o give me understanding that i may know thy testimonies.
incline my heart unto the words of thy mouth.
let thy speech distil as the dew.
the children of israel spake in old time to moses
speak thou unto us and we will hear
but let not the lord speak unto us lest we die.
not thus, o lord, not thus do i pray
but rather with samuel the prophet
i beseech thee humbly and earnestly
speak, lord, for thy servant heareth.
let not moses speak to me
nor any prophet, but rather speak thou
o lord, who didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets
for thou alone without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge
whilst they without thee shall profit nothing.
they can indeed utter words
but they give not the spirit.
they speak with exceeding beauty
but when thou art silent they kindle not the heart.
they give us scriptures
but thou makest known the sense thereof.
they bring us mysteries
but thou revealest the things which are signified.
they utter commandments, but thou helpest to the fulfilling of them.
they show the way, but thou givest strength for the journey.
they act only outwardly, but thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart.
they water, but thou givest the increase.
they cry with words, but thou givest understanding to the hearer.
therefore let not moses speak to me, but thou
o lord my god, eternal truth, lest i die and bring forth no fruit
being outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within
lest the word heard but not followed
known but not loved, believed but not obeyed
rise up against me in the judgment.
speak, lord, for thy servant heareth
thou hast the words of eternal life.
speak unto me for some consolation unto my soul
for the amendment of my whole life
and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of thy name.
chapter iii
how all the words of god are to be heard with humility
and how many consider them not
my son, hear my words, for my words are most sweet
surpassing all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world.
my words are spirit, and they are life
and are not to be weighed by man’s understanding.
they are not to be drawn forth for vain approbation
but to be heard in silence
and to be received with all humility and with deep love
and i said, blessed is the man whom thou teachest
o lord, and instructest him in thy law
that thou mayest give him rest in time of adversity
and that he be not desolate in the earth
i, saith the lord, taught the prophets from the beginning
and even now cease i not to speak unto all
but many are deaf and hardened against my voice
many love to listen to the world rather than to god
they follow after the desires of the flesh more readily than after the good pleasure of god.
the world promiseth things that are temporal and small
and it is served with great eagerness.
i promise things that are great and eternal
and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir.
who serveth and obeyeth me in all things
with such carefulness as he serveth the world and its rulers ?
and if thou reason seekest, hear thou me.
for a little reward men make a long journey
for eternal life many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground.
mean reward is sought after
for a single piece of money sometimes there is shameful striving
for a thing which is vain and for a trifling promise
men shrink not from toiling day and night
but, o shame, for an unchangeable good
for an inestimable reward
for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not away
it is irksome to them to toil even a little.
be thou ashamed therefore
slothful and discontented servant
for they are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life.
they rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth.
sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope
but my promise faileth no man
nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth in me.
what i have promised i will give
what i have said i will fulfil
if only a man remain faithful in my love unto the end.
therefore am i the rewarder of all good men
and a strong approver of all who are godly.
write my words in thy heart and consider them diligently
for they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation.
what thou understandest not when thou readest
thou shalt know in the time of thy visitation.
i am wont to visit mine elect in twofold manner
even by temptation and by comfort
and i teach them two lessons day by day
the one in chiding their faults
the other in exhorting them to grow in grace.
he who hath my words and rejecteth them
hath one who shall judge him at the last day
a prayer for the spirit of devotion
o lord my god, thou art all my good
and who am i that i should dare to speak unto thee
i am the very poorest of thy servants
an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than i know or dare to say.
nevertheless remember, o lord, that i am nothing
i have nothing and can do nothing.
thou only art good, just and holy
thou canst do all things, art over all things, fillest all things
leaving empty only the sinner.
call to mind thy tender mercies
and fill my heart with thy grace
thou who wilt not that thy work should return to thee void.
how can i bear this miserable life unless thy mercy and grace strengthen me
turn not away thy face from me
delay not thy visitation.
withdraw not thou thy comfort from me
lest my soul gasp after thee as a thirsty land
lord, teach me to do thy will
teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before thee
for thou art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth
and knewest me before the world was made and before i was born into the world.
chapter iv
how we must walk in truth and humility before god
my son, walk before me in truth
and in the simplicity of thy heart seek me continually.
he who walketh before me in the truth shall be safe from evil assaults
and the truth shall deliver him from the wiles and slanders of the wicked.
if the truth shall make thee free
thou shalt be free indeed
and shalt not care for the vain words of men
lord, it is true as thou sayest
let it, i pray thee, be so with me
let thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me safe unto the end.
let it free me from all evil and inordinate affection
and i will walk before thee in great freedom of heart.
i will teach thee, saith the truth
the things which are right and pleasing before me.
think upon thy sins with great displeasure and sorrow
and never think thyself anything because of thy good works.
verily thou art a sinner, liable to many passions
yea, tied and bound with them.
of thyself thou always tendest unto nothing
thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone.
thou hast nought whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon thyself vile
for thou art far weaker than thou art able to comprehend.
let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great
let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty
nothing worthy of honour, nothing lofty
nothing praiseworthy or desirable, save what is eternal.
let the eternal truth please thee above all things
let thine own great vileness displease thee continually.
fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own faults and sins
which ought to be more displeasing to thee than any loss whatsoever of goods.
there are some who walk not sincerely before me
but being led by curiosity and pride
they desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things of god
whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation.
these often fall into great temptations and sins because of their pride and curiosity
for i am against them.
fear thou the judgments of god
fear greatly the wrath of the almighty.
shrink from debating upon the works of the most high
but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins thou hast fallen
and how many good things thou hast neglected.
there are some who carry their devotion only in books
some in pictures, some in outward signs and figures
some have me in their mouths, but little in their hearts.
others there are who
being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their affections
continually long after eternal things
hear of earthly things with unwillingness
obey the necessities of nature with sorrow.
and these understand what the spirit of truth speaketh in them
for he teacheth them to despise earthly things and to love heavenly
to neglect the world and to desire heaven all the day and night
chapter v
of the wonderful power of the divine love
i bless thee, o heavenly father, father of my lord jesus christ
for that thou hast vouchsafed to think of me
poor that i am.
o, father of mercies and god of all comfort
i give thanks unto thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort
when i am unworthy of any comfort.
i bless and glorify thee continually
with thine only begotten son and the holy ghost, the paraclete
for ever and ever.
o lord god, holy lover of my soul
when thou shalt come into my heart
all my inward parts shall rejoice.
thou art my glory and the joy of my heart.
thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.
but because i am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue
i need to be strengthened and comforted by thee
therefore visit thou me often and instruct me with thy holy ways of discipline.
deliver me from evil passions
and cleanse my heart from all inordinate affections
that being healed and altogether cleansed within
i may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast to endure.
love is a great thing, a good above all others
which alone maketh every heavy burden light
and equaliseth every inequality.
for it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden
it maketh every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste.
the surpassing love of jesus impelleth to great works
and exciteth to the continual desiring of greater perfection.
love willeth to be raised up
and not to be held down by any mean thing.
love willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection
lest its inward power of vision be hindered
lest it be entangled by any worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity.
nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader, nothing pleasanter
nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on earth
for love was born of god and cannot rest save in god above all created things.
he who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad, he is free and not hindered.
he giveth all things for all things
and hath all things in all things
because he resteth in one who is high above all
from whom every good floweth and proceedeth.
he looketh not for gifts
but turneth himself to the giver above all good things.
love oftentimes knoweth no measure
but breaketh out above all measure
love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours
striveth after more than it is able to do
pleadeth not impossibility
because it judgeth all things which are lawful for it to be possible.
it is strong therefore for all things
and it fulfilleth many things
and is successful where he who loveth not faileth and lieth down.
love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch
though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced
though alarmed it is not terrified
but like the living flame and the burning torch
it breaketh forth on high and securely triumpheth.
if a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth.
for the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the ears of god
and it saith, my god, my beloved
thou art all mine, and i am all thine.
enlarge thou me in love
that i may learn to taste with the innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love
to be dissolved, and to swim in love.
let me be holden by love
mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration.
let me sing the song of love, let me follow thee my beloved on high
let my soul exhaust itself in thy praise, exulting with love.
let me love thee more than myself, not loving myself except for thy sake
and all men in thee who truly love thee
as the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from thee.
for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he falleth from love.
love is subject and obedient to all that are in authority
vile and lowly in its own sight
devout and grateful towards god
faithful and always trusting in him even when god hideth his face
for without sorrow we cannot live in love.
he who is not ready to suffer all things
and to conform to the will of the beloved
is not worthy to be called a lover of god.
it behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard and bitter things for the beloved’s sake
and not to be drawn away from him because of any contrary accidents.
chapter vi
of the proving of the true lover
my son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love
wherefore, o my lord ?
because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy undertakings
and too eagerly seekest after consolation.
the strong lover standeth fast in temptations
and believeth not the evil persuasions of the enemy.
as in prosperity i please him
so in adversity i do not displease.
the prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so much as the love of the giver.
he looketh for the affection more than the value
and setteth all gifts lower than the beloved.
the noble lover resteth not in the gift
but in me above every gift.
all is not lost, though thou sometimes think of me or of my saints
less than thou shouldest desire.
that good and sweet affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country
but hereon thou must not too much depend
for it goeth and cometh.
but to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to us
and to resist the suggestions of the devil
is a token of virtue and great merit.
therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee
whencesoever they arise.
bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright intentions towards god.
it is not an illusion when thou art sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture
and then suddenly art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart.
for thou dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them
and so long as they displease thee and thou strivest against them
it is a merit and no loss.
know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder thy pursuit after good
and to deter thee from every godly exercise
to wit, the contemplation of the saints
the pious remembrance of my passion
the profitable recollection of sin
the keeping of thy own heart
and the steadfast purpose to grow in virtue.
he suggesteth to thee many evil thoughts
that he may work in thee weariness and terror
and so draw thee away from prayer and holy reading.
humble confession displeaseth him
and if he were able he would make thee to cease from communion.
believe him not, nor heed him
though many a time he hath laid for thee the snares of deceit.
account it to be from him, when he suggesteth evil and unclean thoughts.
say unto him, depart unclean spirit, put on shame, miserable one
horribly unclean art thou, who bringest such things to mine ears.
depart from me, detestable deceiver, thou shalt have no part in me
but jesus shall be with me, as a strong warrior
and thou shalt stand confounded.
rather would i die and bear all suffering
than consent unto thee.
hold thy peace and be dumb, i will not hear thee more
though thou plottest more snares against me.
the lord is my light and my salvation
whom then shall i fear
though a host of men should rise up against me
yet shall not my heart be afraid.
the lord is my strength and my redeemer
strive thou like a good soldier
and if sometimes thou fail through weakness
put on thy strength more bravely than before
trusting in my more abundant grace
and take thou much heed of vain confidence and pride.
because of it many are led into error
and sometimes fall into blindness well-nigh irremediable.
let this ruin of the proud
who foolishly lift themselves up
be to thee for a warning and a continual exhortation to humility
chapter vii
of hiding our grace under the guard of humility
my son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of devotion
and not to lift thyself up on high
nor to speak much thereof
nor to value it greatly
but rather to despise thyself
and to fear as though this grace were given to one unworthy thereof.
nor must thou depend too much upon this feeling
for it can very quickly be turned into its opposite.
think when thou art in a state of grace how miserable and poor thou art wont to be without grace.
nor is there advance in spiritual life in this alone
that thou hast the grace of consolation
but that thou humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the withdrawal thereof
so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer
nor suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected
rather do thy task more readily
as though thou hadst gained more strength and knowledge
and do not altogether neglect thyself because of the dearth and anxiety of spirit which thou feelest.
for there are many who
when things have not gone prosperous with them
become forthwith impatient or slothful.
for the way of a man is not in himself
but it is god’s to give and to console
when he will, and as much as he will
and whom he will, as it shall please him and no further.
some who were presumptuous because of the grace of devotion within them
have destroyed themselves
because they would do more than they were able
not considering the measure of their own littleness
but rather following the impulse of the heart than the judgment of the reason.
and because they presumed beyond what was well-pleasing unto god
therefore they quickly lost grace.
they became poor and were left vile
who had built for themselves their nest in heaven
so that being humbled and stricken with poverty
they might learn not to fly with their own wings
but to put their trust under my feathers.
they who are as yet new and unskilled in the way of the lord
unless they rule themselves after the counsel of the wise
may easily be deceived and led away.
but if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than trust the experience of others
the result will be very dangerous to them if they still refuse to be drawn away from their own notion.
those who are wise in their own conceits
seldom patiently endure to be ruled by others.
it is better to have a small portion of wisdom with humility
and a slender understanding
than great treasures of sciences with vain self-esteem.
it is better for thee to have less than much of what may make thee proud.
he doeth not very discreetly who giveth up himself entirely to joy
forgetting his former helplessness and the chaste fear of the lord
which feareth to lose the grace offered.
nor is he very wise, after a manly sort
who in time of adversity, or any trouble whatsoever
beareth himself too despairingly
and feeleth concerning me less trustfully than he ought.
he who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be often found in time of war overdispirited and full of fears.
if thou knewest always how to continue humble and moderate in thyself
and to guide and rule thine own spirit well
thou wouldest not so quickly fall into danger and mischief.
it is good counsel that when fervour of spirit is kindled
thou shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the light is taken away.
which when it doth happen
remember that still the light may return again
which i have taken away for a time for a warning to thee
and also for mine own glory.
such a trial is often more useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous according to thine own will.
for merits are not to be reckoned by this
that a man hath many visions or consolations
or that he is skilled in the scriptures
or that he is placed in a high situation
but that he is grounded upon true humility and filled with divine charity
that he always purely and uprightly seeketh the honour of god
that he setteth not by himself
but unfeignedly despiseth himself
and even rejoiceth to be despised and humbled by others more than to be honoured
chapter viii
of a low estimation of self in the sight of god
i will speak unto my lord who am but dust and ashes.
if i count myself more, behold thou standest against me
and my iniquities bear true testimony
and i cannot gainsay it.
but if i abase myself
and bring myself to nought
and shrink from all self-esteem
and grind myself to dust
which i am, thy grace will be favourable unto me
and thy light will be near unto my heart
and all self-esteem, how little soever it be
shall be swallowed up in the depths of my nothingness
and shall perish for ever.
there thou showest to me myself
what i am, what i was
and whither i have come
so foolish was i and ignorant.
if i am left to myself
behold i am nothing
i am all weakness
but if suddenly thou look upon me
immediately i am made strong
and filled with new joy.
and it is great marvel that i am so suddenly lifted up
and so graciously embraced by thee
since i am always being carried to the deep by my own weight.
this is the doing of thy love which freely goeth before me and succoureth me in so many necessities
which guardeth me also in great dangers and snatcheth me
as i may truly say
from innumerable evils.
for verily, by loving myself amiss, i lost myself
and by seeking and sincerely loving thee alone
i found both myself and thee
and through love i have brought myself to yet deeper nothingness
because thou, o most sweet lord
dealest with me beyond all merit
and above all which i dare ask or think.
blessed be thou, o my god
because though i be unworthy of all thy benefits
thy bountiful and infinite goodness never ceaseth to do good even to ingrates and to those who are turned far from thee.
turn thou us unto thyself
that we may be grateful, humble, and godly
for thou art our salvation, our courage, and our strength.
chapter ix
that all things are to be referred to god
as the final end, my son, i must be thy supreme and final end
if thou desirest to be truly happy.
out of such purpose thy affection shall be purified
which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon created things.
for if thou seekest thyself in any matter
straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren.
therefore refer everything to me first of all
for it is i who gave thee all.
so look upon each blessing as flowing from the supreme good
and thus all things are to be attributed to me as their source.
from me the humble and great, the poor and the rich, draw water as from a living fountain
and those who serve me with a free and faithful spirit shall receive grace for grace.
but he who will glory apart from me
or will be delighted with any good which lieth in himself
shall not be established in true joy
nor shall be enlarged in heart
but shall be greatly hindered and thrown into tribulation.
therefore thou must not ascribe any good to thyself
nor look upon virtue as belonging to any man
but ascribe it all unto god
without whom man hath nothing.
i gave all, i will receive all again
and with great strictness require i the giving of thanks.
this is the truth, and by it the vanity of boasting is put to flight.
and if heavenly grace and true charity shall enter into thee
there shall be no envy, nor straitening of the heart
nor shall any self-love take possession of thee.
for divine charity conquereth all things
and enlargeth all the powers of the soul.
if thou art truly wise, thou wilt rejoice in me alone
thou wilt hope in me alone, for there is none good but one
that is god, who is to be praised above all things
and in all things to receive blessing
chapter x
that it is sweet to despise the world and to serve god
now will i speak again, o my lord
and hold not my peace, i will say in the ears of my god
my lord, and my king, who is exalted above all
oh how plentiful is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee
but what art thou to those who love thee
what to those who serve thee with their whole heart
truly unspeakable is the sweetness of the contemplation of thee
which thou bestowest upon those who love thee.
in this most of all thou hast showed me the sweetness of thy charity
that when i was not, thou madest me
and when i wandered far from thee
thou broughtest me back that i might serve thee
and commandedst me to love thee.
o fountain of perpetual love, what shall i say concerning thee
how shall i be unmindful of thee
who didst vouchsafe to remember me
even after i pined away and perished
thou hast had mercy beyond all hope upon thy servant
and hast showed thy grace and friendship beyond all deserving.
what reward shall i render thee for this thy grace
for it is not given unto all to renounce this world and its affairs
and to take up a religious life.
for is it a great thing that i should serve thee
whom every creature ought to serve
it ought not to seem a great thing to me to serve thee
but rather this appeareth to me a great and wonderful thing
that thou vouchsafest to receive as thy servant one so poor and unworthy
and to join him unto thy chosen servants.
behold all things which i have are thine
and with them i serve thee.
and yet verily it is thou who servest me
rather than i thee.
behold the heaven and the earth which thou hast created for the service of men
they are at thy bidding, and perform daily whatsoever thou dost command.
yea, and this is little
for thou hast even ordained the angels for the service of man.
but it surpasseth even all these things
that thou thyself didst vouchsafe to minister unto man
and didst promise that thou wouldest give thyself unto him.
what shall i render unto thee for all these thy manifold mercies
oh that i were able to serve thee all the days of my life
oh that even for one day i were enabled to do thee service worthy of thyself
for verily thou art worthy of all service
all honour and praise without end.
verily thou art my god, and i am thy poor servant
who am bound to serve thee with all my strength
nor ought i ever to grow weary of thy praise.
this is my wish, this is my exceeding great desire
and whatsoever is lacking to me
vouchsafe thou to supply.
it is great honour, great glory to serve thee
and to despise all for thy sake.
for they shall have great grace who of their own will shall submit themselves to thy most holy service.
they who for thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find the sweetest consolation of the holy ghost.
they who enter the narrow way of life for thy name’s sake
and have put away all worldly cares
shall attain great liberty of spirit.
oh grateful and delightsome service of god
whereby man is made truly free and holy
oh sacred condition of the religious servant
which maketh man equal to the angels
well-pleasing unto god, terrible to evil spirits
and acceptable to all faithful ones
oh service to be embraced and ever desired
in which the highest good is promised
and joy is gained which shall remain for evermore
chapter xi
that the desires of the heart are to be examined and governed
my son, thou hast still many things to learn
which thou hast not well learned yet
what are they, lord ?
to place thy desire altogether in subjection to my good pleasure
and not to be a lover of thyself
but an earnest seeker of my will.
thy desires often excite and urge thee forward
but consider with thyself whether thou art not more moved for thine own objects than for my honour.
if it is myself that thou seekest
thou shalt be well content with whatsoever i shall ordain
but if any pursuit of thine own lieth hidden within thee
behold it is this which hindereth and weigheth thee down.
beware, therefore, lest thou strive too earnestly after some desire which thou hast conceived
without taking counsel of me, lest haply it repent thee afterwards
and that displease thee which before pleased
and for which thou didst long as for a great good.
for not every affection which seemeth good is to be forthwith followed
neither is every opposite affection to be immediately avoided.
sometimes it is expedient to use restraint even in good desires and wishes
lest through importunity thou fall into distraction of mind
lest through want of discipline thou become a stumbling-block to others
or lest by the resistance of others thou be suddenly disturbed and brought to confusion.
sometimes, indeed, it is needful to use violence
and manfully to strive against the sensual appetite
and not to consider what the flesh may or not will
but rather to strive after this
that it may become subject, however unwillingly, to the spirit.
and for so long it ought to be chastised and compelled to undergo slavery
even until it be ready for all things
and learn to be contented with little
to be delighted with things simple
and never to murmur at any inconvenience
chapter xii
of the inward growth of patience
and of the struggle against evil desires
o lord god, i see that patience is very necessary unto me
for many things in this life fall out contrary.
for howsoever i may have contrived for my peace
my life cannot go on without strife and trouble.
thou speakest truly, my son.
for i will not that thou seek such a peace as is without trials
and knoweth no adversities
but rather that thou shouldest judge thyself to have found peace
when thou art tried with manifold tribulations
and proved by many adversities.
if thou shalt say that thou art not able to bear much
how then wilt thou sustain the fire hereafter
of two evils we should always choose the less.
therefore, that thou mayest escape eternal torments hereafter
strive on god’s behalf to endure present evils bravely.
thinkest thou that the children of this world suffer nought
or but little, thou wilt not find it so
even though thou find out the most prosperous.
but, thou wilt say, they have many delights
and they follow their own wills
and thus they bear lightly their tribulations
be it so, grant that they have what they list
but how long, thinkest thou, will it last
behold, like the smoke those who are rich in this world will pass away
and no record shall remain of their past joys.
yea, even while they yet live
they rest not without bitterness and weariness and fear.
for from the very same thing wherein they find delight
thence they oftentimes have the punishment of sorrow.
justly it befalleth them
that because out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures
they enjoy them not without confusion and bitterness.
oh how short, how false
how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures
yet because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand
but like brute beasts
for the sake of a little pleasure of this corruptible life
they incur death of the soul.
thou therefore, my son, go not after thy lusts
but refrain thyself from thine appetites.
delight thou in the lord
and he shall give thee thy heart’s desire.
for if thou wilt truly find delight
and be abundantly comforted of me
behold in the contempt of all worldly things and in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy blessing
and fulness of consolation shall be given thee.
and the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures
the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find.
but at the first thou shalt not attain to them
without some sorrow and hard striving.
long-accustomed habit will oppose
but it shall be overcome by better habit.
the flesh will murmur again and again
but will be restrained by fervour of spirit.
the old serpent will urge and embitter thee
but will be put to flight by prayer
moreover, by useful labour his entrance will be greatly obstructed
chapter xiii
of the obedience of one in lowly subjection after the example of jesus christ
my son, he who striveth to withdraw himself from obedience
withdraweth himself also from grace
and he who seeketh private advantages
loseth those which are common unto all.
if a man submit not freely and willingly to one set over him
it is a sign that his flesh is not yet perfectly subject to himself
but often resisteth and murmureth.
learn therefore quickly to submit thyself to him who is over thee
if thou seekest to bring thine own flesh into subjection.
for the outward enemy is very quickly overcome if the inner man have not been laid low.
there is no more grievous and deadly enemy to the soul than thou art to thyself
if thou art not led by the spirit.
thou must not altogether conceive contempt for thyself
if thou wilt prevail against flesh and blood.
because as yet thou inordinately lovest thyself
therefore thou shrinkest from yielding thyself to the will of others.
but what great thing is it that thou
who art dust and nothingness, yieldest thyself to man for god’s sake
when i, the almighty and the most high
who created all things out of nothing
subjected myself to man for thy sake
i became the most humble and despised of men
that by my humility thou mightest overcome thy pride.
learn to obey, o dust, learn to humble thyself
o earth and clay
and to bow thyself beneath the feet of all.
learn to crush thy passions
and to yield thyself in all subjection.
be zealous against thyself
nor suffer pride to live within thee
but so show thyself subject and of no reputation
that all may be able to walk over thee
and tread thee down as the clay in the streets.
what hast thou, o foolish man, of which to complain
what, o vile sinner, canst thou answer those who speak against thee
seeing thou hast so often offended god
and many a time hast deserved hell
but mine eye hath spared thee
because thy soul was precious in my sight
that thou mightest know my love
and mightest be thankful for my benefits
and that thou mightest give thyself altogether to true subjection and humility
and patiently bear the contempt which thou meritest
chapter xiv
of meditation upon the hidden judgments of god
that we may not be lifted up because of our well-doing
thou sendest forth thy judgments against me
o lord, and shakest all my bones with fear and trembling
and my soul trembleth exceedingly.
i stand astonished, and remember that the heavens are not clean in thy sight.
if thou chargest thine angels with folly
and didst spare them not, how shall it be unto me
stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall i dare who am but dust
they whose works seemed to be praiseworthy
fell into the lowest depths
and they who did eat angels’ food
them have i seen delighted with the husks that the swine do eat.
there is therefore no holiness
if thou o lord withdraw thine hand.
no wisdom profiteth
if thou leave off to guide the helm.
no strength availeth
if thou cease to preserve.
no purity is secure
if thou protect it not.
no self-keeping availeth
if thy holy watching be not there.
for when we are left alone we are swallowed up and perish
but when we are visited
we are raised up, and we live.
for indeed we are unstable
but are made strong through thee
we grow cold, but are rekindled by thee.
oh, how humbly and abjectly must i reckon of myself
how must i weigh it as nothing
if i seem to have nothing good
oh, how profoundly ought i to submit myself to thy unfathomable judgments
o lord, when i find myself nothing else save nothing
and again nothing, oh weight unmeasurable
oh ocean which cannot be crossed over
where i find nothing of myself save nothing altogether
where then is the hiding-place of glory
where the confidence begotten of virtue
all vain-glory is swallowed up in the depths of thy judgments against me.
what is all flesh in thy sight
for how shall the clay boast against him that fashioned it
how can he be lifted up in vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to god
the whole world shall not lift him up whom truth hath subdued
nor shall he be moved by the mouth of all who praise him
who hath placed all his hope in god.
for they themselves who speak
behold, they are all nothing
for they shall cease with the sound of their words
but the truth of the lord endureth for ever.
chapter xv
how we must stand and speak, in everything that we desire
my son, speak thou thus in every matter
lord, if it please thee
let this come to pass.
lord, if this shall be for thine honour
let it be done in thy name.
lord, if thou see it good for me
and approve it as useful
then grant me to use it for thy honour.
but if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me
and not profitable for the health of my soul
take the desire away from me
for not every desire is from the holy ghost
although it appear to a man right and good.
it is difficult to judge with certainty whether a good or an evil spirit move thee to desire this or that
or whether thou art moved by thine own spirit.
many have been deceived at the last
who seemed at the beginning to be moved by a good spirit.
therefore, whatsoever seemeth to thee desirable
thou must always desire and seek after it with the fear of god and humility of heart
and most of all, must altogether resign thyself
and commit all unto me and say
lord, thou knowest what is best
let this or that be, according as thou wilt.
give what thou wilt, so much as thou wilt
when thou wilt.
do with me as thou knowest best
and as best shall please thee
and as shall be most to thine honour.
place me where thou wilt
and freely work thy will with me in all things.
i am in thine hand, and turn me in my course.
behold, i am thy servant, ready for all things
for i desire to live not to myself but to thee.
oh, that i might live worthily and perfectly
a prayer to be enabled to do god’s will perfectly
grant me thy grace, most merciful jesus
that it may be with me, and work in me
and persevere with me, even unto the end.
grant that i may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing and dear unto thee.
let thy will be mine
and let my will alway follow thine
and entirely accord with it.
may i choose and reject whatsoever thou dost
yea, let it be impossible for me to choose or reject except according to thy will.
grant that i may die to all worldly things
and for thy sake love to be despised and unknown in this world.
grant unto me, above all things that i can desire
to rest in thee, and that in thee my heart may be at peace.
thou art the true peace of the heart
thou alone its rest, apart from thee all things are hard and unquiet.
in thee alone, the supreme and eternal god
i will lay me down in peace and take my rest.
chapter xvi
that true solace is to be sought in god alone
whatsoever i am able to desire or to think of for my solace
i look for it not here, but hereafter.
for if i alone had all the solaces of this world
and were able to enjoy all its delights
it is certain that they could not endure long.
wherefore, o my soul
thou canst be fully comforted and perfectly refreshed
only in god, the comforter of the poor
and the lifter up of the humble.
wait but a little while, my soul
wait for the divine promise
and thou shalt have abundance of all good things in heaven.
if thou longest too inordinately for the things which are now
thou shalt lose those which are eternal and heavenly.
let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire.
thou canst not be satisfied with any temporal good
for thou wast not created for the enjoyment of these.
although thou hadst all the good things which ever were created
yet couldst not thou be happy and blessed
all thy blessedness and thy felicity lieth in god who created all things
not such felicity as seemeth good to the foolish lover of the world
but such as christ’s good and faithful servants wait for
and as the spiritual and pure in heart sometimes taste
whose conversation is in heaven.
all human solace is empty and short-lived
blessed and true is that solace which is felt inwardly
springing from the truth.
the godly man everywhere beareth about with him his own comforter
jesus, and saith unto him.
be with me, lord jesus, always and everywhere.
let it be my comfort to be able to give up cheerfully all human comfort.
and if thy consolation fail me
let thy will and righteous approval be alway with me for the highest comfort.
for thou wilt not always be chiding
neither keepest thou thine anger for ever
chapter xvii
that all care is to be cast upon god
my son, suffer me to do with thee what i will
i know what is expedient for thee.
thou thinkest as a man
in many things thou judgest as human affection persuadeth thee
lord, what thou sayest is true.
greater is thy care for me than all the care which i am able to take for myself.
for too insecurely doth he stand who casteth not all his care upon thee.
lord, so long as my will standeth right and firm in thee
do with me what thou wilt
for whatsoever thou shalt do with me cannot be aught but good.
blessed be thou if thou wilt leave me in darkness
blessed also be thou if thou wilt leave me in light.
blessed be thou if thou vouchsafe to comfort me
and always blessed be thou if thou cause me to be troubled.
my son, even thus thou must stand if thou desirest to walk with me.
thou must be ready alike for suffering or rejoicing.
thou must be poor and needy as willingly as full and rich
lord, i will willingly bear for thee whatsoever thou wilt have to come upon me.
without choice i will receive from thy hand good and evil
sweet and bitter, joy and sadness
and will give thee thanks for all things which shall happen unto me.
keep me from all sin, and i will not fear death nor hell.
only cast me not away for ever, nor blot me out of the book of life.
then no tribulation which shall come upon me shall do me hurt.
chapter xviii
that temporal miseries are to be borne patiently after the example of christ
my son, i came down from heaven for thy salvation
i took upon me thy miseries not of necessity
but drawn by love that thou mightest learn patience and mightest bear temporal miseries without murmuring.
for from the hour of my birth, until my death upon the cross
i ceased not from bearing of sorrow
i had much lack of temporal things
i oftentimes heard many reproaches against myself
i gently bore contradictions and hard words
i received ingratitude for benefits
blasphemies for my miracles, rebukes for my doctrine
lord, because thou wast patient in thy life
herein most of all fulfilling the commandment of thy father
it is well that i, miserable sinner
should patiently bear myself according to thy will
and as long as thou wilt have it so
should bear about with me for my salvation
the burden of this corruptible life.
for although the present life seemeth burdensome
it is nevertheless already made very full of merit through thy grace
and to those who are weak it becometh easier and brighter through thy example and the footsteps of thy saints
but it is also much more full of consolation than it was of old
under the old testament, when the gate of heaven remained shut
and even the way to heaven seemed more obscure when so few cared to seek after the heavenly kingdom.
but not even those who were then just and in the way of salvation were able
before thy passion and the ransom of thy holy death
to enter the kingdom of heaven.
oh what great thanks am i bound to give thee
who hast vouchsafed to show me and all faithful people the good and right way to thine eternal kingdom
for thy way is our way, and by holy patience we walk to thee who art our crown.
if thou hadst not gone before and taught us
who would care to follow.
how far would they have gone backward if they had not beheld thy glorious example
behold we are still lukewarm
though we have heard of thy many signs and discourses
what would become of us if we had not such a light to help us follow thee ?
chapter xix
of bearing injuries, and who shall be approved as truly patient
what sayest thou, my son, cease to complain
consider my suffering and that of my saints.
thou hast not yet resisted unto blood.
it is little which thou sufferest in comparison with those who have suffered so many things
have been so strongly tempted, so grievously troubled
so manywise proved and tried.
thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more grievous sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy lesser ones more easily
and if they seem not to thee little
see that it is not thy impatience which is the cause of this.
but whether they be little or whether they be great
study to bear them all with patience.
so far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently
so far thou dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit
thou shalt also bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained hereunto.
and say not i cannot bear these things from such a man
nor are things of this kind to be borne by me
for he hath done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what i had never thought
but from another i will suffer patiently
such things as i see i ought to suffer
’ foolish is such a thought as this
for it considereth not the virtue of patience
nor by whom that virtue is to be crowned
but it rather weigheth persons and offences against self.
he is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as seemeth right to himself and from whom he pleaseth.
but the truly patient man considereth not by what man he is tried
whether by one above him, or by an equal or inferior
whether by a good and holy man, or a perverse and unworthy
but indifferently from every creature
whatsoever or how often soever adversity happeneth to him
he gratefully accepteth all from the hand of god and counteth it great gain
for with god nothing which is borne for his sake
however small, shall lose its reward.
be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the victory.
without striving thou canst not win the crown of patience
if thou wilt not suffer thou refusest to be crowned.
but if thou desirest to be crowned
strive manfully, endure patiently.
without labour thou drawest not near to rest
nor without fighting comest thou to victory
make possible to me
o lord, by grace what seemeth impossible to me by nature.
thou knowest how little i am able to bear
and how quickly i am cast down when a like adversity riseth up against me.
whatsoever trial of tribulation may come to me
may it become unto me pleasing and acceptable
for to suffer and be vexed for thy sake is exceeding healthful to the soul.
chapter xx
of confession of our infirmity and of the miseries of this life
i will acknowledge my sin unto thee
i will confess to thee, lord, my infirmity.
it is often a small thing which casteth me down and maketh me sad.
i resolve that i will act bravely
but when a little temptation cometh
immediately i am in a great strait.
wonderfully small sometimes is the matter whence a grievous temptation cometh
and whilst i imagine myself safe for a little space
when i am not considering
i find myself often almost overcome by a little puff of wind.
behold, therefore, o lord
my humility and my frailty, which is altogether known to thee.
be merciful unto me, and draw me out of the mire that i sink not
lest i ever remain cast down.
this is what frequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me before thee
that i am so liable to fall
so weak to resist my passions.
and though their assault is not altogether according to my will
it is violent and grievous
and it altogether wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict.
herein is my infirmity made known to me
that hateful fancies always rush in far more easily than they depart.
oh that thou, most mighty god of israel
lover of all faithful souls
wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of thy servant
and give him help in all things whereunto he striveth.
strengthen me with heavenly fortitude
lest the old man, this miserable flesh
not being yet fully subdued to the spirit
prevail to rule over me.
against which i ought to strive so long as i remain in this most miserable life.
oh what a life is this, where tribulations and miseries cease not
where all things are full of snares and of enemies
for when one tribulation or temptation goeth
another cometh
while the former conflict is yet raging others come more in number and unexpected.
and how can the life of man be loved
seeing that it hath so many bitter things
that it is subjected to so many calamities and miseries.
how can it be even called life
when it produces so many deaths and plagues
the world is often reproached because it is deceitful and vain
yet notwithstanding it is not easily given up
because the lusts of the flesh have too much rule over it.
some draw us to love, some to hate.
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes
and the pride of life, these draw to love of the world
but the punishments and miseries which righteously follow these things
bring forth hatred of the world and weariness.
but, alas, an evil desire conquereth a mind given to the world
and thinketh it happiness to be under the nettles because it savoureth not nor perceiveth the sweetness of god nor the inward gracefulness of virtue.
but they who perfectly despise the world and strive to live unto god in holy discipline
these are not ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to all who truly deny themselves and see clearly how grievously the world erreth
and in how many ways it is deceived.
chapter xxi
that we must rest in god above all goods and gifts
above all things and in all things thou shalt rest alway in the lord
o my soul, for he himself is the eternal rest of the saints.
grant me, most sweet and loving jesus
to rest in thee above every creature
above all health and beauty
above all glory and honour
above all power and dignity
above all knowledge and skilfulness
above all riches and arts
above all joy and exultation
above all fame and praise
above all sweetness and consolation
above all hope and promise
above all merit and desire
above all gifts and rewards which thou canst give and pour forth
above all joy and jubilation which the mind is able to receive and feel
in a word, above angels and archangels and all the army of heaven
above all things visible and invisible
and above everything which thou
o my god, art not.
for thou, o lord, my god
art best above all things
thou only art the most high
thou only the almighty
thou only the all-sufficient
and the fulness of all things
thou only the all-delightsome and the all-comforting
thou alone the altogether lovely and altogether loving
thou alone the most exalted and most glorious above all things
in whom all things are, and were, and ever shall be
altogether and all-perfect.
and thus it falleth short and is insufficient whatsoever thou givest to me without thyself or whatsoever thou revealest or dost promise concerning thyself
whilst thou art not seen or fully possessed
since verily my heart cannot truly rest nor be entirely content
except it rest in thee, and go beyond all gifts and every creature.
o my most beloved spouse, jesus christ
most holy lover of my soul
ruler of this whole creation
who shall give me the wings of true liberty
that i may flee to thee and find rest
oh when shall it be given me to be open to receive thee to the full
and to see how sweet thou art
o lord my god
when shall i collect myself altogether in thee
that because of thy love i may not feel myself at all
but may know thee only above every sense and measure
in measure not known to others.
but now i ofttimes groan
and bear my sad estate with sorrow
because many evils befall me in this vale of miseries which continually disturb and fill me with sorrow
and encloud me, continually hinder and fill me with care
allure and entangle me, that i cannot have free access to thee
nor enjoy that sweet intercourse which is always near at hand to the blessed spirits.
let my deep sighing come before thee
and my manifold desolation on the earth.
o jesus, light of eternal glory
solace of the wandering soul
before thee my mouth is without speech
and my silence speaketh to thee.
how long will my lord delay to come unto me
let him come unto me
his poor and humble one
and make me glad.
let him put forth his hand
and deliver his holy one from every snare.
come, oh come, for without thee shall be no joyful day or hour
for thou art my joy, and without thee is my table empty.
i am miserable, and in a manner imprisoned and loaded with fetters
until thou refresh me by the light of thy presence
and give me liberty, and show thy loving countenance.
let others seek some other thing instead of thee
whatsoever it shall please them
but for my part nothing else pleaseth or shall please
save thou, my god, my hope, my eternal salvation.
i will not hold my peace, nor cease to implore
until thy grace return, and until thou speak to me within.
behold, here i am, behold
i come to thee, for thou didst call me.
thy tears and the longing of thy soul
thy humbleness and contrition of heart have inclined me
and brought me to thee, and i said lord
i have called upon thee, and i have longed to enjoy thee
being ready to reject everything for thy sake.
for thou didst first move me to seek thee.
therefore, blessed be thou, o lord
who has wrought this good work upon thy servant
according to the multitude of thy mercy.
what then hath thy servant to say in thy presence
save to humble himself greatly before thee
being alway mindful of his own iniquity and vileness.
for there is none like unto thee in all marvels of heaven and earth.
excellent are thy works, true are thy judgments
and by thy providence are all things governed.
therefore praise and glory be unto thee
o wisdom of the father
let my mouth and my soul and all created things praise and bless thee together.
chapter xxii
of the recollection of god’s manifold benefits
open, o lord, my heart in thy law
and teach me to walk in the way of thy commandments.
grant me to understand thy will and to be mindful of thy benefits
both general and special
with great reverence and diligent meditation
that thus i may be able worthily to give thee thanks.
yet i know and confess that i cannot render thee due praises for the least of thy mercies.
i am less than the least of all the good things which thou gavest me
and when i consider thy majesty
my spirit faileth because of the greatness thereof.
all things which we have in the soul and in the body
and whatsoever things we possess
whether outwardly or inwardly
naturally or supernaturally
are thy good gifts, and prove thee
from whom we have received them all
to be good, gentle and kind.
although one receiveth many things
and another fewer, yet all are thine
and without thee not even the least thing can be possessed.
he who hath received greater cannot boast that it is of his own merit
nor lift himself up above others
nor contemn those beneath him
for he is the greater and the better who ascribeth least to himself
and in giving thanks is the humbler and more devout
and he who holdeth himself to be viler than all
and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy
is the apter for receiving greater things.
but he who hath received fewer gifts
ought not to be cast down
nor to take it amiss
nor to envy him who is richer
but rather ought he to look unto thee
and to greatly extol thy goodness
for thou pourest forth thy gifts so richly
so freely and largely
without respect of persons.
all things come of thee
therefore in all things shalt thou be praised.
thou knowest what is best to be given to each
and why this man hath less
and that more is not for us but for thee to understand
for unto thee each man’s deservings are fully known.
wherefore, o lord god
i reckon it even a great benefit, not to have many things
whence praise and glory may appear outwardly
and after the thought of men.
for so it is that he who considereth his own poverty and vileness
ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or sorrow
or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness
because thou, lord, hast chosen the poor and humble
and those who are poor in this world
to be thy friends and acquaintance.
so give all thine apostles witness whom thou hast made princes in all lands.
yet they had their conversation in this world blameless
so humble and meek, without any malice or deceit
that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes for thy name’s sake
and what things the world hateth
they embraced with great joy.
therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth thee and knoweth thy benefits
as thy will in him
and the good pleasure of thine eternal providence
wherewith he ought to be so contented and comforted
that he would as willingly be the least as any other would be the greatest
as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the highest place
and as willingly held of small and low account and of no name or reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world than others.
for thy will and the love of thine honour ought to go before all things
and to please and comfort him more
than all benefits that are given or may be given to himself.
chapter xxiii
of four things which bring great peace
my son, now will i teach thee the way of peace and of true liberty
do, o my lord, as thou sayest
for this is pleasing unto me to hear.
strive, my son, to do another’s will rather than thine own.
choose always to have less rather than more.
seek always after the lowest place
and to be subject to all.
wish always and pray that the will of god be fulfilled in thee.
behold, such a man as this entereth into the inheritance of peace and quietness
o my lord, this thy short discourse hath in itself much of perfectness.
it is short in words but full of meaning
and abundant in fruit.
for if it were possible that i should fully keep it
disturbance would not so easily arise within me.
for as often as i feel myself disquieted and weighed down
i find myself to have gone back from this teaching.
but thou, who art almighty
and always lovest progress in the soul
vouchsafe more grace, that i may be enabled to fulfil thy exhortation
and work out my salvation.
a prayer against evil thoughts
o lord my god, be not thou far from me
my god, haste thee to help me
for many thoughts and great fears have risen up against me
afflicting my soul.
how shall i pass through them unhurt
how shall i break through them ?
i, saith he, will go before thee
and make the crooked places straight
i will open the prison doors
and reveal to thee the secret places.
do, lord, as thou sayest
and let all evil thoughts fly away before thy face.
this is my hope and my only comfort
to fly unto thee in all tribulation
to hope in thee
to call upon thee from my heart and patiently wait for thy loving kindness.
a prayer for enlightenment of the mind
enlighten me, blessed jesus
with the brightness of thy inner light
and cast forth all darkness from the habitation of my heart.
restrain my many wandering thoughts
and carry away the temptations which strive to do me hurt.
fight thou mightily for me
and drive forth the evil beasts
so call i alluring lusts
that peace may be within thy walls and plenteousness of praise within thy palaces
even in my pure conscience.
command thou the winds and the storms
say unto the sea, be still, say unto the stormy wind
hold thy peace, so shall there be a great calm.
oh send forth thy light and thy truth
that they may shine upon the earth
for i am but earth without form and void until thou give me light.
pour forth thy grace from above
water my heart with the dew of heaven
give the waters of devotion to water the face of the earth
and cause it to bring forth good and perfect fruit.
lift up my mind which is oppressed with the weight of sins
and raise my whole desire to heavenly things
that having tasted the sweetness of the happiness which is from above
it may take no pleasure in thinking of things of earth.
draw me and deliver me from every unstable comfort of creatures
for no created thing is able to satisfy my desire and to give me comfort.
join me to thyself by the inseparable bond of love
for thou alone art sufficient to him that loveth thee
and without thee all things are vain toys.
chapter xxiv
of avoiding of curious inquiry into the life of another
my son, be not curious
nor trouble thyself with vain cares.
what is that to thee, follow thou me.
for what is it to thee whether a man be this or that
or say or do thus or thus
thou hast no need to answer for others
but thou must give an answer for thyself.
why therefore dost thou entangle thyself
behold, i know all men
and i behold all things which are done under the sun
and i know how it standeth with each one
what he thinketh, what he willeth
and to what end his thoughts reach.
all things therefore are to be committed to me
watch thou thyself in godly peace
and leave him who is unquiet to be unquiet as he will.
whatsoever he shall do or say
shall come unto him, for he cannot deceive me.
trouble not thyself about the shadow of a great name
nor about the friendship of many
nor about the love of men towards thee.
for these things beget distraction and great sorrows of heart.
my word should speak freely unto thee
and i would reveal secrets
if only thou didst diligently look for my appearing
and didst open unto me the gates of thy heart.
be sober and watch unto prayer
and humble thyself in all things
chapter xxv
wherein firm peace of heart and true profit consist
my son, i have said, peace i leave with you
my peace i give unto you, not as the world giveth give i unto you.
all men desire peace, but all do not care for the things which belong unto true peace.
my peace is with the humble and lowly in heart.
thy peace shall be in much patience.
if thou heardest me, and didst follow my voice
thou shouldest enjoy much peace, what then shall i do, lord ?
in everything take heed to thyself what thou doest
and what thou sayest, and direct all thy purpose to this
that thou please me alone
and desire or seek nothing apart from me.
but, moreover, judge nothing rashly concerning the words or deeds of others
nor meddle with matters which are not committed to thee
and it may be that thou shalt be disturbed little or rarely.
yet never to feel any disquiet
nor to suffer any pain of heart or body
this belongeth not to the present life
but is the state of eternal rest.
therefore count not thyself to have found true peace
if thou hast felt no grief
nor that then all is well if thou hast no adversary
nor that this is perfect if all things fall out according to thy desire.
nor then reckon thyself to be anything great
or think that thou art specially beloved
if thou art in a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit
for not by these things is the true lover of virtue known
nor in them doth the profit and perfection of man consist
in what then, lord ?
in offering thyself with all thy heart to the divine will
in not seeking the things which are thine own
whether great or small, whether temporal or eternal
so that thou remain with the same steady countenance in giving of thanks between prosperity and adversity
weighing all things in an equal balance.
if thou be so brave and long-suffering in hope that when inward comfort is taken from thee
thou even prepare thy heart for the more endurance
and justify not thyself, as though thou oughtest not to suffer these heavy things
but dost justify me in all things that i appoint
and dost bless my holy name
then dost thou walk in the true and right way of peace
and shalt have a sure hope that thou shalt again behold my face with joy.
for if thou come to an utter contempt of thyself
know that then thou shalt enjoy abundance of peace
as much as is possible where thou art but a wayfaring man
chapter xxvi
of the exaltation of a free spirit
which humble prayer more deserveth than doth frequent reading
lord, this is the work of a perfect man
never to slacken his mind from attention to heavenly things
and among many cares to pass along as it were without care
not after the manner of one indifferent
but rather with the privilege of a free mind
cleaving to no creature with inordinate affection.
i beseech thee, my most merciful lord god
preserve me from the cares of this life
lest i become too much entangled
from many necessities of the body
lest i be taken captive by pleasure
from all obstacles of the spirit
lest i be broken and cast down with cares.
i say not from those things which the vanity of the world goeth about after with all eagerness
but from those miseries
which by the universal curse of mortality weigh down and hold back the soul of thy servant in punishment
that it cannot enter into liberty of spirit
so often as it would.
o my god, sweetness unspeakable
turn into bitterness all my fleshly consolation
which draweth me away from the love of eternal things
and wickedly allureth toward itself by setting before me some present delight.
let not, o my god, let not flesh and blood prevail over me
let not the world and its short glory deceive me
let not the devil and his craftiness supplant me.
give me courage to resist, patience to endure
constancy to persevere.
grant, in place of all consolations of the world
the most sweet unction of thy spirit, and in place of carnal love
pour into me the love of thy name.
behold, food and drink and clothing
and all the other needs appertaining to the support of the body
are burdensome to the devout spirit.
grant that i may use such things with moderation
and that i be not entangled with inordinate affection for them.
to cast away all these things is not lawful
because nature must be sustained
but to require superfluities and things which merely minister delight
the holy law forbiddeth, for otherwise the flesh would wax insolent against the spirit.
in all these things, i beseech thee
let thy hand guide and teach me, that i in no way exceed.
chapter xxvii
that personal love greatly hindereth from the highest good
my son, thou must give all for all, and be nothing of thine own.
know thou that the love of thyself is more hurtful to thee than anything in the world.
according to the love and inclination which thou hast
everything more or less cleaveth to thee.
if thy love be pure, sincere, well-regulated
thou shalt not be in captivity to anything.
do not covet what thou mayest not have
do not have what is able to hinder thee
and to rob thee of inward liberty.
it is wonderful that thou committest not thyself to me from the very bottom of thy heart
with all things which thou canst desire or have.
why art thou consumed with vain sorrow
why art thou wearied with superfluous cares
stand thou by my good pleasure
and thou shalt suffer no loss.
if thou seekest after this or that
and wilt be here or there
according to thine own advantage or the fulfilling of thine own pleasure
thou shalt never be in quiet, nor free from care
because in everything somewhat will be found lacking
and everywhere there will be somebody who opposeth thee.
therefore it is not gaining or multiplying of this thing or that which advantageth thee
but rather the despising it and cutting it by the root out of thy heart
which thou must not only understand of money and riches
but of the desire after honour and vain praise
things which all pass away with the world.
the place availeth little if the spirit of devotion is wanting
nor shall that peace stand long which is sought from abroad
if the state of thy heart is without the true foundation
that is, if it abide not in me.
thou mayest change, but thou canst not better thyself
for when occasion ariseth and is accepted thou shalt find what thou didst fly from
yea more
a prayer for cleansing of the heart and for heavenly wisdom
strengthen me, o god
by the grace of thy holy spirit.
give me virtue to be strengthened with might in the inner man
and to free my heart from all fruitless care and trouble
and that i be not drawn away by various desires after any things whatsoever
whether of little value or great
but that i may look upon all as passing away
and myself as passing away with them
because there is no profit under the sun
and all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
oh how wise is he that considereth thus
give me, o lord, heavenly wisdom
that i may learn to seek thee above all things and to find thee
to relish thee above all things and to love thee
and to understand all other things
even as they are, according to the order of thy wisdom.
grant me prudently to avoid the flatterer
and patiently to bear with him that opposeth me
for this is great wisdom
not to be carried by every wind of words
nor to give ear to the wicked flattering siren
for thus do we go safely on in the way we have begun.
chapter xxviii
against the tongues of detractors
my son, take it not sadly to heart
if any think ill of thee
and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear.
thou oughtest to think worse of thyself
and to believe no man weaker than thyself.
if thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying words above their value.
it is no small prudence to keep silence in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto me
and not to be troubled by human judgment.
let not thy peace depend upon the word of men
for whether they judge well or ill of thee
thou art not therefore any other man than thyself.
where is true peace or true glory
is it not in me, and he who seeketh not to please men
nor feareth to displease, shall enjoy abundant peace.
from inordinate love and vain fear ariseth all disquietude of heart
and all distraction of the senses
chapter xxix
how when tribulation cometh we must call upon and bless god
blessed be thy name, o lord, for evermore
who hast willed this temptation and trouble to come upon me.
i cannot escape it, but have need to flee unto thee
that thou mayest succour me and turn it unto me for good.
lord, now am i in tribulation, and it is not well within my heart
but i am sore vexed by the suffering which lieth upon me.
and now, o dear father, what shall i say
i am taken among the snares.
save me from this hour, but for this cause came i unto this hour
that thou mightest be glorified when i am deeply humbled and am delivered through thee.
let it be thy pleasure to deliver me
for what can i do who am poor
and without thee whither shall i go
give patience this time also.
help me, o lord my god, and i will not fear how much soever i be weighed down.
and now amid these things what shall i say
lord, thy will be done.
i have well deserved to be troubled and weighed down.
therefore i ought to bear, would that it be with patience
until the tempest be overpast and comfort return.
yet is thine omnipotent arm able also to take this temptation away from me
and to lessen its power that i fall not utterly under it
even as many a time past thou has helped me
o god, my merciful god.
and as much as this deliverance is difficult to me
so much is it easy to thee
o right hand of the most highest.
chapter xxx
of seeking divine help, and the confidence of obtaining grace
my son, i the lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.
come unto me, when it is not well with thee.
this it is which chiefly hindereth heavenly consolation
that thou too slowly betakest thyself unto prayer.
for before thou earnestly seekest unto me
thou dost first seek after many means of comfort
and refresheth thyself in outward things
so it cometh to pass that all things profit thee but little until thou learn that it is i who deliver those who trust in me
neither beside me is there any strong help
nor profitable counsel, nor enduring remedy.
but now, recovering courage after the tempest
grow thou strong in the light of my mercies
for i am nigh, saith the lord
that i may restore all things not only as they were at the first
but also abundantly and one upon another.
for is anything too hard for me
or shall i be like unto one who saith and doeth not
where is thy faith, stand fast and with perseverance.
be long-suffering and strong.
consolation will come unto thee in its due season.
wait for me, yea, wait
i will come and heal thee.
it is temptation which vexeth thee
and a vain fear which terrifieth thee.
what doth care about future events bring thee
save sorrow upon sorrow
sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
it is vain and useless to be disturbed or lifted up about future things which perhaps will never come.
but it is the nature of man to be deceived by fancies of this sort
and it is a sign of a mind which is still weak to be so easily drawn away at the suggestion of the enemy.
for he careth not whether he deceive and beguile by true means or false
whether he throw thee down by the love of the present or fear of the future.
therefore let not thy heart be troubled
neither let it be afraid.
believe in me, and put thy trust in my mercy.
when thou thinkest thyself far removed from me
i am often the nearer.
when thou reckonest that almost all is lost
then often is greater opportunity of gain at hand.
all is not lost when something goeth contrary to thy wishes.
thou oughtest not to judge according to present feeling
nor so to take or give way to any grief which befalleth thee
as if all hope of escape were taken away.
think not thyself totally abandoned
although for the time i have sent to thee some tribulation
or have even withdrawn some cherished consolation
for this is the way to the kingdom of heaven.
and without doubt it is better for thee and for all my other servants
that ye should be proved by adversities
than that ye should have all things as ye would.
i know thy hidden thoughts
and that it is very needful for thy soul’s health that sometimes thou be left without relish
lest perchance thou be lifted up by prosperity
and desirous to please thyself in that which thou art not.
what i have given i am able to take away
and to restore again at my good pleasure.
when i shall have given
it is mine, when i shall have taken away
i have not taken what is thine
for every good gift and every perfect gift is from me.
if i shall have sent upon thee grief or any vexation
be not angry, nor let thy heart be sad
i am able quickly to lift thee up and to change every burden into joy.
but i am just and greatly to be praised
when i do thus unto thee.
if thou rightly consider, and look upon it with truth
thou oughtest never to be so sadly cast down because of adversity
but rather shouldst rejoice and give thanks
yea, verily to count it the highest joy that i afflict thee with sorrows and spare thee not.
as my father hath loved me, so love i you
thus have i spoken unto my beloved disciples
whom i sent forth not unto worldly joys
but to great strivings, not unto honours, but unto contempt
not unto ease, but to labours, not unto rest
but to bring forth much fruit with patience.
my son, remember these words
chapter xxxi
of the neglect of every creature
that the creator may be found
o lord, i still need more grace
if i would arrive where neither man nor any other creature may hinder me.
for so long as anything keepeth me back
i cannot freely fly unto thee.
he desired eagerly thus to fly
who cried, saying, oh that i had wings like a dove
for then would i flee away and be at rest.
what is more peaceful than the single eye
and what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth
therefore must a man rise above every creature
and perfectly forsake himself
and with abstracted mind to stand and behold that thou
the creator of all things
hast among thy creatures nothing like unto thyself.
and except a man be freed from all creatures
he will not be able to reach freely after divine things.
therefore few are found who give themselves to contemplation
because few know how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created things.
for this much grace is necessary
which may lift up the soul and raise it above itself.
and except a man be lifted up in the spirit
and freed from all creatures
and altogether united to god
whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath
it mattereth but little.
he who esteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal, good
shall long time be little and lie low.
for whatsoever is not god is nothing
and ought to be counted for nothing.
great is the difference between a godly man
illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge and given to books.
far nobler is that doctrine which floweth down from the divine fulness above
than that which is acquired laboriously by human study.
many are found who desire contemplation
but they do not strive to practice those things which are required thereunto.
it is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs
and too little of thorough mortification.
i know not how it is, and by what spirit we are led
and what we who would be deemed spiritual are aiming at
that we give so great labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless things
and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at all of our inward condition.
forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors
and do not subject our actions to a strict examination.
where our affections are set we take no heed
and we weep not that all things belonging to us are so defiled.
for because all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth
the great deluge came.
since therefore our inmost affections are very corrupt
it followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt
being the index of a deficient inward strength.
out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living.
we demand, how much a man hath done
but from how much virtue he acted
is not so narrowly considered.
we ask if he be strong, rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer
good singer, good workman, but how poor he may be in spirit
how patient and gentle, how devout and meditative
on these things many are silent.
nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man
grace turneth its thought to the heart.
the former frequently judgeth amiss
the latter trusteth in god
that it may not be deceived.
chapter xxxii
of self-denial and the casting away all selfishness
my son, thou canst not possess perfect liberty unless thou altogether deny thyself.
all they are enslaved who are possessors of riches
they who love themselves, the selfish, the curious, the restless
those who ever seek after soft things
and not after the things of jesus christ
those who continually plan and devise that which will not stand.
for whatsoever cometh not of god shall perish.
hold fast the short and complete saying
renounce all things, and thou shalt find all things
give up thy lust, and thou shalt find rest
’ dwell upon this in thy mind
and when thou art full of it
thou shalt understand all things
o lord, this is not the work of a day, nor children’s play
verily in this short saying is enclosed all the perfection of the religious.
my son, thou oughtest not to be turned aside
nor immediately cast down
because thou hast heard the way of the perfect.
rather oughtest thou to be provoked to higher aims
and at the least to long after the desire thereof.
oh that it were so with thee
and that thou hadst come to this
that thou wert not a lover of thine own self
but wert ready always to my nod
and to his whom i have placed over thee as thy father.
then shouldest thou please me exceedingly
and all thy life should go on in joy and peace.
thou hast still many things to renounce
which if thou resign not utterly to me
thou shalt not gain what thou seekest.
i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
that thou mayest be rich, that is heavenly wisdom
which despiseth all base things.
put away from thee earthly wisdom
and all pleasure, whether common to men, or thine own.
i tell thee that thou must buy vile things with those which are costly and great in the esteem of men.
for wonderfully vile and small
and almost given up to forgetfulness
doth true heavenly wisdom appear
which thinketh not high things of itself
nor seeketh to be magnified upon the earth
many honour it with their lips
but in heart are far from it
it is indeed the precious pearl
which is hidden from many
chapter xxxiii
of instability of the heart
and of directing the aim towards god
my son, trust not thy feeling
for that which is now will be quickly changed into somewhat else.
as long as thou livest thou art subject to change
howsoever unwilling, so that thou art found now joyful
but the wise man, and he who is truly learned in spirit
standeth above these changeable things
attentive not to what he may feel in himself
or from what quarter the wind may blow
but that the whole intent of his mind may carry him on to the due and much-desired end.
for thus will he be able to remain one and the same and unshaken
the single eye of his desire being steadfastly fixed
through the manifold changes of the world, upon me.
but according as the eye of intention be the more pure
even so will a man make his way steadfastly through the manifold storms.
but in many the eye of pure intention waxeth dim
for it quickly resteth itself upon anything pleasant which occurreth
and rarely is any man found altogether free from the blemish of self-seeking.
so the jews of old came to bethany, to the house of martha and mary
that they might see not jesus, but lazarus
whom he had raised from the dead.
therefore must the eye of the intention be cleansed
that it may be single and right
and above all things which come in its way
may be directed unto me
chapter xxxiv
that to him who loveth god is sweet above all things and in all things
behold, god is mine, and all things are mine
what will i more, and what more happy thing can i desire
o delightsome and sweet world
that is, to him that loveth the word
not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
my god, my all, to him that understandeth
that word sufficeth, and to repeat it often is pleasing to him that loveth it.
when thou art present all things are pleasant
when thou art absent, all things are wearisome.
thou makest the heart to be at rest
givest it deep peace and festal joy.
thou makest it to think rightly in every matter
and in every matter to give thee praise
neither can anything please long without thee but if it would be pleasant and of sweet savour
thy grace must be there
and it is thy wisdom which must give unto it a sweet savour.
to him who tasteth thee, what can be distasteful
and to him who tasteth thee not
what is there which can make him joyous
but the worldly wise, and they who enjoy the flesh
these fail in thy wisdom
for in the wisdom of the world is found utter vanity
and to be carnally minded is death.
but they who follow after thee through contempt of worldly things
and mortification of the flesh
are found to be truly wise because they are carried from vanity to verity
from the flesh to the spirit.
they taste that the lord is good
and whatsoever good they find in creatures
they count it all unto the praise of the creator.
unlike, yea, very unlike is the enjoyment of the creator to enjoyment of the creature
the enjoyment of eternity and of time
of light uncreated and of light reflected.
o light everlasting, surpassing all created lights
dart down thy ray from on high which shall pierce the inmost depths of my heart.
give purity, joy, clearness
life to my spirit that with all its powers it may cleave unto thee with rapture passing man’s understanding.
oh when shall that blessed and longed-for time come when thou shalt satisfy me with thy presence
and be unto me all in all, so long as this is delayed, my joy shall not be full.
still, ah me, the old man liveth in me
he is not yet all crucified, not yet quite dead
still he lusteth fiercely against the spirit
wageth inward wars
nor suffereth the soul’s kingdom to be in peace.
but thou who rulest the raging of the sea
and stillest the waves thereof when they arise
rise up and help me.
scatter the people that delight in war.
destroy them by thy power.
show forth, i beseech thee, thy might
and let thy right hand be glorified
for i have no hope, no refuge
save in thee, o lord my god.
chapter xxxv
that there is no security against temptation in this life
my son, thou art never secure in this life
but thy spiritual armour will always be needful for thee as long as thou livest.
thou dwellest among foes
and art attacked on the right hand and on the left.
if therefore thou use not on all sides the shield of patience
thou wilt not remain long unwounded.
above all, if thou keep not thy heart fixed upon me with steadfast purpose to bear all things for my sake
thou shalt not be able to bear the fierceness of the attack
nor to attain to the victory of the blessed.
therefore must thou struggle bravely all thy life through
and put forth a strong hand against those things which oppose thee.
for to him that overcometh is the hidden manna given
but great misery is reserved for the slothful.
if thou seek rest in this life
how then wilt thou attain unto the rest which is eternal
set not thyself to attain much rest, but much patience.
seek the true peace, not in earth but in heaven
not in man nor in any created thing, but in god alone.
for the love of god thou must willingly undergo all things
whether labours or sorrows, these things help unto virtue
these things prove the scholar of christ
these things fashion the heavenly crown.
i will give thee an eternal reward for short labour
and infinite glory for transient shame.
thinkest thou that thou shalt always have spiritual consolations at thy will
my saints had never such, but instead thereof manifold griefs
and divers temptations, and heavy desolations.
but patiently they bore themselves in all
and trusted in god more than in themselves
knowing that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
wouldst thou have that immediately which many have hardly attained unto after many tears and hard labours
wait for the lord, quit thyself like a man and be strong
be not faint-hearted, nor go aside from me
but constantly devote thy body and soul to the glory of god.
i will reward thee plenteously, i will be with thee in trouble
chapter xxxvi
against vain judgments of men
my son, anchor thy soul firmly upon god
and fear not man’s judgment
when conscience pronounceth thee pious and innocent.
it is good and blessed thus to suffer
nor will it be grievous to the heart which is humble
and which trusteth in god more than in itself.
many men have many opinions
and therefore little trust is to be placed in them.
but moreover it is impossible to please all.
although paul studied to please all men in the lord
and to become all things to all men
yet nevertheless with him it was a very small thing that he should be judged by man’s judgment
he laboured abundantly, as much as in him lay
for the building up and the salvation of others
but he could not avoid being sometimes judged and despised by others.
therefore he committed all to god
who knew all, and by patience and humility defended himself against evil speakers
or foolish and false thinkers
and those who accused him according to their pleasure.
nevertheless, from time to time he replied
lest his silence should become a stumbling-block to those who were weak.
who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die
to-day he is, and to-morrow his place is not found.
fear god and thou shalt not quail before the terrors of men.
what can any man do against thee by words or deeds
he hurteth himself more than thee
nor shall he escape the judgment of god
whosoever he may be.
have thou god before thine eyes
and do not contend with fretful words.
and if for the present thou seem to give way
and to suffer confusion which thou hast not deserved
be not angry at this
nor by impatience diminish thy reward
but rather look up to me in heaven
for i am able to deliver thee from all confusion and hurt
and to render to every man according to his works
chapter xxxvii
of pure and entire resignation of self
for the obtaining liberty of heart
my son, lose thyself and thou shalt find me.
stand still without all choosing and all thought of self
and thou shalt ever be a gainer.
for more grace shall be added to thee
as soon as thou resignest thyself
and so long as thou dost not turn back to take thyself again
o lord, how often shall i resign myself
and in what things shall i lose myself ?
always, every hour, in that which is little
and in that which is great.
i make no exception
but will that thou be found naked in all things.
otherwise how canst thou be mine and i thine
unless thou be inwardly and outwardly free from every will of thine own
the sooner thou dost this, the better shall it be with thee
and the more fully and sincerely
the more thou shalt please me
and the more abundantly shalt thou be rewarded.
some resign themselves, but with certain reservations
for they do not fully trust in god
therefore they think that they have some provision to make for themselves.
some again at first offer everything
but afterwards being pressed by temptation they return to their own devices
and thus make no progress in virtue.
they will not attain to the true liberty of a pure heart
nor to the grace of my sweet companionship
unless they first entirely resign themselves and daily offer themselves up as a sacrifice
without this the union which bringeth forth fruit standeth not nor will stand.
many a time i have said unto thee
and now say again, give thyself up
resign thyself, and thou shalt have great inward peace.
give all for all, demand nothing
ask nothing in return, stand simply and with no hesitation in me
and thou shalt possess me.
thou shalt have liberty of heart
and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee.
for this strive thou, pray for it, long after it
that thou mayest be delivered from all possession of thyself
and nakedly follow jesus who was made naked for thee
mayest die unto thyself and live eternally to me.
then shall all vain fancies disappear
all evil disturbings, and superfluous cares.
then also shall immoderate fear depart from thee
and inordinate love shall die
chapter xxxviii
of a good government in external things
and of having recourse to god in dangers
my son, for this thou must diligently make thy endeavour
that in every place and outward action or occupation thou mayest be free within
and have power over thyself, and that all things be under thee
not thou under them, that thou be master and ruler of thy actions
not a slave or hireling, but rather a free and true hebrew
entering into the lot and the liberty of the children of god
who stand above the present and look upon the eternal
who with the left eye behold things transitory
and with the right things heavenly
whom temporal things draw not to cleave unto
but who rather draw temporal things to do them good service
even as they were ordained of god to do
and appointed by the master workman
who hath left nought in his creation without aim and end.
and if in any chance of life thou stand not in outward appearances
nor judgest things which are seen and heard by the fleshly sense
but straightway in every cause enterest with moses into the tabernacle to ask counsel of god
thou shalt hear a divine response and come forth instructed concerning many things that are and shall be.
for always moses had recourse to the tabernacle for the solving of all doubts and questionings
and fled to the help of prayer to be delivered from the dangers and evil deeds of men.
thus also oughtest thou to fly to the secret chamber of thy heart
and earnestly implore the divine succour.
for this cause we read that joshua and the children of israel were deceived by the gibeonites
that they asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord
but being too ready to listen to fair speeches
were deceived by pretended piety
chapter xxxix
that man must not be immersed in business
my son, always commit thy cause to me
i will dispose it aright in due time.
wait for my arrangement of it
and then thou shalt find it for thy profit
o lord, right freely i commit all things to thee
for my planning can profit but little.
oh that i did not dwell so much on future events
but could offer myself altogether to thy pleasures without delay.
my son, a man often striveth vehemently after somewhat which he desireth
but when he hath obtained it he beginneth to be of another mind
because his affections towards it are not lasting
but rather rush on from one thing to another.
therefore it is not really a small thing
when in small things we resist self
the true progress of man lieth in self-denial
and a man who denieth himself is free and safe.
but the old enemy, opposer of all good things
ceaseth not from temptation
but day and night setteth his wicked snares
if haply he may be able to entrap the unwary.
watch and pray, saith the lord
lest ye enter into temptation.
chapter xl
that man hath no good in himself
and nothing whereof to glory
lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him
or the son of man that thou visitest him
what hath man deserved, that thou shouldest bestow thy favour upon him
lord, what cause can i have of complaint
if thou forsake me, or what can i justly allege
if thou refuse to hear my petition
of a truth, this i may truly think and say
lord, i am nothing, i have nothing that is good of myself
but i fall short in all things, and ever tend unto nothing.
and unless i am helped by thee and inwardly supported
i become altogether lukewarm and reckless.
but thou, o lord, art always the same
and endurest for ever, always good, righteous, and holy
doing all things well, righteously, and holily
and disposing all in thy wisdom.
but i who am more ready to go forward than backward
never continue in one stay
because changes sevenfold pass over me.
yet it quickly becometh better when it so pleaseth thee
and thou puttest forth thy hand to help me
because thou alone canst aid without help of man
and canst so strengthen me that my countenance shall be no more changed
but my heart shall be turned to thee
and rest in thee alone.
wherefore, if i but knew well how to reject all human consolations
whether for the sake of gaining devotion
or because of the necessity by which i was compelled to seek thee
seeing there is no man who can comfort me
then could i worthily trust in thy grace
and rejoice in the gift of new consolation.
thanks be to thee, from whom all cometh
whensoever it goeth well with me
but i am vanity and nothing in thy sight
a man inconstant and weak.
what then have i whereof to glory
or why do i long to be held in honour
is it not for nought, this also is utterly vain.
verily vain glory is an evil plague
the greatest of vanities
because it draweth us away from the true glory
and robbeth us of heavenly grace.
for whilst a man pleaseth himself he displeaseth thee
whilst he gapeth after the praises of man
he is deprived of true virtues.
but true glory and holy rejoicing lieth in glorying in thee and not in self
in rejoicing in thy name, not in our own virtue
in not taking delight in any creature
save only for thy sake.
let thy name, not mine be praised
let thy work, not mine be magnified
let thy holy name be blessed
but to me let nought be given of the praises of men.
thou art my glory, thou art the joy of my heart.
in thee will i make my boast and be glad all the day long
but for myself let me not glory save only in my infirmities.
let the jews seek the honour which cometh from one another
but i will ask for that which cometh from god only.
truly all human glory, all temporal honour, all worldly exultation
compared to thy eternal glory, is but vanity and folly.
o god my truth and my mercy
blessed trinity, to thee alone be all praise, honour, power, and glory for ever and for ever.
chapter xli
of contempt of all temporal honour
my son, make it no matter of thine
if thou see others honoured and exalted
and thyself despised and humbled.
lift up thine heart to me in heaven
and then the contempt of men upon earth will not make thee sad
o lord, we are in blindness
and are quickly seduced by vanity.
if i look rightly within myself
never was injury done unto me by any creature
and therefore i have nought whereof to complain before thee.
but because i have many times and grievously sinned against thee
all creatures do justly take arms against me.
therefore to me confusion and contempt are justly due
but to thee praise and honour and glory.
and except i dispose myself for this
namely, to be willing that every creature should despise and desert me
and that i should be esteemed altogether as nothing
i cannot be inwardly filled with peace and strength
nor spiritually enlightened
nor fully united to thee.
chapter xlii
that our peace is not to be placed in men
my son, if thou set thy peace on any person because thou hast high opinion of him
and art familiar with him
thou shalt be unstable and entangled.
but if thou betake thyself to the ever-living and abiding truth
the desertion or death of a friend shall not make thee sad.
in me ought the love of thy friend to subsist
and for my sake is every one to be loved
whosoever he be, who appeareth to thee good
and is very dear to thee in this life.
without me friendship hath no strength or endurance
neither is that love true and pure
which i unite not.
thou oughtest to be so dead to such affections of beloved friends
that as far as in thee lieth
thou wouldst rather choose to be without any companionship of men.
the nearer a man approacheth to god
the further he recedeth from all earthly solace.
the deeper also he descendeth into himself
and the viler he appeareth in his own eyes
the higher he ascendeth towards god.
but he who attributeth anything good to himself
hindereth the grace of god from coming to him
because the grace of the holy ghost ever seeketh the humble heart.
if thou couldst make thyself utterly nothing
and empty thyself of the love of every creature
then should it be my part to overflow unto thee with great grace.
when thou settest thine eyes upon creatures
the face of the creator is withdrawn from thee.
learn in all things to conquer thyself for thy creator’s sake
then shalt thou be able to attain unto divine knowledge.
how small soever anything be, if it be loved and regarded inordinately
it holdeth us back from the highest good, and corrupteth
chapter xliii
against vain and worldly knowledge
my son, let not the fair and subtle sayings of men move thee.
for the kingdom of god is not in word, but in power.
give ear to my words, for they kindle the heart and enlighten the mind
they bring contrition, and they supply manifold consolations.
never read thou the word that thou mayest appear more learned or wise
but study for the mortification of thy sins
for this will be far more profitable for thee than the knowledge of many difficult questions.
when thou hast read and learned many things
thou must always return to one first principle.
i am he that teacheth man knowledge
and i give unto babes clearer knowledge than can be taught by man.
he to whom i speak will be quickly wise and shall grow much in the spirit.
woe unto them who inquire into many curious questions from men
and take little heed concerning the way of my service.
the time will come when christ will appear
the master of masters, the lord of the angels
to hear the lessons of all
that is to examine the consciences of each one.
and then will he search jerusalem with candles
and the hidden things of darkness shall be made manifest
and the arguings of tongues shall be silent.
i am he who in an instant lift up the humble spirit
to learn more reasonings of the eternal truth
than if a man had studied ten years in the schools.
i teach without noise of words
without confusion of opinions
without striving after honour
without clash of arguments.
i am he who teach men to despise earthly things
to loathe things present
to seek things heavenly
to enjoy things eternal, to flee honours, to endure offences
to place all hope in me, to desire nothing apart from me
and above all things to love me ardently.
for there was one, who by loving me from the bottom of his heart
learned divine things, and spake things that were wonderful
he profited more by forsaking all things than by studying subtleties.
but to some i speak common things
to others special, to some i appear gently in signs and figures
and again to some i reveal mysteries in much light.
the voice of books is one, but it informeth not all alike
because i inwardly am the teacher of truth
the searcher of the heart, the discerner of the thoughts
the mover of actions, distributing to each man, as i judge meet
chapter xliv
of not troubling ourselves about outward things
my son, in many things it behoveth thee to be ignorant
and to esteem thyself as one dead upon the earth
and as one to whom the whole world is crucified.
many things also thou must pass by with deaf ear
and must rather think upon those things which belong unto thy peace.
it is more profitable to turn away thine eyes from those things that displease
and to leave each man to his own opinion
than to give thyself to discourses of strife.
if thou stand well with god and hast his judgment in thy mind
thou wilt verily easily bear to be as one conquered
o lord, to what have we come
behold a temporal loss is mourned over
for a trifling gain we labour and hurry
and spiritual loss passeth away into forgetfulness
and we rarely recover it.
that which profiteth little or nothing is looked after
and that which is altogether necessary is negligently passed by
because the whole man slideth away to outward things
and unless he quickly recovereth himself in outward things he willingly lieth down.
chapter xlv
that we must not believe everyone
and that we are prone to fall in our words
lord, be thou my help in trouble
for vain is the help of man.
how often have i failed to find faithfulness
where i thought i possessed it.
how many times i have found it where i least expected.
vain therefore is hope in men
but the salvation of the just
o god, is in thee.
blessed be thou
o lord my god
in all things which happen unto us.
we are weak and unstable
we are quickly deceived and quite changed.
who is the man who is able to keep himself so warily and circumspectly as not sometimes to come into some snare of perplexity
but he who trusteth in thee
o lord, and seeketh thee with an unfeigned heart
doth not so easily slip.
and if he fall into any tribulation
howsoever he may be entangled
yet very quickly he shall be delivered through thee
or by thee shall be comforted
because thou wilt not forsake him that trusteth in thee unto the end.
a friend who continueth faithful in all the distresses of his friend is rare to be found.
thou, o lord, thou alone art most faithful in all things
and there is none other like unto thee.
oh, how truly wise was that holy soul which said
my mind is steadfastly fixed
and it is grounded in christ
if thus it were with me, the fear of man should not so easily tempt me
nor the arrows of words move me.
who is sufficient to foresee all things
who to guard beforehand against future ills
if even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us
what can things which are not foreseen do
but grievously injure
but wherefore have i not better provided for myself
miserable that i am
why, too, have i given such heed to others
but we are men, nor are we other than frail men
even though by many we are reckoned and called angels.
whom shall i trust, o lord
whom shall i trust but thee
thou art the truth, and deceivest not, nor canst be deceived.
and on the other hand, every man is a liar, weak, unstable and frail, especially in his words
so that one ought scarcely ever to believe what seemeth to sound right on the face of it.
with what wisdom hast thou warned us beforehand to beware of men
and that a man’s foes are they of his own household
and that we must not believe if one say unto us lo here, or lo there.
i have been taught by my loss
and o that i may prove more careful and not foolish hereby.
be cautious, saith some one, be cautious
keep unto thyself what i tell thee
and whilst i am silent and believe that it is hid with me
he himself cannot keep silence concerning it
but straightway betrayeth me and himself
and goeth his way.
protect me, o lord, from such mischief-making and reckless men
let me not fall into their hands, nor ever do such things myself.
put a true and steadfast word into my mouth
and remove a deceitful tongue far from me.
what i would not suffer
i ought by all means to beware of doing.
oh, how good and peacemaking a thing it is to be silent concerning others
and not carelessly to believe all reports
nor to hand them on further
how good also to lay one’s self open to few
to seek ever to have thee as the beholder of the heart
not to be carried about with every wind of words
but to desire that all things inward and outward be done according to the good pleasure of thy will
how safe for the preserving of heavenly grace to fly from human approval
and not to long after the things which seem to win admiration abroad
but to follow with all earnestness those things which bring amendment of life and heavenly fervour
how many have been injured by their virtue being made known and too hastily praised.
how truly profitable hath been grace preserved in silence in this frail life
which, as we are told, is all temptation and warfare.
chapter xlvi
of having confidence in god when evil words are cast at us
my son, stand fast and believe in me.
for what are words but words, they fly through the air
but they bruise no stone.
if thou are guilty, think how thou wouldst gladly amend thyself
if thou knowest nothing against thyself
consider that thou wilt gladly bear this for god’s sake.
it is little enough that thou sometimes hast to bear hard words
for thou art not yet able to bear hard blows.
and wherefore do such trivial matters go to thine heart
except that thou art yet carnal
and regardest men more than thou oughtest
for because thou fearest to be despised
thou art unwilling to be reproved for thy faults
and seekest paltry shelters of excuses.
but look better into thyself
and thou shalt know that the world is still alive in thee
and the vain love of pleasing men.
for when thou fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults
it is plain that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world
and that the world is not crucified to thee.
but hearken to my word, and thou shalt not care for ten thousand words of men.
behold, if all things could be said against thee which the utmost malice could invent
what should it hurt thee if thou wert altogether to let it go
and make no more account of it than of a mote
could it pluck out a single hair of thy head ?
but he that hath no heart within him
and hath not god before his eyes
is easily moved by a word of reproach
but he who trusteth in me
and seeketh not to abide by his own judgment
shall be free from the fear of men.
for i am the judge and the discerner of all secrets
i know how the thing hath been done
i know both the injurer and the bearer.
from me went forth that word
by my permission this hath happened
that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
i shall judge the guilty and the innocent
but beforehand i have willed to try them both by a secret judgment.
the testimony of men often deceiveth.
my judgment is true, it will stand
and it shall not be overturned.
it commonly lieth hid, and only to few in certain cases is it made known
yet it never erreth, nor can err,
although it seem not right to the eyes of foolish men.
to me, therefore, must men have recourse in all judgment
and must not lean to their opinion.
for there shall no evil happen to the just
whatsoever may be sent to him by god.
even though some unjust charge be brought against him
he will care little, nor, again
will he exult above measure
if through others he be clearly vindicated.
for he considereth that i am he who try the hearts and reins
who judge not outwardly and according to human appearance
for often in mine eyes that is found blameworthy which in the judgment of men is held worthy of praise
o lord god, o judge, just, strong, and patient
who knowest the frailty and sinfulness of men
be thou my strength and my whole confidence
for my own conscience sufficeth me not.
thou knowest what i know not
and therefore ought i under all rebuke to humble myself
and to bear it meekly.
therefore mercifully forgive me as often as i have not done this
and grant me the next time the grace of greater endurance.
for better unto me is thine abundant pity for the attainment of thy pardon
than the righteousness which i believe myself to have for defence against my conscience
which lieth wait against me.
although i know nothing against myself
yet i am not hereby justified
because if thy mercy were removed away
in thy sight should no man living be justified.
chapter xlvii
that all troubles are to be endured for the sake of eternal life
my son, let not the labours which thou hast undertaken for me break thee down
nor let tribulations cast thee down in any wise
but let my promise strengthen and comfort thee in every event.
i am sufficient to reward thee above all measure and extent.
not long shalt thou labour here
nor always be weighed down with sorrows.
wait yet a little while
and thou shalt see a speedy end of thine evils.
an hour shall come when all labour and confusion shall cease.
little and short is all that passeth away with time.
do earnestly what thou dost
labour faithfully in my vineyard
i will be thy reward.
eternal life is worthy of all these conflicts, and of greater.
peace shall come in one day which is known to the lord
which shall be neither day nor night, but light eternal, infinite clearness, steadfast peace, and undisturbed rest.
thou shalt not say then
who shall deliver me from the body of this death
nor cry out, woe is me
for my sojourning is prolonged, because death will be utterly destroyed
and there shall be salvation which can never fail
no more anxiety, happy delight, sweet and noble society.
oh, if thou sawest the unfading crowns of the saints in heaven
and with what great glory they now rejoice
who aforetime were reckoned by this world contemptibly and as it were unworthy of life
truly thou wouldst immediately humble thyself even to the earth
and wouldst desire rather to be in subjection to all
than to have authority over one
nor wouldst thou long for pleasant days of this life
but wouldst more rejoice to be afflicted for god’s sake
and wouldst esteem it gain to be counted for nought amongst men.
oh, if these things were sweet to thy taste
and moved thee to the bottom of thine heart
how shouldst thou dare even once to complain
are not all laborious things to be endured for the sake of eternal life
it is no small thing, the losing or gaining the kingdom of god.
lift up therefore thy face to heaven.
behold, i and all my saints with me
who in this world had a hard conflict
now rejoice, are now comforted, are now secure, are now at peace
and shall remain with me evermore in the kingdom of my father
chapter xlviii
of the day of eternity and of the straitnesses of this life
oh most blessed mansion of the city which is above
oh most clear day of eternity which the night obscureth not
but the supreme truth ever enlighteneth, day always joyful
always secure and never changing its state into those which are contrary.
oh would that this day might shine forth
and that all these temporal things would come to an end.
it shineth indeed upon the saints
glowing with unending brightness
but only from afar and through a glass
upon those who are pilgrims on the earth.
the citizens of heaven know how glorious that day is
the exiled sons of eve groan
because this is bitter and wearisome.
the days of this life are few and evil
full of sorrows and straits
where man is defiled with many sins
ensnared with many passions
bound fast with many fears
wearied with many cares
distracted with many questionings
entangled with many vanities
compassed about with many errors
worn away with many labours
weighed down with temptations
enervated by pleasures
tormented by poverty.
oh when shall there be an end of these evils
when shall i be delivered from the wretched slavery of my sins
when shall i be mindful
o lord, of thee alone
when shall i rejoice in thee to the full
when shall i be in true liberty without any impediment
without any burden on mind or body
when shall there be solid peace
peace immovable and secure
peace within and without
peace firm on every side
blessed jesus, when shall i stand to behold thee
when shall i gaze upon the glory of thy kingdom
when shalt thou be to me all in all
oh when shall i be with thee in thy kingdom which thou hast prepared from the foundation of the world for them that love thee
i am left destitute, an exile in a hostile land
where are daily wars and grievous misfortunes.
console my exile, mitigate my sorrow
for towards thee all my desire longeth.
for all is to me a burden
whatsoever this world offereth for consolation.
i yearn to enjoy thee intimately
but i cannot attain unto it.
i long to cleave to heavenly things
but temporal things and unmortified passions press me down.
in my mind i would be above all things
but in my flesh i am unwillingly compelled to be beneath them.
so, wretched man that i am
i fight with myself, and am made grievous even unto myself
while the spirit seeketh to be above and the flesh to be beneath.
oh how i suffer inwardly
while with the mind i discourse on heavenly things
and presently a crowd of carnal things rusheth upon me whilst i pray.
my god, be not thou far from me
nor depart in wrath from thy servant.
cast forth thy lightning and scatter them
send out thine arrows, and let all delusions of my enemy be confounded.
recall my senses unto thyself
cause me to forget all worldly things
grant me quickly to cast away and despise the imaginations of sin.
succour me, o eternal truth, that no vanity may move me.
come unto me, o heavenly sweetness
and let all impurity flee from before thy face.
pardon me also, and of thy mercy deal gently with me
whensoever in prayer i think on anything besides thee
for truly i confess that i am wont to be continually distracted.
for often and often, where in the body i stand or sit
there i myself am not, but rather am i there
whither i am borne by my thoughts.
where my thought is, there am i
and there commonly is my thought where that which i love is.
that readily occurreth to me, which naturally delighteth
or pleaseth through custom.
wherefore thou, who art the truth, hast plainly said
where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
if i love heaven, i gladly meditate on heavenly things.
if i love the world, i rejoice in the delights of the world
and am made sorry by its adversities.
if i love the flesh, i am continually imagining the things which belong to the flesh
if i love the spirit, i am delighted by meditating on spiritual things.
for whatsoever things i love, on these i readily converse and listen
and carry home with me the images of them.
but blessed is that man who for thy sake
o lord, is willing to part from all creatures
who doth violence to his fleshly nature and crucifieth the lusts of the flesh by the fervour of his spirit
so that with serene conscience he may offer unto thee a pure prayer
and be made worthy to enter into the angelic choirs
having shut out from himself, both outwardly and inwardly, all worldly things.
chapter xlix
of the desire after eternal life
and how great blessings are promised to those who strive
my son, when thou feelest the desire of eternal happiness to be poured into thee from above
and longest to depart from the tabernacle of this body
that thou mayest contemplate my glory without shadow of turning
enlarge thine heart, and take in this holy inspiration with all thy desire.
give most hearty thanks to the supreme goodness
who dealeth with thee so graciously, visiteth thee so lovingly
stirreth thee up so fervently, raiseth thee so powerfully
lest thou sink down through thine own weight, to earthly things.
for not by thine own meditating or striving dost thou receive this gift
but by the sole gracious condescension of supreme grace and divine regard
to the end that thou mayest make progress in virtue and in more humility
and prepare thyself for future conflicts
and cleave unto me with all the affection of thy heart
and strive to serve me with fervent will.
my son, often the fire burneth, but the flame ascendeth not without smoke.
so also the desires of some men burn towards heavenly things
and yet they are not free from the temptation of carnal affection.
thus therefore they are not acting with an altogether simple desire for god’s glory when they pray to him so earnestly.
such, too, is oftentimes thy desire
when thou hast imagined it to be so earnest.
for that is not pure and perfect which is tainted with thine own self-seeking.
seek thou not what is pleasant and advantageous to thyself
but what is acceptable and honourable unto me
for if thou judgest rightly
thou must choose and follow after my appointment rather than thine own desire
yea, rather than anything that can be desired.
i know thy desire, and i have heard thy many groanings.
already thou longest to be in the glorious liberty of the children of god
already the eternal home delighteth thee
and the heavenly country full of joy
but the hour is not yet come
there remaineth still another season
even a season of warfare
a season of labour and probation.
thou desirest to be filled with the chief good
but thou canst not attain it immediately.
i am that good, wait for me, until the kingdom of god shall come.
thou must still be tried upon earth
and be exercised in many things.
consolation shall from time to time be given thee
but abundant satisfying shall not be granted.
be strong therefore
and be thou brave both in working and in suffering things which are against thy nature.
thou must put on the new man
and be changed into another man.
thou must often do what thou wouldst not
and thou must leave undone what thou wouldst do.
what pleaseth others shall have good success
what pleaseth thee shall have no prosperity.
what others say shall be listened to
what thou sayest shall receive no heed.
others shall ask and receive
thou shalt ask and not obtain.
others shall be great in the report of men
but about thee shall nothing be spoken.
to others this or that shall be entrusted
thou shalt be judged useful for nought.
for this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness
and it is a great thing if thou bear it silently.
in this and many like things the faithful servant of the lord is wont to be tried
how far he is able to deny himself and bring himself into subjection in all things.
scarcely is there anything in which thou hast need to mortify thyself so much as in seeing things which are adverse to thy will
especially when things are commanded thee to be done which seem to thee inexpedient or of little use to thee.
and because thou darest not resist a higher power
being under authority
therefore it seemeth hard for thee to shape thy course according to the nod of another
and to forego thine own opinion.
but consider, my son, the fruit of these labours
the swift end, and the reward exceeding great
and thou shalt find it no pain to bear them then
but rather the strongest solace of thy patience.
for even in exchange for this trifling desire which thou hast readily forsaken
thou shalt always have thy will in heaven.
there verily thou shalt find all that thou wouldst
all that thou canst long for.
there thou shalt have all good within thy power without the fear of losing it.
there thy will, ever at one with mine
shall desire nothing outward
nothing for itself.
there no man shall withstand thee
none shall complain of thee, none shall hinder
nothing shall stand in thy path
but all things desired by thee shall be present together
and shall refresh thy whole affection
and fill it up even to the brim.
there i will glory for the scorn suffered here
the garment of praise for sorrow
and for the lowest place a throne in the kingdom for ever.
there shall appear the fruit of obedience
the labour of repentance shall rejoice
and humble subjection shall be crowned gloriously.
now therefore bow thyself humbly under the hands of all men
nor let it trouble thee who said this or who ordered that
but take special heed that whether thy superior
thy inferior, or thy equal, require anything from thee
or even show a desire for it, take it all in good part
and study with a good will to fulfil the desire.
let one seek this, another that
let this man glory in this, and that man in that
and be praised a thousand thousand times
but rejoice thou only in the contempt of thyself
and in mine own good pleasure and glory.
this is what thou art to long for
even that whether by life or by death god may be ever magnified in thee
chapter l
how a desolate man ought to commit himself into the hands of god
o lord
holy father
be thou blessed now and evermore
because as thou wilt so it is done
and what thou doest is good.
let thy servant rejoice in thee
not in himself, nor in any other
because thou alone art the true joy
thou art my hope and my crown
thou art my joy and my honour, o lord.
what hath thy servant
which he received not from thee
even without merit of his own
thine are all things which thou hast given
and which thou hast made.
i am poor and in misery even from my youth up
and my soul is sorrowful unto tears
sometimes also it is disquieted within itself
because of the sufferings which are coming upon it.
i long after the joy of peace
for the peace of thy children do i beseech
for in the light of thy comfort they are fed by thee.
if thou give peace, if thou pour into me holy joy
the soul of thy servant shall be full of melody
and devout in thy praise.
but if thou withdraw thyself as too often thou art wont
he will not be able to run in the way of thy commandments
but rather he will smite his breast and will bow his knees
because it is not with him as yesterday and the day before
when thy candle shined upon his head
and he walked under the shadow of thy wings
from the temptations which beset him.
o father, righteous and ever to be praised
the hour cometh when thy servant is to be proved.
o beloved father, it is well that in this hour thy servant suffer somewhat for thy sake.
o father, evermore to be adored
as the hour cometh which thou foreknewest from everlasting
when for a little while thy servant should outwardly bow down
but always live inwardly with thee
when for a little while he should be little regarded
humbled, and fail in the eyes of men
should be wasted with sufferings and weaknesses
to rise again with thee in the dawn of the new light
and be glorified in the heavenly places.
o holy father, thou hast ordained it so
and so hast willed it
and that is done which thou thyself hast commanded.
for this is thy favour to thy friend
that he should suffer and be troubled in the world for thy love’s sake
how often soever, and by whomsoever and whosoever thou hast suffered it to be done.
without thy counsel and providence
and without cause, nothing cometh to pass on the earth.
it is good for me, lord, that i had been in trouble
that i may learn thy statutes
and may cast away all pride of heart and presumption.
it is profitable for me that confusion hath covered my face
that i may seek to thee for consolation rather than unto men.
by this also i have learned to dread thine unsearchable judgment
who afflictest the just with the wicked
but not without equity and justice.
thanks be unto thee, because thou hast not spared my sins
but hast beaten me with stripes of love
inflicting pains, and sending troubles upon me without and within.
there is none who can console me
of all things which are under heaven
but thou only, o lord my god
thou heavenly physician of souls
who dost scourge and hast mercy
who leadest down to hell and bringest up again.
thy discipline over me, and thy rod itself shall teach me.
behold, o beloved father, i am in thy hands
i bow myself under the rod of thy correction.
smite my back and my neck that i may bend my crookedness to thy will.
make me a pious and lowly disciple, as thou wert wont to be kind
that i may walk according to every nod of thine.
to thee i commend myself and all that i have for correction
better is it to be punished here than hereafter.
thou knowest all things and each of them
and nothing remaineth hid from thee in man’s conscience.
before they are, thou knowest that they will be
and thou needest not that any man teach thee or admonish thee concerning the things which are done upon the earth.
thou knowest what is expedient for my profit
and how greatly trouble serveth unto the scrubbing off the rust of sin.
do with me according to thy desired good pleasure
and despise not my life which is full of sin
known to none so entirely and fully as to thee alone.
grant me, o lord
to know that which ought to be known
to love that which ought to be loved
to praise that which pleaseth thee most
to esteem that which is precious in thy sight
to blame that which is vile in thine eyes.
suffer me not to judge according to the sight of bodily eyes
nor to give sentence according to the hearing of the ears of ignorant men
but to discern in true judgment between visible and spiritual things
and above all things to be ever seeking after the will of thy good pleasure.
oftentimes the senses of men are deceived in judging
the lovers of the world also are deceived in that they love only visible things.
what is a man better because by man he is reckoned very great
the deceiver deceiveth the deceiver
the vain man the vain, the blind man the blind
the weak man the weak, when they exalt one another
and in truth they rather put to shame, while they foolishly praise.
chapter li
that we must give ourselves to humble works when we are unequal to those that are lofty
my son, thou art not always able to continue in very fervent desire after virtues
nor to stand fast in the loftier region of contemplation
but thou must of necessity sometimes descend to lower things because of thine original corruption
and bear about the burden of corruptible life
though unwillingly and with weariness.
so long as thou wearest a mortal body
thou shalt feel weariness and heaviness of heart.
therefore thou oughtest to groan often in the flesh because of the burden of the flesh
inasmuch as thou canst not give thyself to spiritual studies and divine contemplation unceasingly.
at such a time it is expedient for thee to flee to humble and external works
and to renew thyself with good actions
to wait for my coming and heavenly visitation with sure confidence
to bear thy exile and drought of mind with patience
until thou be visited by me again
and be freed from all anxieties.
for i will cause thee to forget thy labours
and altogether to enjoy eternal peace.
i will spread open before thee the pleasant pastures of the scriptures
that with enlarged heart thou mayest begin to run in the way of my commandments.
and thou shalt say
the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
chapter lii
that a man ought not to reckon himself worthy of consolation
but more worthy of chastisement
o lord, i am not worthy of thy consolation
nor of any spiritual visitation
and therefore thou dealest justly with me
when thou leavest me poor and desolate.
for if i were able to pour forth tears like the sea
still should i not be worthy of thy consolation.
therefore am i nothing worthy save to be scourged and punished
because i have grievously and many a time offended thee
and in many things have greatly sinned.
therefore, true account being taken
i am not worthy even of the least of thy consolations.
but thou, gracious and merciful god
who willest not that thy works should perish
to show forth the riches of thy mercy upon the vessels of mercy
vouchsafest even beyond all his own deserving
to comfort thy servant above the measure of mankind.
for thy consolations are not like unto the discoursings of men.
what have i done, o lord
that thou shouldst bestow any heavenly comfort upon me
i remember not that i have done any good
but have been ever prone to sin and slow to amendment.
it is true and i cannot deny it.
if i should say otherwise
thou wouldst rise up against me
and there would be none to defend me.
what have i deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire
in very truth i confess that i am worthy of all scorn and contempt
nor is it fit that i should be remembered among thy faithful servants.
and although i be unwilling to hear this
nevertheless i will for the truth’s sake
accuse myself of my sins
that the more readily i may prevail to be accounted worthy of thy mercy.
what shall i say, guilty that i am and filled with confusion
i have no mouth to utter, unless it be this word alone
i have sinned, lord, i have sinned
have mercy upon me, forgive me
let me alone, that i may take comfort a little before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death.
what dost thou so much require of a guilty and miserable sinner
as that he be contrite, and humble himself for his sins
in true contrition and humiliation of heart is begotten the hope of pardon
the troubled conscience is reconciled
lost grace is recovered
a man is preserved from the wrath to come
and god and the penitent soul hasten to meet each other with a holy kiss.
the humble contrition of sinners is an acceptable sacrifice unto thee
o lord, sending forth a smell sweeter far in thy sight than the incense.
this also is that pleasant ointment which thou wouldst have poured upon thy sacred feet
for a broken and contrite heart thou hast never despised.
there is the place of refuge from the wrathful countenance of the enemy.
there is amended and washed away whatsoever evil hath elsewhere been contracted.
chapter liii
that the grace of god doth not join itself to those who mind earthly things
my son, precious is my grace
it suffereth not itself to be joined with outward things
nor with earthly consolations.
therefore thou oughtest to cast away all things which hinder grace
if thou longest to receive the inpouring thereof.
seek a secret place for thyself
love to dwell alone with thyself
desire the conversation of no one
but rather pour out thy devout prayer to god
that thou mayest possess a contrite mind and a pure conscience.
count the whole world as nought
seek to be alone with god before all outward things.
for thou canst not be alone with me
and at the same time be delighted with transitory things.
thou oughtest to be separated from thy acquaintances and dear friends
and keep thy mind free from all worldly comfort.
so the blessed apostle peter beseecheth
that christ’s faithful ones bear themselves in this world as strangers and pilgrims.
oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world
but to have a heart so separated from all things
a sickly soul doth not yet comprehend
nor doth the carnal man know the liberty of the spiritual man.
but if indeed he desire to be spiritually minded
he must renounce both those who are far off
and those who are near
and to beware of no man more than himself.
if thou perfectly conquer thyself
very easily shalt thou subdue all things besides.
perfect victory is the triumph over oneself.
for whoso keepeth himself in subjection
in such manner that the sensual affections obey the reason
and the reason in all things obeyeth me
he truly is conqueror of himself
and lord of the world.
if thou desire to climb to this height
thou oughtest to start bravely
and to lay the axe to the root
to the end that thou mayest pull up and destroy the hidden inordinate inclination towards thyself
and towards all selfish and earthly good.
from this sin, that a man loveth himself too inordinately
almost everything hangeth which needeth to be utterly overcome
when that evil is conquered and put under foot
there shall be great peace and tranquillity continually.
but because few strive earnestly to die perfectly to themselves
and do not heartily go forth from themselves
therefore do they remain entangled in themselves
and cannot be raised in spirit above themselves.
but he who desireth to walk at liberty with me
must of necessity mortify all his evil and inordinate affections
and must cling to no creature with selfish love
of the diverse motions of nature and of grace
my son, pay diligent heed to the motions of nature and of grace
because they move in a very contrary and subtle manner
and are hardly distinguished save by a spiritual and inwardly enlightened man.
all men indeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they say or do
and thus under the appearance of good many are deceived.
nature is deceitful and draweth away
ensnareth, and deceiveth many, and always hath self for her end
but grace walketh in simplicity and turneth away from every appearance of evil
maketh no false pretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of god
in whom also she finally resteth.
nature is very unwilling to die
and to be pressed down, and to be overcome
and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily
but grace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality
seeketh to be subdued, longeth to be conquered
and willeth not to use her own liberty.
she loveth to be held by discipline
and not to have authority over any
but always to live, to remain
to have her being under god
and for god’s sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of man.
nature laboureth for her own advantage
and considereth what profit she may gain from another
but grace considereth more
not what may be useful and convenient to self
but what may be profitable to the many.
nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence
but grace faithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to god.
nature feareth confusion and contempt
but grace rejoiceth to suffer shame for the name of jesus.
nature loveth ease and bodily quiet
grace cannot be unemployed, but gladly embraceth labour.
nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive
and abhorreth those which are rough and cheap
grace is delighted with things simple and humble
despiseth not those which are rough
nor refuseth to be clothed with old garments.
nature hath regard to things temporal
rejoiceth in earthly lucre, is made sad by loss
vexed by any little injurious word
but grace reacheth after things eternal
cleaveth not to those which are temporal
is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words
because she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought perisheth.
nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she giveth
loveth things that are personal and private to herself
while grace is kind and generous
avoideth selfishness, is contented with a little
believeth that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
nature inclineth thee to created things
to thine own flesh, to vanities and dissipation
but grace draweth to god and to virtues
renounceth creatures, fleeth from the world
hateth the desires of the flesh
restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public.
nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the senses may have delight
but grace seeketh to be comforted in god alone
and to have delight in the chief good above all visible things.
nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit
can do nothing as a free favour
but hopeth to attain something as good or better
or some praise or favour for her benefits
and she loveth that her own deeds and gifts should be highly valued
but grace seeketh nothing temporal
nor requireth any other gift of reward than god alone
neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such as may suffice for the attaining of eternal life.
nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk
she boasteth of noble place and noble birth
she smileth on the powerful
flattereth the rich, applaudeth those who are like herself
but grace loveth even her enemies
and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends
setteth no store upon high place or high birth
unless there be greater virtue therewith
favoureth the poor man more than the rich
hath more sympathy with the innocent than with the powerful
rejoiceth with the truthful, not with the liar
always exhorteth the good to strive after better gifts of grace
and to become by holiness like unto the son of god.
nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble
grace beareth want with constancy.
nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself
striveth and argueth for self
but grace bringeth back all things to god from whom they came at the beginning
ascribeth no good to herself nor arrogantly presumeth
is not contentious, nor preferreth her own opinion to others
but in every sense and understanding submitteth herself to the eternal wisdom and the divine judgment.
nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things
she loveth to appear abroad
and to make experience of many things through the senses
she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which win praise and admiration
but grace careth not to gather up new or curious things
because all this springeth from the old corruption
whereas there is nothing new or lasting upon earth.
so she teacheth to restrain the senses
to shun vain complacency and ostentation
to hide humbly those things which merit praise and real admiration
and from everything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit
and the praise and honour of god.
she desireth not to receive praise for herself or her own
but longeth that god be blessed in all his gifts
who out of unmingled love bestoweth all things
this grace is a supernatural light
and a certain special gift of god
and the proper mark of the elect
and the pledge of eternal salvation
it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are heavenly
and it maketh the carnal man spiritual.
so far therefore as nature is utterly pressed down and overcome
so far is greater grace bestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations
after the image of god.
chapter lv
of the corruption of nature and the efficacy of divine grace
o lord my god, who hast created me after thine own image and similitude
grant me this grace
which thou hast shown to be so great and so necessary for salvation
that i may conquer my wicked nature
which draweth me to sin and to perdition.
for i feel in my flesh the law of sin
contradicting the law of my mind
and bringing me into captivity to the obedience of sensuality in many things
nor can i resist its passions
unless thy most holy grace assist me
fervently poured into my heart.
there is need of thy grace
yea, and of a great measure thereof
that my nature may be conquered
which hath alway been prone to evil from my youth.
for being fallen through the first man adam
and corrupted through sin
the punishment of this stain descended upon all men
so that nature itself, which was framed good and right by thee
is now used to express the vice and infirmity of corrupted nature
because its motion left unto itself draweth men away to evil and to lower things.
for the little power which remaineth is as it were one spark lying hid in the ashes.
this is natural reason itself, encompassed with thick clouds
having yet a discernment of good and evil
a distinction of the true and the false
though it be powerless to fulfil all that it approveth
and possess not yet the full light of truth
nor healthfulness of its affections.
hence it is, o my god, that i delight in thy law after the inward man
knowing that thy commandment is holy and just and good
reproving also all evil, and the sin that is to be avoided
yet with the flesh i serve the law of sin
whilst i obey sensuality rather than reason.
hence it is that to will to do good is present with me
but how to perform it i find not.
hence i ofttimes purpose many good things
but because grace is lacking to help mine infirmities
i fall back before a little resistance and fail.
hence it cometh to pass that i recognize the way of perfectness
and see very clearly what things i ought to do
but pressed down by the weight of my own corruption
i rise not to the things which are more perfect.
oh how entirely necessary is thy grace to me
o lord, for a good beginning, for progress
and for bringing to perfection.
for without it i can do nothing
but i can do all things through thy grace which strengtheneth me.
o truly heavenly grace, without which our own merits are nought
and no gifts of nature at all are to be esteemed.
arts, riches, beauty, strength, wit, eloquence
they all avail nothing before thee, o lord, without thy grace.
for the gifts of nature belong to good and evil alike
but the proper gift of the elect is grace—that is
love—and they who bear the mark thereof are held worthy of everlasting life.
so mighty is this grace that without it neither the gift of prophecy nor the working of miracles
nor any speculation, howsoever lofty, is of any value at all.
but neither faith, nor hope
nor any other virtue is accepted with thee without love and grace.
o most blessed grace that makest the poor in spirit rich in virtues
and renderest him who is rich in many things humble in spirit
come thou, descend upon me, fill me early with thy consolation
lest my soul fail through weariness and drought of mind.
i beseech thee, o lord, that i may find grace in thy sight
for thy grace is sufficient for me
when i obtain not those things which nature longeth for.
if i be tempted and vexed with many tribulations
i will fear no evil, while thy grace remaineth with me.
this alone is my strength
this bringeth me counsel and help.
it is more powerful than all enemies
and wiser than all the wise men in the world.
it is the mistress of truth
the teacher of discipline
the light of the heart, the solace of anxiety
the banisher of sorrow, the deliverer from fear
the nurse of devotion, the drawer forth of tears.
what am i without it, save a dry tree
a useless branch, worthy to be cast away
let thy grace, therefore, o lord
always prevent and follow me
and make me continually given to all good works through jesus christ
that we ought to deny ourselves
and to imitate christ by means of the cross
my son, so far as thou art able to go out of thyself so far shalt thou be able to enter into me.
as to desire no outward thing worketh internal peace
so the forsaking of self inwardly joineth unto god.
i will that thou learn perfect self-denial
living in my will without contradiction or complaint.
follow me, i am the way, the truth, and the life.
without the way thou canst not go
without the truth thou canst not know
without the life thou canst not live.
i am the way which thou oughtest to follow
the truth which thou oughtest to believe
the life which thou oughtest to hope for.
i am the way unchangeable, the truth infallible, the life everlasting.
i am the way altogether straight, the truth supreme, the true life, the blessed life, the uncreated life.
if thou remain in my way thou shalt know the truth, and the truth shall make thee free
and thou shalt lay hold on eternal life.
if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
if thou wilt know the truth, believe in me.
if thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast.
if thou wilt be my disciple, deny thyself.
if thou wouldst possess the blessed life, despise the life which now is.
if thou wilt be exalted in heaven, humble thyself in the world.
if thou wilt reign with me, bear the cross with me
for only the servants of the cross find the way of blessedness and of true light
o lord jesu, forasmuch as thy life was straitened and despised by the world
grant unto me to imitate thee in despising the world
for the servant is not greater than his lord
nor the disciple above his master.
let thy servant be exercised in thy life
because there is my salvation and true holiness.
whatsoever i read or hear besides it, it refresheth me not
nor giveth me delight.
my son, because thou knowest these things and hast read them all
blessed shalt thou be if thou doest them.
he who hath my commandments and keepeth them
he it is that loveth me, and i will love him
and will manifest myself to him, and i will make him to sit down with me in my father’s kingdom
o lord jesu, as thou hast said and promised
even so let it be unto me, and grant me to prove worthy.
i have received the cross at thy hand, i have carried it
and will carry it even unto death, as thou hast laid it upon me.
truly the life of a truly devoted servant is a cross
but it leadeth to paradise.
i have begun, i may not return back nor leave it.
come, my brothers, let us together go forward.
jesus shall be with us.
for jesus’ sake have we taken up this cross
for jesus’ sake let us persevere in the cross.
he will be our helper, who was our captain and forerunner.
behold our king entereth in before us, and he will fight for us.
let us follow bravely, let no man fear terrors
let us be prepared to die bravely in battle
and let us not so stain our honour, as to fly from the cross.
that a man must not be too much cast down when he falleth into some faults
my son, patience and humility in adversities are more pleasing to me than much comfort and devotion in prosperity.
why doth a little thing spoken against thee make thee sad
if it had been more, thou still oughtest not to be moved.
but now suffer it to go by, it is not the first, it is not new
and it will not be the last, if thou live long.
thou art brave enough, so long as no adversity meeteth thee.
thou givest good counsel also
and knowest how to strengthen others with thy words
but when tribulation suddenly knocketh at thine own door
thy counsel and strength fail.
consider thy great frailty
which thou dost so often experience in trifling matters nevertheless
for thy soul’s health these things are done when they and such like happen unto thee.
put them away from thy heart as well as thou canst
and if tribulation hath touched thee
yet let it not cast thee down nor entangle thee long.
at the least, bear patiently, if thou canst not joyfully.
and although thou be very unwilling to hear it
and feel indignation, yet check thyself
and suffer no unadvised word to come forth from thy lips
whereby the little ones may be offended.
soon the storm which hath been raised shall be stilled
and inward grief shall be sweetened by returning grace.
i yet live, saith the lord, ready to help thee
and to give thee more than wonted consolation if thou put thy trust in me
and call devoutly upon me.
be thou more calm of spirit
and gird thyself for greater endurance.
all is not frustrated
though thou find thyself very often afflicted or grievously tempted.
thou art man, not god, thou art flesh, not an angel.
how shouldst thou be able to remain alway in the same state of virtue
when an angel in heaven fell
and the first man in paradise
i am he who lifteth up the mourners to deliverance
and those who know their own infirmity i raise up to my own nature
o lord, blessed be thy word
sweeter to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb.
what should i do in my so great tribulations and anxieties
unless thou didst comfort me with thy holy words
if only i may attain unto the haven of salvation
what matter is it what things or how many i suffer
give me a good end, give me a happy passage out of this world.
remember me, o my god, and lead me by the right way unto thy kingdom.
chapter lviii
of deeper matters
and god’s hidden judgments which are not to be inquired into
my son, beware thou dispute not of high matters and of the hidden judgments of god
why this man is thus left, and that man is taken into so great favour
why also this man is so greatly afflicted
and that so highly exalted.
these things pass all man’s power of judging
neither may any reasoning or disputation have power to search out the divine judgments.
when therefore the enemy suggesteth these things to thee
or when any curious people ask such questions
answer with that word of the prophet
just art thou, o lord, and true is thy judgment
and with this, the judgments of the lord are true
and righteous altogether.
my judgments are to be feared, not to be disputed on
because they are incomprehensible to human understanding.
and be not given to inquire or dispute about the merits of the saints
which is holier than another
or which is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.
such questions often beget useless strifes and contentions
they also nourish pride and vain glory
whence envyings and dissensions arise
while one man arrogantly endeavoureth to exalt one saint and another another.
but to wish to know and search out such things bringeth no fruit
but it rather displeaseth the saints
for i am not the god of confusion but of peace
which peace consisteth more in true humility than in self-exaltation.
some are drawn by zeal of love to greater affection to these saints or those
but this is human affection rather than divine.
i am he who made all the saints
i gave them grace, i brought them glory
i know the merits of every one
i prevented them with the blessings of my goodness.
i foreknew my beloved ones from everlasting
i chose them out of the world
they did not choose me.
i called them by my grace, drew them by my mercy
led them on through sundry temptations.
i poured mighty consolations upon them
i gave them perseverance, i crowned their patience.
i acknowledge the first and the last
i embrace all with inestimable love.
i am to be praised in all my saints
i am to be blessed above all things
and to be honoured in every one whom i have so gloriously exalted and predestined
without any preceding merits of their own.
he therefore that shall despise one of the least of these my people
honoureth not the great, because i made both small and great.
and he who speaketh against any of my saints speaketh against me
and against all others in the kingdom of heaven
they are all one through the bond of charity
they think the same thing, will the same thing
and all are united in love one to another.
but yet which is far better they love me above themselves and their own merits.
for being caught up above themselves
and drawn beyond self-love, they go all straightforward to the love of me
and they rest in me in perfect enjoyment.
there is nothing which can turn them away or press them down
for being full of eternal truth, they burn with the fire of inextinguishable charity.
therefore let all carnal and natural men hold their peace concerning the state of the saints
for they know nothing save to love their own personal enjoyment.
they take away and add according to their own inclination
not as it pleaseth the eternal truth.
in many men this is ignorance, chiefly is it so in those who
being little enlightened
rarely learn to love any one with perfect spiritual love.
they are still much drawn by natural affection and human friendship to these or to those
and as they reckon of themselves in lower matters
so also do they frame imaginations of things heavenly.
but there is an immeasurable difference between those things which they imperfectly imagine
and these things which enlightened men behold through supernatural revelation.
take heed, therefore, my son
that thou treat not curiously those things which surpass thy knowledge
but rather make this thy business and give attention to it
namely, that thou seek to be found, even though it be the least, in the kingdom of god.
and even if any one should know who were holier than others
or who were held greatest in the kingdom of heaven
what should that knowledge profit him
unless through this knowledge he should humble himself before me
and should rise up to give greater praise unto my name
he who considereth how great are his own sins
how small his virtues
and how far he is removed from the perfection of the saints
doeth far more acceptably in the sight of god
than he who disputeth about their greatness or littleness.
they are altogether well content
if men would learn to be content
and to refrain from vain babbling.
they glory not of their own merits
seeing they ascribe no good unto themselves, but all unto me
seeing that i of my infinite charity have given them all things.
they are filled with so great love of the divinity
and with such overflowing joy
that no glory is lacking to them
neither can any felicity be lacking.
all the saints, the higher they are exalted in glory
the humbler are they in themselves
and the nearer and dearer are they unto me.
and so thou hast it written that they cast their crowns before god and fell on their faces before the lamb
and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
many ask who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
who know not whether they shall be worthy to be counted among the least.
it is a great thing to be even the least in heaven
where all are great, because all shall be called, and shall be, the sons of god.
a little one shall become a thousand
but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
for when the disciples asked who should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
they received no other answer than this
except ye be converted and become as little children
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
but whosoever shall humble himself as this little child
the same shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven
woe unto them who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the little children
for the low gate of the kingdom of heaven will not suffer them to enter in.
woe also to them who are rich, who have their consolation here
because whilst the poor enter into the kingdom of god
they shall stand lamenting without.
rejoice ye humble, and exult ye poor
for yours is the kingdom of god if only ye walk in the truth.
chapter lix
that all hope and trust is to be fixed in god alone
o lord, what is my trust which i have in this life
or what is my greatest comfort of all the things which are seen under heaven
is it not thou, o lord my god
whose mercies are without number
where hath it been well with me without thee
or when could it be evil whilst thou wert near
i had rather be poor for thy sake
than rich without thee.
i choose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with thee than without thee to possess heaven.
where thou art, there is heaven.
and where thou are not, behold there death and hell.
thou art all my desire
and therefore must i groan and cry and earnestly pray after thee.
in short i can confide fully in none to give me ready help in necessities
save in thee alone, o my god.
thou art my hope, thou art my trust
thou art my comforter
and most faithful in all things.
all men seek their own
thou settest forward only my salvation and my profit
and turnest all things unto my good.
even though thou dost expose me to divers temptations and adversities
thou ordainest all this unto my advantage
for thou are wont to prove thy beloved ones in a thousand ways.
in which proving thou oughtest no less to be loved and praised
than if thou wert filling me full of heavenly consolations.
in thee, therefore, o lord god
i put all my hope and my refuge
on thee i lay all my tribulation and anguish
because i find all to be weak and unstable whatsoever i behold out of thee.
for many friends shall not profit
nor strong helpers be able to succour
nor prudent counsellors to give a useful answer
nor the books of the learned to console
nor any precious substance to deliver
nor any secret and beautiful place to give shelter
if thou thyself do not assist, help, strengthen, comfort, instruct, keep in safety.
for all things which seem to belong to the attainment of peace and felicity are nothing when thou art absent
and bring no felicity at all in reality.
therefore art thou the end of all good
and the fulness of life
and the soul of eloquence
and to hope in thee above all things is the strongest solace of thy servants.
mine eyes look unto thee
in thee is my trust
o my god, father of mercies.
bless and sanctify my soul with heavenly blessing that it may become thy holy habitation
and the seat of thy eternal glory
and let nothing be found in the temple of thy divinity which may offend the eyes of thy majesty.
according to the greatness of thy goodness and the multitude of thy mercies look upon me
and hear the prayer of thy poor servant
far exiled from thee in the land of the shadow of death.
protect and preserve the soul of thy least servant amid so many dangers of corruptible life
and by thy grace accompanying me
direct it by the way of peace unto its home of perpetual light.
the fourth book
of the sacrament of the altar
a devout exhortation to the holy communion
the voice of christ
come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden
and i will refresh you, saith the lord.
the bread that i will give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world.
take, eat, this is my body, which is given for you
this do in remembrance of me.
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him.
the words that i speak unto you
they are spirit, and they are life.
chapter i
with how great reverence christ must be received
the voice of the disciple
these are thy words, o christ, eternal truth
though not uttered at one time nor written together in one place of scripture.
because therefore they are thy words and true
i must gratefully and faithfully receive them all.
they are thine, and thou hast uttered them
and they are mine also
because thou didst speak them for my salvation.
gladly i receive them from thy mouth
that they may be more deeply implanted in my heart.
words of such great grace arouse me
for they are full of sweetness and love
but my own sins terrify me
and my impure conscience driveth me away from receiving so great mysteries.
the sweetness of thy words encourageth me
but the multitude of my faults presseth me down.
thou commandest that i draw near to thee with firm confidence
if i would have part with thee
and that i receive the food of immortality
if i desire to obtain eternal life and glory.
come unto me, sayest thou, all that labour and are heavy laden
and i will refresh you.
oh, sweet and lovely word in the ear of the sinner
that thou, o lord my god, dost invite the poor and needy to the communion of thy most holy body and blood.
but who am i, o lord
that i should presume to approach unto thee
behold the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee
and yet thou sayest, come ye all unto me.
what meaneth this most gracious condescension
this most lovely invitation, how shall i dare to come
who know no good thing of myself, whence i might be able to presume
how shall i bring thee within my house
seeing that i so often have sinned in thy most loving sight
angels and archangels stand in awe of thee
the saints and just men fear thee, and thou sayest
come unto me, except thou, lord, hadst said it
who should believe it true, and except thou hadst commanded
who should attempt to draw near ?
behold, noah, that just man, laboured for a hundred years in building the ark
that he might be saved with the few
and i, how shall i be able in one hour to prepare myself to receive the builder of the world with reverence
moses, thy servant, thy great and especial friend
made an ark of incorruptible wood
which also he covered with purest gold
that he might lay up in it the tables of the law
and i, a corruptible creature
shall i dare thus easily to receive thee
the maker of the law and the giver of life
solomon, the wisest of the kings of israel
was seven years building his magnificent temple to the praise of thy name
and for eight days celebrated the feast of its dedication
offered a thousand peace offerings
and solemnly brought up the ark of the covenant to the place prepared for it
with the sound of trumpets and great joy
and i, unhappy and poorest of mankind
how shall i bring thee into my house
who scarce know how to spend half an hour in devotion
and oh that it were even one half hour worthily spent
o my god, how earnestly these holy men strove to please thee
and alas, how little and trifling is that which i do
how short a time do i spend, when i am disposing myself to communion.
rarely altogether collected
most rarely cleansed from all distraction.
and surely in the saving presence of thy godhead no unmeet thought ought to intrude
nor should any creature take possession of me
because it is not an angel but the lord of the angels
that i am about to receive as my guest.
yet there is a vast difference between the ark of the covenant with its relics
and thy most pure body with its ineffable virtues
between those sacrifices of the law
which were figures of things to come
and the true sacrifice of thy body
the completion of all the ancient sacrifices.
wherefore then do i not yearn more ardently after thy adorable presence
why do i not prepare myself with greater solicitude to receive thy holy things
when those holy patriarchs and prophets of old
kings also and princes, with the whole people
manifested so great affection of devotion towards thy divine service ?
the most devout king david danced with all his might before the ark of god
calling to mind the benefits granted to his forefathers in days past
he fashioned musical instruments of various sorts
put forth psalms, and appointed them to be sung with joy
played also himself ofttimes on the harp
being inspired with the grace of the holy ghost
he taught the people of israel to praise god with the whole heart
and with unity of voice to bless and praise him every day.
if so great devotion was then exercised
and celebration of divine praise was carried on before the ark of the testimony
how great reverence and devotion ought now to be shown by me and all christian people at the ministering of the sacrament
at receiving the most precious body and blood of christ.
many run to diverse places to visit the memorials of departed saints
and rejoice to hear of their deeds and to look upon the beautiful buildings of their shrines.
and behold, thou art present here with me
o my god, saint of saints
creator of men and lord of the angels.
often in looking at those memorials men are moved by curiosity and novelty
and very little fruit of amendment is borne away
especially when there is so much careless trifling and so little true contrition.
but here in the sacrament of the altar
thou art present altogether, my god, the man christ jesus
where also abundant fruit of eternal life is given to every one soever that receiveth thee worthily and devoutly.
but to this no levity draweth, no curiosity, nor sensuality
only steadfast faith, devout hope, and sincere charity.
o god, invisible creator of the world, how wondrously dost thou work with us
how sweetly and graciously thou dealest with thine elect
to whom thou offerest thyself to be received in this sacrament
for this surpasseth all understanding
this specially draweth the hearts of the devout and enkindleth their affections.
for even thy true faithful ones themselves
who order their whole life to amendment
oftentimes gain from this most excellent sacrament great grace of devotion and love of virtue.
oh admirable and hidden grace of the sacrament
which only christ’s faithful ones know
but the faithless and those who serve sin cannot experience
in this sacrament is conferred spiritual grace
and lost virtue is regained in the soul
and the beauty which was disfigured by sin returneth again.
so great sometimes is this grace that out of the fulness of devotion given
not only the mind but also the weak body feeleth that more strength is supplied unto it.
but greatly must we mourn and lament over our lukewarmness and negligence
that we are not drawn by greater affection to become partakers of christ
in whom all the hope and the merit of those that are to be saved consist.
for he himself is our sanctification and redemption.
he is the consolation of pilgrims and the eternal fruition of the saints.
therefore it is grievously to be lamented that many so little consider this health-giving mystery
which maketh heaven glad and preserveth the whole world.
alas for the blindness and hardness of man’s heart
that he considereth not more this unspeakable gift
and even slippeth down through the daily use into carelessness.
for if this most holy sacrament were celebrated in one place only
and were consecrated only by one priest in the whole world
with what great desire thinkest thou
would men be affected towards that place and towards such a priest of god
that they might behold the divine mysteries celebrated
but now are many men made priests and in many places the sacrament is celebrated
that the grace and love of god towards men might the more appear
the more widely the holy communion is spread abroad over all the world.
thanks be unto thee, o good jesus, eternal shepherd
who hast vouchsafed to refresh us, poor and exiled ones
with thy precious body and blood.
and to invite us to partake these holy mysteries by the invitation from thine own mouth
saying, come unto me, ye who labour and are heavy laden
and i will refresh you.
chapter ii
that the greatness and charity of god is shown to men in the sacrament
the voice of the disciple
trusting in thy goodness and great mercy
o lord, i draw near, the sick to the healer
the hungering and thirsting to the fountain of life
the poverty-stricken to the king of heaven
the servant to the lord, the creature to the creator
the desolate to my own gentle comforter.
but whence is this unto me, that thou comest unto me
who am i that thou shouldest offer me thyself
how doth a sinner dare to appear before thee
and how dost thou vouchsafe to come to the sinner
thou knowest thy servant
and thou knowest that he hath in him no good thing for which thou shouldest grant him this grace.
i confess therefore mine own vileness
i acknowledge thy goodness
i praise thy tenderness
and i give thee thanks for thine exceeding great love.
for thou doest this for thine own sake
not for my merits
that thy goodness may be more manifest unto me
thy charity more abundantly poured out upon me
and thy humility more perfectly commended unto me.
therefore because this pleaseth thee and thou hast commanded that thus it shall be
thy condescension pleaseth me also
and oh that mine iniquity hinder it not.
o most sweet and tender jesus, what reverence
what giving of thanks is due to thee with perpetual praise for the receiving of thy sacred body and blood
the dignity whereof no man is found able to express.
but what shall i think upon in this communion in approaching my lord
whom i am not able worthily to honour
and nevertheless whom i long devoutly to receive
what shall be better and more healthful meditation for me
than utter humiliation of myself before thee
and exaltation of thine infinite goodness towards me
i praise thee, o my god, and exalt thee for evermore.
i despise myself, and cast myself down before thee into the deep of my vileness.
behold, thou art the saint of saints and i the refuse of sinners
behold, thou stoopest unto me who am not worthy to look upon thee
behold, thou comest unto me
thou willest to be with me
thou invitest me to thy feast.
thou willest to give me the heavenly food and bread of angels to eat
none other, in truth, than thyself
the living bread, which didst descend from heaven
and givest life to the world.
behold, whence this love proceedeth
what manner of condescension shineth forth herein.
what great giving of thanks and praise is due unto thee for these benefits
oh how salutary and profitable thy purpose when thou didst ordain this
how sweet and pleasant the feast when thou didst give thyself for food
oh how admirable is thy working
o lord, how mighty thy power
how unspeakable thy truth, for thou didst speak the word
and all things were made
and this is done which thou hast commanded.
a thing wonderful, and worthy of faith
and surpassing all the understanding of man
that thou, o lord my god, very god and very man
givest thyself altogether to us in a little bread and wine
and art so our inexhaustible food.
thou, o lord of all, who hast need of nothing
hast willed to dwell in us through thy sacrament.
preserve my heart and my body undefiled
that with a joyful and pure conscience i may be able very often to celebrate
and receive to my perpetual health.
thy mysteries
which thou hast consecrated and instituted both for thine own honour
and for a perpetual memorial.
rejoice, o my soul, and give thanks unto god for so great a gift and precious consolation
left unto thee in this vale of tears.
for so oft as thou callest this mystery to mind and receivest the body of christ
so often dost thou celebrate the work of thy redemption
and art made partaker of all the merits of christ.
for the charity of christ never groweth less
and the greatness of his propitiation is never exhausted.
therefore, by continual renewal of thy spirit
thou oughtest to dispose thyself hereunto and to weigh the great mystery of salvation with attentive consideration.
so great, new, and joyful ought it to appear to thee when thou comest to communion
as if on this self-same day christ for the first time were descending into the virgin’s womb and becoming man
or hanging on the cross, suffering and dying for the salvation of mankind.
the words in brackets are only suitable for a priest.
chapter iii
that it is profitable to communicate often
the voice of the disciple
behold i come unto thee, o lord, that i may be blessed through thy gift
and be made joyful in thy holy feast which thou
o god, of thy goodness hast prepared for the poor.
behold in thee is all that i can and ought to desire
thou art my salvation and redemption
my hope and strength, my honour and glory.
therefore rejoice the soul of thy servant this day
for unto thee, o lord jesus, do i lift up my soul.
i long now to receive thee devoutly and reverently
i desire to bring thee into my house
so that with zacchaeus i may be counted worthy to be blessed by thee and numbered among the children of abraham.
my soul hath an earnest desire for thy body
my heart longeth to be united with thee.
give me thyself and it sufficeth
for besides thee no consolation availeth.
without thee i cannot be
and without thy visitation i have no power to live.
and therefore i must needs draw nigh unto thee often
and receive thee for the healing of my soul
lest haply i faint by the way if i be deprived of heavenly food.
for so thou, most merciful jesus
preaching to the people and healing many sick
didst once say, i will not send them away fasting to their own homes
lest they faint by the way.
deal therefore now to me in like manner
for thou left thyself for the consolation of the faithful in the sacrament.
for thou art the sweet refreshment of the soul
and he who shall eat thee worthily shall be partaker and inheritor of the eternal glory.
necessary indeed it is for me
who so often slide backwards and sin
so quickly wax cold and faint, to renew, cleanse
enkindle myself by frequent prayers and penitences and receiving of thy sacred body and blood lest haply by too long abstinence
i fall short of my holy resolutions.
for the imaginations of man’s heart are evil from his youth
and except divine medicine succour him
man slideth away continually unto the worse.
the holy communion therefore draweth us back from evil
and strengtheneth us for good.
for if i now be so negligent and lukewarm when i communicate or celebrate
how should it be with me, if i receive not this medicine
and sought not so great a help
and though i am not every day fit nor well prepared to celebrate
i will nevertheless give diligent heed at due season
to receive the divine mysteries
and to become partaker of so great grace.
for this is the one principal consolation of a faithful soul
so long as it is absent from thee in mortal body
that being continually mindful of its god
it receiveth its beloved with devout spirit.
oh wonderful condescension of thy pity surrounding us
that thou, o lord god
creator and quickener of all spirits
deignest to come unto a soul so poor and weak
and to appease its hunger with thy whole deity and humanity.
oh happy mind and blessed soul
to which is granted devoutly to receive thee its lord god
and in so receiving thee to be filled with all spiritual joy
oh how great a lord doth it entertain
how beloved a guest doth it bring in
how delightful a companion doth it receive
how faithful a friend doth it welcome
how beautiful and exalted a spouse
above every other beloved, doth it embrace
one to be loved above all things that can be desired
oh my most sweet beloved
let heaven and earth and all the glory of them
be silent in thy presence
seeing whatsoever praise and beauty they have it is of thy gracious bounty
and they shall never reach unto the loveliness of thy name
whose wisdom is infinite.
chapter iv
that many good gifts are bestowed upon those who communicate devoutly
the voice of the disciple, o lord my god
prevent thou thy servant with the blessings of thy sweetness
that i may be enabled to draw near worthily and devoutly to thy glorious sacrament.
awaken my heart towards thee
and deliver me from heavy slumber.
visit me with thy salvation that i may in spirit taste thy sweetness
which plentifully lieth hid in this sacrament as in a fountain.
lighten also mine eyes to behold this so great mystery
and strengthen me that i may believe it with undoubting faith.
for it is thy word, not human power
it is thy holy institution, not the invention of man.
for no man is found fit in himself to receive and to understand these things
which transcend even the wisdom of the angels.
what portion then shall i, unworthy sinner
who am but dust and ashes
be able to search into and comprehend of so deep a sacrament ?
o lord, in the simplicity of my heart
in good and firm faith, and according to thy will
i draw nigh unto thee with hope and reverence
and truly believe that thou art here present in the sacrament, god and man.
thou willest therefore that i receive thee and unite myself to thee in charity.
wherefore i beseech thy mercy
and implore thee to give me thy special grace
to this end, that i may be wholly dissolved and overflow with love towards thee
and no more suffer any other consolation to enter into me.
for this most high and most glorious sacrament is the health of the soul and the body
the medicine of all spiritual sickness
whereby i am healed of my sins
my passions are bridled, temptations are conquered or weakened
more grace is poured into me, virtue begun is increased
faith is made firm, hope is strengthened
and charity is enkindled and enlarged.
for in this sacrament thou hast bestowed many good things and still bestowest them continually on thine elect who communicate devoutly
o my god, lifter up of my soul
repairer of human infirmity, and giver of all inward consolation.
for thou pourest into them much consolation against all sorts of tribulation
and out of the deep of their own misery thou liftest them up to the hope of thy protection
and with ever new grace, dost inwardly refresh and enlighten them
so that they who felt themselves to be anxious and without affection before communion
afterwards being refreshed with heavenly food and drink
find themselves changed for the better.
and even in such wise thou dealest severally with thine elect
that they may truly acknowledge and clearly make proof that they have nothing whatsoever of their own
and what goodness and grace come to them from thee
because being in themselves cold
hard of heart, indevout, through thee they become fervent, zealous, and devout.
for who is there coming humbly to the fountain of sweetness
carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that sweetness
or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat
and thou art ever a full and overflowing fountain
a fire continually burning, and never going out.
wherefore if it is not suffered to me to draw from the fulness of the fountain
nor to drink unto satisfying
yet will i set my lips to the mouth of the heavenly conduit
that at least i may receive a small drop to quench my thirst
that i dry not up within my heart.
and if i am not yet able to be altogether heavenly and so enkindled as the cherubim and seraphim
yet will i endeavour to give myself unto devotion
and to prepare my heart, that i may gain if it be but a little flame of the divine fire
through the humble receiving of the life-giving sacrament.
but whatsoever is wanting unto me, o merciful jesus
most holy saviour, do thou of thy kindness and grace supply
who hast vouchsafed to call all unto thee
saying, come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden
and i will refresh you.
i indeed labour in the sweat of my face, i am tormented with sorrow of heart
i am burdened with sins, i am disquieted with temptations
i am entangled and oppressed with many passions, and there is none to help me
there is none to deliver and ease me
but thou, o lord god, my saviour
to whom i commit myself and all things that are mine
that thou mayest preserve me and lead me unto life eternal.
receive me unto the praise and glory of thy name
who hast prepared thy body and blood to be my meat and drink.
grant, o lord god my saviour
that with coming often to thy mysteries the zeal of my devotion may increase.
chapter v
of the dignity of this sacrament, and of the office of the priest
the voice of the beloved
if thou hadst angelic purity and the holiness of holy john the baptist
thou wouldest not be worthy to receive or to minister this sacrament.
for this is not deserved by merit of man that a man should consecrate and minister the sacrament of christ
and take for food the bread of angels.
vast is the mystery, and great is the dignity of the priests
to whom is given what is not granted to angels.
for priests only, rightly ordained in the church
have the power of consecrating and celebrating the body of christ.
the priest indeed is the minister of god
using the word of god by god’s command and institution
nevertheless god is there the principal author and invisible worker
that to whom all that he willeth is subject
and all he commandeth is obedient.
therefore thou must believe god almighty in this most excellent sacrament
more than thine own sense or any visible sign at all.
and therefore with fear and reverence is this work to be approached.
take heed therefore and see what it is of which the ministry is committed to thee by the laying on of the bishop’s hand.
behold thou art made a priest and art consecrated to celebrate.
see now that thou do it before god faithfully and devoutly at due time
and shew thyself without blame.
thou hast not lightened thy burden
but art now bound with a straiter bond of discipline
and art pledged to a higher degree of holiness.
a priest ought to be adorned with all virtues and to afford to others an example of good life.
his conversation must not be with the popular and common ways of men
but with angels in heaven or with perfect men on earth.
a priest clad in holy garments taketh christ’s place that he may pray unto god with all supplication and humility for himself and for the whole people.
he must always remember the passion of christ.
he must diligently look upon christ’s footsteps and fervently endeavour himself to follow them.
he must bear meekly for god whatsoever ills are brought upon him by others.
he must mourn for his own sins, and for the sins committed by others
and may not grow careless of prayer and holy oblation
until he prevail to obtain grace and mercy.
when the priest celebrateth, he honoureth god
giveth joy to the angels, buildeth up the church
helpeth the living, hath communion with the departed
and maketh himself a partaker of all good things.
chapter vi
an inquiry concerning preparation for communion
the voice of the disciple, when i consider thy dignity
o lord, and mine own vileness, i tremble very exceedingly
and am confounded within myself.
for if i approach not, i fly from life
and if i intrude myself unworthily, i run into thy displeasure.
what then shall i do, o my god
thou helper and counsellor in necessities.
teach thou me the right way
propound unto me some short exercise befitting holy communion.
for it is profitable to know how i ought to prepare my heart devoutly and reverently for thee
to the intent that i may receive thy sacrament to my soul’s health [or it may be also for the celebrating this so great and divine mystery].
chapter vii
of the examination of conscience, and purpose of amendment
the voice of the beloved, above all things the priest of god must draw nigh
with all humility of heart and supplicating reverence
with full faith and pious desire for the honour of god
to celebrate, minister, and receive this sacrament.
diligently examine thy conscience and with all thy might with true contrition and humble confession cleanse and purify it
so that thou mayest feel no burden
nor know anything which bringeth thee remorse and impedeth thy free approach.
have displeasure against all thy sins in general
and specially sorrow and mourn because of thy daily transgressions.
and if thou have time
confess unto god in the secret of thine heart
all miseries of thine own passion.
lament grievously and be sorry
because thou art still so carnal and worldly
so unmortified from thy passions
so full of the motion of concupiscence
so unguarded in thine outward senses
so often entangled in many vain fancies
so much inclined to outward things
so negligent of internal
so ready to laughter and dissoluteness
so unready to weeping and contrition
so prone to ease and indulgence of the flesh
so dull to zeal and fervour
so curious to hear novelties and behold beauties
so loth to embrace things humble and despised
so desirous to have many things
so grudging in giving
so close in keeping
so inconsiderate in speaking
so reluctant to keep silence
so disorderly in manners
so inconsiderate in actions
so eager after food
so deaf towards the word of god
so eager after rest
so slow to labour
so watchful after tales
so sleepy towards holy watchings
so eager for the end of them
so wandering in attention to them
so negligent in observing the hours of prayer
so lukewarm in celebrating
so unfruitful in communicating
so quickly distracted
so seldom quite collected with thyself
so quickly moved to anger
so ready for displeasure at others
so prone to judging
so severe at reproving
so joyful in prosperity
so weak in adversity
so often making many good resolutions and bringing them to so little effect.
when thou hast confessed and bewailed these and thy other shortcomings
with sorrow and sore displeasure at thine own infirmity
make then a firm resolution of continual amendment of life and of progress in all that is good.
then moreover with full resignation and entire will offer thyself to the honour of my name on the altar of thine heart as a perpetual whole burnt-offering
even by faithfully presenting thy body and soul unto me
to the end that thou mayest so be accounted worthy to draw near to offer this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to god
and to receive the sacrament of my body and blood to thy soul’s health.
for there is no oblation worthier
no satisfaction greater for the destroying of sin
than that a man offer himself to god purely and entirely with the oblation of the body and blood of christ in the holy communion.
if a man shall have done what in him lieth
and shall repent him truly
then how often soever he shall draw nigh unto me for pardon and grace
as i live, saith the lord
i have no pleasure in the death of a sinner
but rather that he should be converted and live.
all his transgressions that he hath committed
they shall not be mentioned unto him.
chapter viii
of the oblation of christ upon the cross
and of resignation of self
the voice of the beloved
as i of my own will offered myself unto god the father on the cross for thy sins with outstretched hands and naked body
so that nothing remained in me that did not become altogether a sacrifice for the divine propitiation
so also oughtest thou every day to offer thyself willingly unto me for a pure and holy oblation with all thy strength and affections
even to the utmost powers of thine heart.
what more do i require of thee than thou study to resign thyself altogether unto me
whatsoever thou givest besides thyself
i nothing care for, for i ask not thy gift, but thee.
as it would not be sufficient for thee if thou hadst all things except me
even so whatsoever thou shalt give me, if thou give me not thyself
it cannot please me.
offer thyself to me, and give thyself altogether for god
so shall thy offering be accepted.
behold i offered myself altogether to the father for thee
i give also my whole body and blood for food
that thou mightest remain altogether mine and i thine.
but if thou stand in thyself, and offer not thyself freely to my will
thy offering is not perfect, neither shall the union betwixt us be complete.
therefore ought the freewill offering of thyself into the hands of god to go before all thy works
if thou wilt attain liberty and grace.
for this is the cause that so few are inwardly enlightened and made free
that they know not how to deny themselves entirely.
my word standeth sure, except a man forsake all, he cannot be my disciple.
thou therefore, if thou wilt be my disciple, offer thyself to me with all thy affections.
chapter ix
that we ought to offer ourselves and all that is ours to god
and to pray for all, the voice of the disciple, lord
all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine.
i desire to offer myself up unto thee as a freewill offering
and to continue thine for ever.
lord, in the uprightness of mine heart i willingly offer myself to thee to-day to be thy servant for ever
in humble submission and for a sacrifice of perpetual praise.
receive me with this holy communion of thy precious body
which i celebrate before thee this day in the presence of the angels invisibly surrounding
that it may be for the salvation of me and of all thy people.
lord, i lay before thee at this celebration all my sins and offences which i have committed before thee and thy holy angels
from the day whereon i was first able to sin even unto this hour
that thou mayest consume and burn them every one with the fire of thy charity
and mayest do away all the stains of my sins
and cleanse my conscience from all offence
and restore me to thy favour which by sinning i have lost
fully forgiving me all, and mercifully admitting me to the kiss of peace.
what can i do concerning my sins
save humbly to confess and lament them and unceasingly to beseech thy propitiation
i beseech thee, be propitious unto me and hear me
when i stand before thee, o my god.
all my sins displease me grievously
i will never more commit them, but i grieve for them and will grieve so long as i live
steadfastly purposing to repent me truly
and to make restitution as far as i can.
forgive, o god, forgive me my sins for thy holy name’s sake
save my soul, which thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.
behold i commit myself to thy mercy
i resign myself to thy hands.
deal with me according to thy loving-kindness
not according to my wickedness and iniquity.
i offer also unto thee all my goodness
though it is exceedingly little and imperfect
that thou mayest mend and sanctify it
that thou mayest make it well pleasing and acceptable in thy sight
and ever draw it on towards perfection
and furthermore bring me safely
slothful and useless poor creature that i am
to a happy and blessed end.
moreover i offer unto thee all pious desires of the devout
necessities of parents, friends, brothers, sisters
and all who are dear to me, and of those who have done good to me
or to others for thy love
and those who have desired and besought my prayers for themselves and all belonging to them
that all may feel themselves assisted by thy grace
enriched by consolation, protected from dangers, freed from pains
and that being delivered from all evils they may joyfully give thee exceeding thanks.
i offer also to thee prayers and sacramental intercessions for those specially who have injured me in aught
made me sad, or spoken evil concerning me
or have caused me any loss or displeasure
for all those also whom i have at any time made sad, disturbed, burdened, and scandalized by words or deeds
knowingly or ignorantly, that to all of us alike
thou mayest equally pardon our sins and mutual offences.
take away, o lord, from our hearts all suspicion, indignation, anger, and contention
and whatsoever is able to injure charity and diminish brotherly love.
have mercy, have mercy, lord
on those who entreat thy mercy, give grace to the needy
and make us such that we may be worthy to enjoy thy grace
and go forward to the life eternal.
chapter x
that holy communion is not lightly to be omitted
the voice of the beloved
thou must frequently betake thee to the fountain of grace and divine mercy
to the fountain of goodness and all purity
to the end that thou mayest obtain the healing of thy passions and vices
and mayest be made stronger and more watchful against all temptations and wiles of the devil.
the enemy, knowing what profit and exceeding strong remedy lieth in the holy communion
striveth by all means and occasions to draw back and hinder the faithful and devout
so far as he can.
for when some set about to prepare themselves for holy communion
they suffer from the more evil suggestions of satan.
the very evil spirit himself as is written in job
cometh among the sons of god that he may trouble them by his accustomed evil dealing
or make them over timid and perplexed
to the intent that he may diminish their affections
or take away their faith by his attacks
if haply he may prevail upon them to give up holy communion altogether
or to come thereto with lukewarm hearts.
but his wiles and delusions must not be heeded
howsoever wicked and terrible they be
but all his delusion must be cast back upon his own head.
the wretch must be despised and laughed to scorn
neither must holy communion be omitted because of his insults and the inward troubles which he stirreth up.
often also too much carefulness or some anxiety or other touching confession hindereth from obtaining devotion.
do thou according to the counsel of wise men
and lay aside anxiety and scruple
because it hindereth the grace of god and destroyeth devotion of mind.
because of some little vexation or trouble do not thou neglect holy communion
but rather hasten to confess it
and forgive freely all offences committed against thee.
and if thou hast offended any man
humbly beg for pardon, and god shall freely forgive thee.
what profiteth it to put off for long time the confession of thy sins
or to defer holy communion
cleanse thyself forthwith
spit out the poison with all speed
hasten to take the remedy
and thou shalt feel thyself better than if thou didst long defer it.
if to-day thou defer it on one account
to-morrow perchance some greater obstacle will come
and so thou mayest be long time hindered from communion and become more unfit.
as soon as thou canst
shake thyself from thy present heaviness and sloth
for it profiteth nothing to be long anxious
to go long on thy way with heaviness of heart
and because of daily little obstacles to sever thyself from divine things
nay it is exceeding hurtful to defer thy communion long
for this commonly bringeth on great torpor.
alas, there are some, lukewarm and undisciplined
who willingly find excuses for delaying repentance
and desire to defer holy communion
lest they should be bound to keep stricter watch upon themselves.
alas, how little charity
what flagging devotion
have they who so lightly put off holy communion.
how happy is he, how acceptable to god
who so liveth, and in such purity of conscience keepeth himself
that any day he could be ready and well inclined to communicate
if it were in his power, and might be done without the notice of others.
if a man sometimes abstaineth for the sake of humility or some sound cause
he is to be commended for his reverence.
but if drowsiness have taken hold of him
he ought to rouse himself and to do what in him lieth
and the lord will help his desire for the good will which he hath
which god specially approveth.
but when he is hindered by sufficient cause
yet will he ever have a good will and pious intention to communicate
and so he shall not be lacking in the fruit of the sacrament.
for any devout man is able every day and every hour to draw near to spiritual communion with christ to his soul’s health and without hindrance.
nevertheless on certain days and at the appointed time he ought to receive the body and blood of his redeemer with affectionate reverence
and rather to seek after the praise and honour of god
than his own comfort.
for so often doth he communicate mystically, and is invisibly refreshed
as he devoutly calleth to mind the mystery of christ’s incarnation and his passion
and is inflamed with the love of him.
he who only prepareth himself when a festival is at hand or custom compelleth
will too often be unprepared.
blessed is he who offereth himself to god for a whole burnt-offering
so often as he celebrateth or communicateth
be not too slow nor too hurried in thy celebrating
but preserve the good received custom of those with whom thou livest.
thou oughtest not to produce weariness and annoyance in others
but to observe the received custom
according to the institution of the elders
and to minister to the profit of others rather than to thine own devotion or feeling.
chapter xi
that the body and blood of christ and the holy scriptures are most necessary to a faithful soul
the voice of the disciple
o most sweet lord jesus
how great is the blessedness of the devout soul that feedeth with thee in thy banquet
where there is set before it no other food than thyself its only beloved
more to be desired than all the desires of the heart
and to me it would verily be sweet to pour forth my tears in thy presence from the very bottom of my heart
and with the pious magdalene to water thy feet with my tears.
but where is this devotion
where the abundant flowing of holy tears
surely in thy presence and in the presence of the holy angels my whole heart ought to burn and to weep for joy
for i have thee in the sacrament verily present
although hidden under other form.
for in thine own divine brightness
mine eyes could not endure to behold thee
neither could the whole world stand before the splendour of the glory of thy majesty.
in this therefore thou hast consideration unto my weakness
that thou hidest thyself under the sacrament.
i verily possess and adore him whom the angels adore in heaven
i yet for a while by faith
but they by sight and without a veil.
it is good for me to be content with the light of true faith
and to walk therein until the day of eternal brightness dawn
and the shadows of figures flee away.
but when that which is perfect is come
the using of sacraments shall cease
because the blessed in heavenly glory have no need of sacramental remedy.
for they rejoice unceasingly in the presence of god
beholding his glory face to face
and being changed from glory to glory of the infinite god
they taste the word of god made flesh
as he was in the beginning and remaineth for everlasting.
when i think on these wondrous things
even spiritual comfort whatsoever it be becometh sore weariness to me
for so long as i see not openly my lord in his own glory
i count for nothing all which i behold and hear in the world.
thou, o god, art my witness that nothing is able to comfort me
no creature is able to give me rest, save thou, o my god
whom i desire to contemplate everlastingly.
but this is not possible
so long as i remain in this mortal state.
therefore ought i to set myself unto great patience
and submit myself unto thee in every desire.
for even thy saints
o lord, who now rejoice with thee in the kingdom of heaven
waited for the coming of thy glory whilst they lived here
in faith and great glory.
what they believed, that believe i, what they hoped
i hope, whither they have attained to, thither through thy grace hope i to come.
i will walk meanwhile in faith
strengthened by the examples of the saints.
i will have also holy books for comfort and for a mirror of life
and above them all thy most holy body and blood shall be for me a special remedy and refuge.
for two things do i feel to be exceedingly necessary to me in this life
without which this miserable life would be intolerable to me
being detained in the prison of this body
i confess that i need two things
even food and light.
thou hast therefore given to me who am so weak
thy sacred body and blood
for the refreshing of my soul and body
and hast set thy word for a lantern to my feet.
without these two i could not properly live
for the word of god is the light of my soul
and thy sacrament the bread of life.
these may also be called the two tables
placed on this side and on that
in the treasury of thy holy church.
one table is that of the sacred altar
bearing the holy bread
that is the precious body and blood of christ
the other is the table of the divine law
containing holy doctrine
teaching the true faith
and leading steadfastly onwards even to that which is within the veil
where the holy of holies is.
thanks be unto thee
o lord jesus, light of light everlasting
for that table of holy doctrine which thou has furnished unto us by thy servants the prophets and apostles and other teachers.
thanks be to thee, o creator and redeemer of men
who to make known thy love to the whole world has prepared a great supper
in which thou hast set forth for good not the typical lamb
but thine own most holy body and blood
making all thy faithful ones joyful with this holy banquet and giving them to drink the cup of salvation
wherein are all the delights of paradise
and the holy angels do feed with us
and with yet happier sweetness.
oh how great and honourable is the office of the priests
to whom it is given to consecrate the sacrament of the lord of majesty with holy words
to bless it with the lips
to hold it in their hands
to receive it with their own mouth
and to administer it to others
oh how clean ought those hands to be
how pure the mouth, how holy the body
how unspotted the heart of the priest
to whom so often the author of purity entereth in
from the mouth of the priest ought naught to proceed but what is holy
what is honest and profitable
because he so often receiveth the sacrament of christ.
his eyes ought to be single and pure
seeing they are wont to look upon the body of christ
the hands should be pure and lifted towards heaven
which are wont to hold within them the creator of heaven and earth.
to priests is it specially said in the law
be ye holy, for i the lord your god am holy.
assist us with thy grace
o almighty god, that we who have taken upon us the priestly office
may be able to converse worthily and devoutly with thee in all purity and good conscience.
and if we are not able to have our conversation in such innocency of life as we ought
yet grant unto us worthily to lament the sins which we have committed
and in the spirit of humility and full purpose of a good will
to serve thee more earnestly for the future.
chapter xii
that he who is about to communicate with christ ought to prepare himself with great diligence
the voice of the beloved, i am the lover of purity
and giver of sanctity.
i seek a pure heart, and there is the place of my rest.
prepare for me the larger upper room furnished
and i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
if thou wilt that i come unto thee and abide with thee
purge out the old leaven, and cleanse the habitation of thy heart.
shut out the whole world, and all the throng of sins
sit as a sparrow alone upon the house-top
and think upon thy transgressions with bitterness of thy soul.
for everyone that loveth prepareth the best and fairest place for his beloved
because hereby the affection of him that entertaineth his beloved is known.
yet know thou that thou canst not make sufficient preparation out of the merit of any action of thine
even though thou shouldest prepare thyself for a whole year
and hadst nothing else in thy mind.
but out of my tenderness and grace alone art thou permitted to draw nigh unto my table
as though a beggar were called to a rich man’s dinner
and had no other recompense to offer him for the benefits done unto him
but to humble himself and to give him thanks.
do therefore as much as lieth in thee
and do it diligently, not of custom, nor of necessity, but with fear, reverence, and affection
receive the body of thy beloved lord god, who vouchsafeth to come unto thee.
i am he who hath called thee, i commanded it to be done
i will supply what is lacking to thee
come and receive me.
when i give the grace of devotion, give thanks unto thy god
it is not because thou art worthy, but because i had mercy on thee.
if thou hast not devotion, but rather feelest thyself dry
be instant in prayer, cease not to groan and knock
cease not until thou prevail to obtain some crumb or drop of saving grace.
thou hast need of me, i have no need of thee.
nor dost thou come to sanctify me
but i come to sanctify thee and make thee better.
thou comest that thou mayest be sanctified by me
and be united to me, that thou mayest receive fresh grace
and be kindled anew to amendment of life.
see that thou neglect not this grace
but prepare thy heart with all diligence
and receive thy beloved unto thee.
but thou oughtest not only to prepare thyself for devotion before communion
thou must also keep thyself with all diligence therein after receiving the sacrament
nor is less watchfulness needed afterwards
than devout preparation beforehand
for good watchfulness afterwards becometh in turn the best preparation for the gaining more grace.
for hereby is a man made entirely indisposed to good
if he immediately return from communion to give himself up to outward consolations.
beware of much speaking, remain in a secret place
and hold communion with thy god
for thou hast him whom the whole world cannot take away from thee.
i am he to whom thou oughtest wholly to give thyself
so that now thou mayest live not wholly in thyself
but in me, free from all anxiety.
chapter xiii
that the devout soul ought with the whole heart to yearn after union with christ in the sacrament
the voice of the disciple, who shall grant unto me
o lord, that i may find thee alone, and open all my heart unto thee
and enjoy thee as much as my soul desireth
and that no man may henceforth look upon me
nor any creature move me or have respect unto me
but thou alone speak unto me and i unto thee
even as beloved is wont to speak unto beloved
and friend to feast with friend, for this do i pray
this do i long for, that i may be wholly united unto thee
and may withdraw my heart from all created things
and by means of holy communion and frequent celebration may learn more and more to relish heavenly and eternal things.
ah, lord god, when shall i be entirely united and lost in thee
and altogether forgetful of myself, thou in me
and i in thee, even so grant that we may in like manner continue together in one.
verily thou art my beloved, the choicest among ten thousand
in whom my soul delighteth to dwell all the days of her life.
verily thou art my peacemaker, in whom is perfect peace and true rest
apart from whom is labour and sorrow and infinite misery.
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself
and thy counsel is not with the wicked
but thy word is with the humble and the simple.
o how sweet, o lord, is thy spirit
who that thou mightest manifest thy sweetness towards thy children
dost vouchsafe to refresh them with the bread which is full of sweetness
which cometh down from heaven.
verily there is no other nation so great
which hath its gods drawing nigh to them
as thou, our god, art present unto all thy faithful ones
unto whom for their daily solace
and for lifting up their heart unto heaven
thou givest thyself for their food and delight.
for what other nation is there so renowned as the christian people
or what creature is so beloved under heaven as the devout soul to which god entereth in
that he may feed it with his glorious flesh
o unspeakable grace, o wonderful condescension
o immeasurable love specially bestowed upon men
but what reward shall i give unto the lord for this grace
for charity so mighty.
there is nothing which i am able to present more acceptable than to give my heart altogether unto god
and to join it inwardly to him.
then all my inward parts shall rejoice
when my soul shall be perfectly united unto god.
then shall he say unto me, if thou wilt be with me
i will be with thee, and i will answer him
vouchsafe, o lord, to abide with me
i will gladly be with thee, this is my whole desire
even that my heart be united unto thee
chapter xiv
of the fervent desire of certain devout persons to receive the body and blood of christ
the voice of the disciple, o how great is the abundance of thy sweetness
o lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee.
when i call to mind some devout persons who draw nigh to thy sacrament
o lord, with the deepest devotion and affection
then very often i am confounded in myself and blush for shame
that i approach thine altar and table of holy communion so carelessly and coldly
that i remain so dry and without affection
that i am not wholly kindled with love before thee
my god, nor so vehemently drawn and affected as many devout persons have been
who out of the very earnest desire of the communion
and tender affection of heart, could not refrain from weeping
but as it were with mouth of heart and body alike panted inwardly after thee
o god, o fountain of life
having no power to appease or satiate their hunger
save by receiving thy body with all joyfulness and spiritual eagerness.
o truly ardent faith of those, becoming a very proof of thy sacred presence
for they verily know their lord in the breaking of bread
whose heart so ardently burneth within them when jesus walketh with them by the way.
ah me, far from me for the most part is such love and devotion as this
such vehement love and ardour.
be merciful unto me, o jesus, good, sweet, and kind
and grant unto thy poor suppliant to feel sometimes
in holy communion, though it be but a little
the cordial affection of thy love, that my faith may grow stronger
my hope in thy goodness increase, and my charity
once kindled within me by the tasting of the heavenly manna, may never fail.
but thy mercy is able even to grant me the grace which i long for
and to visit me most tenderly with the spirit of fervour when the day of thy good pleasure shall come.
for, although i burn not with desire so vehement as theirs who are specially devout towards thee
yet, through thy grace, i have a desire after that greatly inflamed desire
praying and desiring to be made partaker with all those who so fervently love thee
and to be numbered among their holy company.
chapter xv
that the grace of devotion is acquired by humility and self-denial
the voice of the beloved, thou oughtest to seek earnestly the grace of devotion
to ask it fervently, to wait for it patiently and faithfully
to receive it gratefully, to preserve it humbly
to work with it diligently, and to leave to god the time and manner of heavenly visitation until it come.
chiefly oughtest thou to humble thyself when thou feelest inwardly little or no devotion
yet not to be too much cast down, nor to grieve out of measure.
god ofttimes giveth in one short moment what he hath long time denied
he sometimes giveth at the end what at the beginning of prayer he hath deferred to give.
if grace were always given immediately, and were at hand at the wish
it would be hardly bearable to weak man.
wherefore the grace of devotion is to be waited for with a good hope and with humble patience.
yet impute it to thyself and to thy sins when it is not given
or when it is mysteriously taken away.
it is sometimes a small thing which hindereth and hideth grace
if indeed that ought to be called small and not rather great
which hindereth so great a good
but if thou remove this, be it small or great
and perfectly overcome it, thou wilt have what thou hast asked.
for immediately that thou hast given thyself unto god with all thine heart
and hast sought neither this nor that according to thine own will and pleasure
but hast altogether settled thyself in him
thou shalt find thyself united and at peace
because nothing shall give thee so sweet relish and delight
as the good pleasure of the divine will.
whosoever therefore shall have lifted up his will unto god with singleness of heart
and shall have delivered himself from every inordinate love or dislike of any created thing
he will be the most fit for receiving grace
and worthy of the gift of devotion.
for where the lord findeth empty vessels
there giveth he his blessing.
and the more perfectly a man forsaketh things which cannot profit
and the more he dieth to himself, the more quickly doth grace come
the more plentifully doth it enter in
and the higher doth it lift up the free heart.
then shall he see, and flow together
and wonder, and his heart shall be enlarged within him
because the hand of the lord is with him
and he hath put himself wholly in his hand, even for ever.
lo, thus shall the man be blessed
that seeketh god with all his heart
and receiveth not his soul in vain.
this man in receiving the holy eucharist obtaineth the great grace of divine union
because he hath not regard to his own devotion and comfort
but above all devotion and comfort to the glory and honour of god.
chapter xvi
that we ought to lay open our necessities to christ and to require his grace
the voice of the disciple, o most sweet and loving lord
whom now i devoutly desire to receive
thou knowest my infirmity and the necessity which i suffer
in what evils and vices i lie
how often i am weighed down, tempted, disturbed, and defiled.
i come unto thee for remedy, i beseech of thee consolation and support.
i speak unto thee who knowest all things, to whom all my secrets are open
and who alone art able perfectly to comfort and help me.
thou knowest what good thing i most stand in need of
and how poor i am in virtues.
behold, i stand poor and naked before thee
requiring grace, and imploring mercy.
refresh the hungry suppliant, kindle my coldness with the fire of thy love
illuminate my blindness with the brightness of thy presence.
turn thou all earthly things into bitterness for me
all grievous and contrary things into patience
all things worthless and created into contempt and oblivion.
lift up my heart unto thee in heaven
and suffer me not to wander over the earth.
be thou alone sweet unto me from this day forward for ever
because thou alone art my meat and drink
my love and joy, my sweetness and my whole good.
oh that thou wouldest altogether by thy presence
kindle, consume, and transform me into thyself
that i may be made one spirit with thee
by the grace of inward union, and the melting of earnest love
suffer me not to go away from thee hungry and dry
but deal mercifully with me
as oftentimes thou hast dealt wondrously with thy saints.
what marvel if i should be wholly kindled from thee
and in myself should utterly fail
since thou art fire always burning and never failing
love purifying the heart and enlightening the understanding.
chapter xvii
of fervent love and vehement desire of receiving christ
the voice of the disciple, with the deepest devotion and fervent love
with all affection and fervour of heart
i long to receive thee, o lord
even as many saints and devout persons have desired thee in communicating
who were altogether well pleasing to thee by their sanctity of life
and dwelt in all ardent devotion.
o my god, eternal love, my whole good
happiness without measure
i long to receive thee with the most vehement desire and becoming reverence which any saint ever had or could have.
and although i be unworthy to have all those feelings of devotion
yet do i offer thee the whole affection of my heart
even as though i alone had all those most grateful inflamed desires.
yea, also, whatsoever things a pious mind is able to conceive and long for
all these with the deepest veneration and inward fervour do i offer and present unto thee.
i desire to reserve nothing unto myself
but freely and entirely to offer myself and all that i have unto thee for a sacrifice.
o lord my god, my creator and redeemer
with such affection, reverence, praise, and honour
with such gratitude, worthiness, and love
with such faith, hope, and purity do i desire to receive thee this day
as thy most blessed mother, the glorious virgin mary
received and desired thee, when she humbly and devoutly answered the angel
who brought unto her the glad tidings of the mystery of the incarnation.
behold the handmaid of the lord
be it unto me according to thy word.
and as thy blessed forerunner
the most excellent of saints
john baptist, being full of joy in thy presence
leapt while yet in the womb of his mother
for joy in the holy ghost, and afterwards discerning jesus walking amongst men
humbled himself exceedingly, and said, with devout affection
the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him
rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice
even so i wish to be inflamed with great and holy desires
and to present myself unto thee with my whole heart.
whence also, on behalf of myself and of all commended to me in prayer
i offer and present unto thee the jubilation of all devout hearts
their ardent affections, their mental ecstasies
and supernatural illuminations and heavenly visions
with all the virtues and praises celebrated and to be celebrated by every creature in heaven and earth
to the end that by all thou mayest worthily be praised and glorified for ever.
receive my prayers, o lord my god, and my desires of giving thee infinite praise and unbounded benediction
which, according to the multitude of thine unspeakable greatness, are most justly due unto thee.
these do i give thee, and desire to give every day and every moment
and with beseechings and affectionate desires i call upon all celestial spirits and all thy faithful people to join with me in rendering thee thanks and praises.
let all peoples, nations, and tongues praise thee
and magnify thy holy and sweet-sounding name
with highest jubilations and ardent devotion.
and let all who reverently and devoutly celebrate thy most high sacrament
and receive it with full assurance of faith
be accounted worthy to find grace and mercy with thee
and intercede with all supplication for me a sinner
and when they shall have attained unto their wished-for devotion and joyous union with thee
and shall depart full of comfort and wondrously refreshed from thy holy
heavenly table, let them vouchsafe to be mindful of me, for i am poor and needy.
chapter xviii
that a man should not be a curious searcher of the sacrament
but a humble imitator of christ, submitting his sense to holy faith
the voice of the beloved
thou must take heed of curious and useless searching into this most profound sacrament
if thou wilt not be plunged into the abyss of doubt.
he that is a searcher of majesty shall be oppressed by the glory thereof.
god is able to do more than man can understand.
a pious and humble search after truth is to be allowed
when it is always ready to be taught
and striving to walk after the wholesome opinions of the fathers.
blessed is the simplicity which leaveth alone the difficult paths of questionings
and followeth the plain and firm steps of god’s commandments.
many have lost devotion whilst they sought to search into deeper things.
faith is required of thee
and a sincere life, not loftiness of intellect
nor deepness in the mysteries of god.
if thou understandest not nor comprehendest the things which are beneath thee
how shalt thou comprehend those which are above thee
submit thyself unto god, and humble thy sense to faith
and the light of knowledge shall be given thee
as shall be profitable and necessary unto thee.
there are some who are grievously tempted concerning faith and the sacrament
but this is not to be imputed to themselves but rather to the enemy.
care not then for this, dispute not with thine own thoughts
nor make answer to the doubts which are cast into thee by the devil
but believe the words of god, believe his saints and prophets
and the wicked enemy shall flee from thee.
often it profiteth much, that the servant of god endureth such things.
for the enemy tempteth not unbelievers and sinners
because he already hath secure possession of them
but he tempteth and harasseth the faithful and devout by various means.
go forward therefore with simple and undoubting faith
and draw nigh unto the sacrament with supplicating reverence.
and whatsoever thou art not enabled to understand
that commit without anxiety to almighty god.
god deceiveth thee not, he is deceived who believeth too much in himself.
god walketh with the simple, revealeth himself to the humble
giveth understanding to babes, openeth the sense to pure minds
and hideth grace from the curious and proud.
human reason is weak and may be deceived
but true faith cannot be deceived.
all reason and natural investigation ought to follow faith
not to precede, nor to break it.
for faith and love do here especially take the highest place
and work in hidden ways in this most holy and exceeding excellent sacrament.
god who is eternal and incomprehensible
and of infinite power, doth great and inscrutable things in heaven and in earth
and his wonderful works are past finding out.
if the works of god were of such sort that they might easily be comprehended by human reason
they should no longer be called wonderful or unspeakable.
