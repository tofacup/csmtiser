whereas our bishops

arch-deacons
chapters and colleges
and the other clergy of every diocese within the several provinces of canterbury and york
being respectively summoned and called by virtue of our several writs to the most reverend father in god
our right trusty
and right well-beloved counsellor
william
by divine providence
lord archbishop of canterbury
primate of all england
and metropolitan
and to the most reverend father in god
our right trusty and well-beloved counsellor
richard
by divine providence
lord archbishop of york
primate and metropolitan of england respectively directed
bearing date the twentieth day of february
in the fifteenth year of our reign
to appear before the said lord archbishop of canterbury in our cathedral church of s
paul in london
and before the said lord archbishop of york
in the metropolitan church of s
peter in york the fourteenth day of april than next ensuing
or elsewhere
as they respectively should think it most convenient to treat
consent and conclude
upon certain difficult and urgent affairs contained in the said writs
did thereupon at the time appointed
and within the cathedral church of st paul
and the metropolitan church of s peter aforesaid
assemble themselves respectively together
and appear in several convocations for that purpose
according to the said several writs
before the said lord archbishop of canterbury
and the said lord archbishop of york respectively
and forasmuch as we are given to understand
that many of our subjects being misled against the rites and ceremonies now used in the church of england
have lately taken offence at the same
upon an unjust supposal
that they are not only contrary to our laws
but also introductive unto popish superstitions
whereas it well appeareth unto us upon mature consideration
that the said rites and ceremonies which are now so much quarrelled at
were not only approved of
and used by those learned and godly divines
to whom at the time of reformation under king edward the sixth
the compiling of the book of common prayer was committed divers of which suffered martyrdom in queen mary &apos;s days
but also again taken up by this whole church under queen elizabeth
and so duly and ordinarily practised for a great part of her reign within the memory of divers yet living as that it could not then be imagined
that there would need any rule or law for the observation of the same
or that they could be thought to savour of popery
and albeit since those times
for want of an express rule therein
and by subtle practices
the said rites and ceremonies began to fall into disuse
and in place thereof
other foreign and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in
yet forasmuch as in our own royal chapels
and in many other churches
most of them have been ever constantly used and observed
we cannot now but be very sensible of this matter
and have cause to conceive that the authors and fomentors of these jealousies
though they colour the same with a pretence of zeal
and would seem to strike only at some supposed iniquity in the said ceremonies
yet as we have cause to fear
aim at our own royal person
and would fain have our good subjects imagine that we our self are perverted
and do worship god in a superstitious way
and that we intend to bring in some alteration of the religion here established
now how far we are from that
and how utterly we detest every thought therefore
we have by many public declarations
and otherwise upon sundry occasions
given such assurance to the world
as that from thence we also assure our self
that no man of wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious entertainment to such brainsick jealousies
and for the weaker sort
who are prone to be misled by crafty seducers
we rest no less confident
that even of them
as many as are of loyal
or indeed but of charitable hearts
will from henceforth utterly banish all such causeless fears and surmises
upon these our sacred professions
so often made by us
a christian defender of the faith
their king
and sovereign
and therefore if yet any person
under whatsoever mask of zeal or counterfeit holiness
shall henceforth by speech or writing
or any other way notwithstanding these our right
hearty
faithful
and solemn protestations made before him
whose deputy we are against all and every intention of any popish innovation be so ungracious and presumptuous as to vent any poisoned conceits
tending to such a purpose
and to cast these devilish aspersions and jealousies upon our royal and godly proceedings
we require all our loyal subjects
that they forthwith make the same known to some magistrate
ecclesiastical or civil
and we straightly charge all ordinaries
and every other person in any authority under us
as they will answer the contrary at their utmost peril
that they use no palliation
connivance
or delay therein
but that taking particular information of all the passages
they do forthwith certify the same unto our court of commission for causes ecclesiastical
to be there examined
and proceeded in with all fidelity and tenderness of our royal majesty
as is due to us their sovereign lord and governor
but forasmuch as we well perceive that the misleaders of our well minded people
do make the more advantage for the nourishing of this distemper among them from hence
that the foresaid rites and ceremonies
or some of them
are now insisted upon but only in some dioceses
and are not generally revived in all places
nor constantly and uniformly practised throughout all the churches of our realm
and thereupon have been liable to be quarrelled and opposed by them who use them not
we therefore out of our princely inclination to uniformity and peace
in matters especially that concern the holy worship of god
proposing to our self herein the pious examples of king edward the sixth
and of queen elizabeth
who sent forth injunctions
and orders about the divine service
and other ecclesiastical matters
and of our dear father of blessed memory
king james
who published a book of constitutions and canons ecclesiastical
and according to the act of parliament in this behalf having fully advised herein with our metropolitan
and with our commissioners authorised under our great seal for causes ecclesiastical
have thought good to give them free leave to treat in convocation
and agree upon certain other canons necessary for the advancement of god &apos;s glory
the edifying of his holy church
and the due reverence of his blessed mysteries and sacraments
that as we ever have been
and by god &apos;s assistance by whom alone we reign shall ever so continue careful and ready to cut off superstition with one hand
so we may no less expel irreverence and profaneness with the other
whereby it may please almighty god
so to bless us
and this church committed to our government
that it may at once return unto the true former splendour of uniformity
devotion
and holy order
the luster whereof for some years by past hath been overmuch obscured
through the devices of some ill affected to that sacred order
wherein it had long stood from the very beginning of the reformation
and through inadvertency of some in authority in the church under us
we therefore by virtue of our prerogative royal
and supreme authority in causes ecclesiastical
by our several and respective letters patents under our great seal of england
dated the fifteenth day of april now last past
and the twelfth day of may then next following
for the province of canterbury
and by our like letters patents dated the seven and twentieth day of the same month of april
and the twentieth day of the month of may aforesaid
for the province of york
did give and grant
full
free
and lawful liberty
licence
power and authority unto the said lord archbishop of canterbury
president of the said convocation
for the province of canterbury
and unto the said lord archbishop of york
president of the said convocation for the province of york
and to the rest of the bishops of the said provinces
and unto all deans of cathedral churches
arch-deacons
chapters and colleges
and the whole clergy of every several diocese
within the said several provinces

that they should and might from time to time
during the present parliament
and further during our will and pleasure
confer
treat
debate
consider
consult
and agree of and upon canons
orders
ordinances
and constitutions
as they should think necessary
fit
and convenient for the honour and service of almighty god
the good and quiet of the church
and the better government thereof
to be from time to time observed
performed
fulfilled
and kept
as well by the said arch bishop of canterbury
and the said archbishop of york
the bishops
and their successors
and the rest of the whole clergy of the said several provinces of canterbury and york
in their several callings
offices

and administrations

and every of their distinct courts
and in the order and manner of their
and every of their proceedings
and by all other persons within this realm
as far as lawfully being members of the church it may concern them
as in our said letters patents amongst other clauses more at large doth appear
now forasmuch as the said lord archbishop of canterbury
president of the said convocation for the province of canterbury
and the said archbishop of york
president of said convocation for the province of york
and others the said bishops
deans
arch-deacons
chapters and colleges
with the rest of the clergy
having met together respectively
at the time and places before mentioned respectively
and then and there
by virtue of our said authority granted unto them
treated of
concluded
and agreed upon certain canons
orders
ordinances
and constitutions
to the end and purpose of us limited and prescribed unto them
and have thereupon offered and presented the same unto us
most humbly desiring us to give our royal assent unto the same
according to the form of a certain statute or act of parliament made in that behalf in the 25th
year of the reign of king henry the eighth
and by our said prerogative royal and supreme authority in causes ecclesiastical
to ratify by our letters patents under our great seal of england
and to confirm the same
the title and tenor of them being word for word as ensueth
constitutions and canons ecclesiastical
treated upon by the archbishops of canterbury and york
precedents of the convocations for the respective provinces of canterbury and york
and the rest of the bishops and clergy of those provinces
and agreed upon with the king &apos;s majesty &apos;s licence in their several synods begun at london and york 1640
in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord

i
concerning the regal power
whereas sundry laws
ordinances
and constitutions have been formerly made for the acknowledgement and profession of the most lawful and independent authority of our dread sovereign lord
the kings most excellent majesty
over the state ecclesiastical and civil
we as our duty in the first place binds us
and so far as to us appertaineth enjoin them all to be carefully observed by all persons whom they concern
upon the penalties in the said laws and constitutions expressed
and for the fuller and clearer instruction and information of all christian people within this realm in their duties in this particular
we do further ordain and decree
that every parson
vicar
curate
or preacher upon some one sunday in every quarter of the year at morning prayer
shall in the place where he serves
treatably
and audibly read these explanations of the regal power here inserted
the most high and sacred order of kings is of divine right
being the ordinance of god himself
founded in the prime laws of nature
and clearly established by express texts both of the old and new testaments
a supreme power is given to this most excellent order by god himself in the scriptures
which is
that kings should rule and command in their several dominions all persons of what rank or estate soever
whether ecclesiastical or civil
and that they should restrain and punish with the temporal sword all stubborn and wicked doers
the care of god &apos;s church is so committed to kings in the scripture that they are commended when the church keeps the right way
and taxed when it runs amiss
and therefore her government belongs in chief unto kings
for otherwise one man would be commended for another &apos;s care
and taxed but for another &apos;s negligence
which is not god &apos;s way
the power to call and dissolve counsels both national and provincial is the true right of all christian kings within their own realms or territories
and when in the first times of christ &apos;s church
prelates used this power
it was therefore only because in those days they had no christian kings
and it was then so only used as in times of persecution
that is
with supposition in case it were required of submitting their very lives unto the very laws and commands even of those pagan princes
that they might not so much as seem to disturb their civil government
which christ came to confirm
but by no means to undermine
for any person or persons to set up
maintain
or avow in any their said realms or territories respectively
under any pretence whatsoever
any independent coactive power
either papal or popular whether directly or indirectly is to undermine their great royal office
and cunningly to overthrow that most sacred ordinance
which god himself hath established
and so is treasonable against god
as well as against the king
for subjects to bear arms against their kings
offensive or defensive
upon any pretence whatsoever
is the least to resist the powers
which are ordained of god
and though they do not invade
but only resist
st
paul tells them plainly
they shall receive to themselves damnation
and although tribute
and custom
and aid
and subsidy
and all manner of necessary support and supply
be respectively due to kings from their subjects by the law of god
nature
and nations
for the public defence
care and protection of them
yet nevertheless
subjects have not only possession of
but a true and just right
title and property
to
and in all their goods and estates
and ought so to have
and these two are so far from crossing one another
that they mutually go together
for the honourable and comfortable support of both
for as it is the duty of the subjects to supply their king
so is it part of the kingly office to support his subjects in the property and freedom of their estates
and if any parson
vicar
curate
or preacher shall voluntarily or carelessly neglect his duty in publishing the said explications and conclusions
according to the order above prescribed
he shall be suspended by his ordinary
till such time as upon his penitence he shall give sufficient assurance
or evidence of his amendment
and in case he be of any exempt jurisdiction
he shall be censurable by his majesty &apos;s commissioners for causes ecclesiastical
and we do also hereby require all archbishops
bishops
and all other inferior priests and ministers
that they preach
teach
and exhort their people to obey
honour
and serve their king
and that they presume not to speak of his majesty &apos;s power in any other way then in this canon is expressed
and if any parson
vicar
curate
preacher
or any other ecclesiastical person whatsoever
any dean
canon
or prebendary of any collegiate or cathedral church
any member or student of college or hall
or any reader of divinity
or humanity in either of the universities
or elsewhere
shall in any sermon
lecture
common place
determination
or disputation either by word or writing
publicly maintain or abet any position or conclusion
in opposition or impeachment of the aforesaid explications
or any part or article of them
he shall forthwith by the power of his majesty &apos;s commissioners for causes ecclesiastical
be excommunicated till he repent
and suspended two years from all the profits of his benefice
or other ecclesiastical
academical
or scholastical preferments
and if he so offend a second time
he shall be deprived from all his spiritual promotions
of what nature or degree soever they be
provided always
that if the offence aforesaid be given in either of the universities
by men not having any benefice or ecclesiastical preferment
that then the delinquent shall be censured by the ordinary authority in such cases of that university respectively
where the said fault shall be committed
ii
for the better keeping of the day of his majesty &apos;s most happy inauguration
the synod taking into consideration the most inestimable benefits which this church enjoyeth
under the peaceable and blessed government of our dread sovereign lord
king charles
and finding that aswell the godly christian emperors in the former times
as our own most religious princes since the reformation
have caused the days of their inaugurations to be publicly celebrated by all their subjects
with prayers and thanksgiving to almighty god
and that there is a particular form of prayer appointed by authority for that day and purpose
and yet with all considering how negligent some people are in the observance of this day
in many places of this kingdom doth therefore decree and ordain
that all manner of persons within the church of england
shall from henceforth celebrate
and keep the morning of the said day
in coming diligently and reverently unto their parish church or chapel at the time of prayer
and there continuing all the while
that the prayers
preaching
or other service of the day endureth
in testimony of their humble gratitude to god for so great a blessing
and dutiful affections to so benign and merciful a sovereign
and for the better execution of this our ordinance
the holy synod doth straightly require and charge
and by authority hereof enableth all archbishops
bishops
deans
deans and chapters
arch-deacons
and other ecclesiastical persons
having exempt or peculiar jurisdiction
as also all
chancellors
commissaries
and officials in the church of england
that they inquire into the keeping of the same in their visitations
and punish such as they shall find to be delinquent
according as by law they are to censure
and punish those who wilfully absent themselves from church on holidays
and that the said day may be the better observed
we do enjoin
that all churchwardens shall provide at the parish charge
two of those books at least
appointed for that day
and if there be any want of the said book in any parish
they shall present the same at all visitations respectively
iii
for suppressing of the growth of popery
all and every ecclesiastical persons
of what rank or condition soever
archbishops
and bishops
deans
arch deacons
all having exempt or peculiar jurisdiction
with their several chancellors
commissaries
and officials
all persons entrusted with cure of souls
shall use respectively all possible care and diligence by conferring privately with the parties
and by censures of the church in inferior and higher courts
as also by complaints unto the secular power
to reduce all such to the church of england
who are misled into popish superstition
and first these private conferences shall be performed in each several diocese
either by the bishop in person
if his occasion will permit it
or by some one or more learned ministers at his special appointment
and the said bishop shall also design the time and place of the said several conferences
and all such persons as shall be present which if recusants refuse to observe
they shall be taken for obstinate
and so certified to the bishop
and if the said time and place be not observed by the minister or ministers so appointed
they shall be suspended by their ordinary for the space of six months
without a very reasonable cause alleged to the contrary
provided that they be not sent above ten miles from their dwelling
if the said conferences prevail not
the church must and shall come to her censures
and to make way for them
the said ecclesiastical persons shall carefully inform themselves in the places belonging to their several charges
of all recusants above the age of twelve years
both of such as come not at all to church
as also of those who coming sometimes thither
do yet refuse to receive the holy eucharist with us
as likewise of all those
who shall either say
or hear mass
and they shall in a more especial manner inquire oft all those
who are either dangerously active to seduce any persons from the communion of the church of england
or seditiously busy to dissuade his majesty &apos;s subjects from taking the oath of allegiance
together with all them who abused by their sophistry
refuse to take the said oath
and we straightly command all parsons
vicars
and curates
that they carefully
and severally present at all visitations
the names and surnames of the delinquents of these several kinds in their own parishes
under pain of suspension for six months
and likewise we straightly enjoin all churchwardens and the like sworn officers whatsoever
that by virtue of their oathes
they shall present at the said visitations the names of such persons
whom they know or hear of
or justly suspect to be delinquent
in all or any of these particulars
and that under the pains of the highest censures of the church
that so these delinquents may be legally cited
and being sound obstinate
they shall be excommunicated
and such excommunication shall be pronounced both in the cathedral church of the diocese
and in the several parishes where such recusants live
and every third month they shall be again publicly repeated in the places aforesaid
that all may take notice of those sentences
and because there are places which either have
or pretend to have exemptions
in which such delinquents do usually affect to make their abode
therefore we enjoin
that all bishops shall within their several dioceses
send unto such places one or more of their chaplains
or some of their officers whom they may rely on
to make strict inquiry after officers in those kinds
who diligently returning their information accordingly
the said bishop shall certify such informations to his metropolitan
that the aforesaid proceedings may forthwith issue from some higher courts in these cases
whereof by reason of the said exemptions the inferior courts can take no cognisance but if neither conferring nor censures will prevail with such persons
the church hath no way left but complaints to the secular power
and for them we enjoin
that all deans and arch-deacons
and all having inferior or exempt jurisdiction
shall every year within six months after any visitation by them holden
make certificate unto their several bishops
or archbishop
if it be within his diocese under their seal of office
of all such persons who have been presented unto them as aforesaid
under pain of suspension from their said jurisdictions by the space of one whole year
and we in like manner enjoin all archbishops and bishops
that once every year at the least
they certify under their episcopal seal in parchment
unto the justices of assize of every county in the circuits and within their dioceses respectively
the names and surnames not only of those who have been presented unto them from the said deans
archdeacons
&amp; c
but of those also who upon the oaths of churchwardens and other sworn men at their visitations
or upon the information of ministers employed in the said conferences
have been presented unto them
that so the said intended proceedings may have the more speedy and the more general success
in particular
it shall be carefully inquired into at all visitations under the oaths of the churchwardens and other sworn men
what recusants or popish persons have been either married or buried
or have had their children baptised otherwise then according unto the rules and forms established in the church of england
and the names of such delinquents if they can learn them
or otherwise such names as for the time they carry shall be as aforesaid given up to the bishop
who shall present them to the justices of assize
to be punished according to the statutes
and for the education of recusants children
since by canon already established
no man can teach school
no not in any private house except he be allowed by the ordinary of the place
and withal have subscribed to the articles of religion established in the church of england
we therefore straightly enjoin
that forthwith at all visitations there be diligent enquiry made by the churchwardens or other sworn ecclesiastical officers of each parish
under their oaths
who are employed
as schoolmasters to the children of recusants
and that their several names be presented to the bishop of the diocese
who citing the said schoolmasters shall make diligent search whether they have subscribed or no
and if they or any of them be found to refuse subscription
they shall be forbidden to teach hereafter
and censured for their former presumption
and withal the names of him or them that entertain such a schoolmaster
shall be certified to the bishop of the diocese
who shall at the next assize present them to the judges to be proceeded against according to the statutes
and if they subscribe
enquiry shall be made what care they take for the instruction of the said children in the catechism established in the book of common prayer
and all ordinaries shall censure those whom they find negligent in the said instruction
and if it shall appear
that the parents of the said children do forbid such schoolmasters to bring them up in the doctrine of the church of england
they shall notwithstanding do their duty
and if thereupon the said parents shall take away their children
the said schoolmasters shall forthwith give up their names unto the bishop of the diocese
who shall take care to return them to the justices of assize in manner and form aforesaid
and because some may cunningly elude this decree
by sending their children to be bred beyond the seas
therefore we ordain that the churchwardens and other sworn ecclesiastical officers shall likewise make careful enquiry
and give in upon their oaths at all visitations
the names of such recusants children
who are so sent beyond the seas to be bred there
or whom they probably suspect to be so sent
which names as aforesaid shall be given up to the bishop
and from him returned to the judges as aforesaid
that their parents
who so send them
may be punished according to law
provided always that this canon shall not take away or derogate from any power or authority already given or established by any other canon now in force
and all the said complaints or certificates shall be presented up to the judges in their several circuits by the bishop &apos;s register
or some other of his deputies immediately after the publishing of his majesty &apos;s commission
or at the end of the charge
which shall be then given by the judge
and this upon pain of suspension for three months
this sacred synod doth earnestly entreat the said reverend justices of assize
to be careful in the execution of the said laws committed to their trust
as they will answer to god for the daily increase of this gross kind of superstition
and further
we do also exhort all judges
whether ecclesiastical or temporall upon the like account
that they would not admit in any of their courts any vexatious complaint
suit or suits
or presentments against any minister
churchwardens
questmen
sidemen
or other church-officers for the making of any such presentments
and lastly
we enjoin that every bishop shall once in every year send into his majesty &apos;s high court of chancery
the names and surnames of all such recusants who have stood excommunicated beyond the time limited by the law
and shall desire that the writ might be at once sent out against them all ex officio
and for the better execution of this decree
this present synod doth most humbly beseech his most sacred majesty
that the officers of the said high court of chancery
whom it shall concern
may be commanded to send out the aforesaid writ from time to time as is desired
for that it would much exhaust the particular estates of the ordinaries
to sue out several writs at their own charge
and that the like command also may be laid upon the sheriffs and their deputies
for the due and faithful execution of the said writs
as often as they shall be brought unto them
and to the end that this canon may take the better and speedier effect
and not to be deluded or delayed
we further decree and ordain
that no popish recusant
who shall persist in the said sentence of excommunication
beyond the time prescribed by law
shall be absolved by virtue of any appeal in any ecclesiastical court
unless the said party shall first in his or her own person
and not by a proctor
take the usual oath
iv
against socinianism
whereas much mischief is already done in the church of god by the spreading of the damnable and cursed heresy of socinianism
as being a complication of many ancient heresies condemned by the four first general counsels
and contrariant to the articles of religion now established in the church of england
and whereas it is too apparent that the said wicked and blasphemous errors are unhappily dilated by the frequent divulgation and dispersion of dangerous books written in favour and furtherance of the same
whereby many
especially of the younger or unsettled sort of people
may be poisoned and infected
it is therefore decreed by this present synod
that no stationer
printer
or importer of the said books
or any other person whatsoever
shall print
buy
sell
or disperse any book
broaching or maintaining of the said abominable doctrine or positions
upon pain of excommunication ipso facto to be thereupon incurred
and we require all ordinaries upon pain of the censures of the church
that beside the excommunication aforesaid
they do certify their names and offences under their episcopal seal to the metropolitan
by him to be delivered to his majesty &apos;s attorney general for the time being
to be proceeded withal according to the late decree
in the honourable court of star-chamber
against spreaders of prohibited books
and that no preacher shall presume to vent any such doctrine in any sermon under pain of excommunication for the first offence
and deprivation for the second
and that no student in either of the universities of this land
nor any person in holy orders
excepting graduates in divinity
or such as have episcopal or archidiaconal jurisdiction
or doctors of law in holy orders shall be suffered to have or read any such socinian book or discourse
under pain if the offender live in the university that he shall be punished according to the strictest statutes provided there against the publishing
reading
or maintaining of false doctrine
or if he live in the city or country abroad
of a suspension for the first offence
and excommunication for the second
and deprivation for the third
unless he will absolutely and in terminis abjure the same
and if any layman shall be seduced into this opinion
and be convicted of it
he shall be excommunicated
and not absolved but upon due repentance and abjuration
and that before the metropolitan
or his own bishop at the least
and we likewise enjoin
that such books
if they be found in any prohibited hand
shall be immediately burned
and that there be a diligent search made by the appointment of the ordinary after all such books
in what hands soever
except they be now in the hands of any graduate in divinity
and such as have episcopal or archidiaconal jurisdiction
or any doctor of laws in holy orders as aforesaid
and that all who now have them
except before excepted
be strictly commanded to bring in the said books
in the universities to the vice-chancellors
and out of the universities to the bishops
who shall return them to such whom they dare trust with the reading of the said books
and shall cause the rest to be burned
and we farther enjoin
that diligent enquiry be made after all such that shall maintain and defend the aforesaid socinianism
and when any such shall be detected
that they be complained of to the several bishops respectively
who are required by this synod to repress them from any such propagation of the aforesaid wicked and detestable opinions
v
against sectaries
whereas there is a provision now made by a canon for the suppressing of popery and the growth thereof by subjecting all popish recusants to the greatest severity of ecclesiastical censures in that behalf
this present synod well knowing that there are other sects which endeavour the subversion both of the doctrine and discipline of the church of england no less than papists do
although by another way
for the preventing thereof doth hereby decree and ordain
that all those proceedings and penalties which are mentioned in the aforesaid canon against popish recusants as far as they shall be appliable
shall stand in full force and vigour against all anabaptists
brownists
separatists
familists
or other sect or sects
person or persons whatsoever
who do or shall
either obstinately refuse
or ordinarily
not having a lawful impediment that is
for the space of a month neglect to repair to their parish churches or chapels where they inhabit
for the hearing of divine service established
and receiving of the holy communion
according to law
and we do also further decree and ordain
that the clause contained in the canon now made by this synod against the books of socinianism
shall also extend to the makers
importers
printers
and publishers
or dispersers of any book
writing
or scandalous pamphlet devised against the discipline and government of the church of england
and unto the maintainers and abettors of any opinion or doctrine against the same
and further
because there are sprung up among us a sort of factious people
despisers and depravers of the book of common prayer
who do not according to the law resort to their parish church or chapel
to join in the public prayers
service
and worship of god with the congregation
contenting themselves with the hearing of sermons only
thinking thereby to avoid the penalties due to such as wholly absent themselves from the church
we therefore for the restraint of all such wilful contemners or neglecters of the service of god
do ordain that the church or chapel wardens
and questmen
or sidemen of every parish
shall be careful to inquire out all such disaffected persons
and shall present the names of all such delinquents at all visitations of bishops
and other ordinaries
and that the same proceedings and penalties mentioned in the canon aforesaid respectively
shall be used against them as against other recusants
unless within one whole month after they are first denounced
they shall make acknowledgement and reformation of that their fault
provided always
that this canon shall not derogate from any other canon
law
or statute in that behalf provided against those sectaries
vi
an oath enjoined for the preventing of all innovations in doctrine and government
this present synod being desirous to declare their sincerity and constancy in the profession of the doctrine and discipline already established in the church of england
and to secure all men against any suspicion of revolt to popery
or any other superstition decrees that all archbishops
and bishops
and all other priests and deacons in places exempt or not exempt
shall before the second day of november next ensuing take this oath following against all innovation of doctrine or discipline
and this oath shall be tendered them
and every of them
and all others named after in this canon
by the bishop in person
or his chancellor
or some grave divines named and appointed by the bishop under his seal
and the said oath shall be taken in the presence of a public notary
who is hereby required to make an act of it
leaving the universities to the provision which follows
the oath is
ay a
b
do swear
that i do approve the doctrine and discipline or government established in the church of england
as containing all things necessary to salvation
and that i will not endeavour by my self or any other
directly or indirectly
to bring in any popish doctrine
contrary to that which is so established
nor will i ever give my consent to alter the government of this church
by archbishops
bishops
deans
and arch-deacons
&amp; c
as it stands now established
and as by right it ought to stand
nor yet ever to subject it to the usurpations and superstitions of the sea of rome
and all these things i do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear
according to the plain and common sense and understanding of the same words
without any equivocation
or mental evasion
or secret reservation whatsoever
and this i do heartily
willingly
and truly
upon the faith of a christian
so help me god
in jesus christ
and if any man beneficed or dignified in the church of england
or any other ecclesiastical person shall refuse to take this oath
the bishop shall give him a monthes time to inform himself
and at the monthes end
if he refuse to take it
he shall be suspended ab officio
and have a second month granted
and if then he refuse to take it
he shall be suspended
and have a third month granted him for his better information
but if at the end of that month he refuse to take the oath abovenamed
he shall by the bishop be deprived of all his ecclesiastical promotions whatsoever
and execution of his function which he holds in the church of england
and we likewise constitute and ordain
that all masters of arts the sons of noblemen only excepted all bachelors and doctors in divinity
law
or physic
all that are licenced to practise physic
all registers
actuaries
and proctors
all schoolmasters
all such as being natives or naturalised
do come to be incorporated into the universities here
having taken a degree in any foreign university
shall be bound to take the said oath
and we command all governors of colleges and halls in either of the universities
that they administer this said oath to all persons resident in their several houses that have taken the degrees before mentioned in this canon
within six months after the publication hereof
and we likewise constitute
that all bishops shall be bound to give the said oath unto all those to whom they give holy orders
at the time of their ordination
or to whomsoever they give collation
institution
or licence to preach
or serve any cure
vii
a declaration concerning some rites and ceremonies
because it is generally to be wished
that unity of faith were accompanied with uniformity of practise
in the outward worship and service of god
chiefly for the avoiding of groundless suspicions of those who are weak
and the malicious aspersions of the professed enemies of our religion
the one fearing innovations
the other flattering themselves with a vain hope of our backslidings unto their popish superstition
by reason of the situation of the communion table
and the approaches thereunto
the synod declareth
as followeth that the standing of the communion table
sideway under the east window of every chancel
or chapel
is in its own nature indifferent
neither commanded nor condemned by the word of god
either expressly
or by immediate deduction
and therefore that no religion is to be placed therein
or scruple to be made thereon
and albeit at the time of reforming this church from that gross superstition of popery
it was carefully provided that all means should be used to root out of the minds of the people
both the inclination thereunto
and memory thereof
especially of the idolatry committed in the mass
for which cause all popish altars were demolished
yet notwithstanding it was then ordered by the injunctions and advertisements of queen elizabeth
of blessed memory
that the holy tables should stand in the place where the altars stood
and accordingly have been continued in the royal chapels of three famous and pious princes
and in most cathedral
and some parochial churches
which doth sufficiently acquit the manner of placing the said tables from any illegality
or just suspicion of popish superstition or innovation
and therefore we judge it fit and convenient
that all churches and chapels do conform themselves in this particular
to the example of the cathedral
or mother churches
saving always the general liberty left to the bishop by law
during the time of administration of the holy communion
and we declare that this situation of the holy table
doth not imply that it is
or aught to be esteemed a true and proper altar
whereon christ is again really sacrificed
but it is
and may be called an altar by us
in that sense in which the primitive church called it an altar
and in no other
and because experience hath showed us
how irreverent the behaviour of many people is in many places
some leaning
others casting their hats
and some sitting upon
some standing
and others sitting under the communion table in time of divine service
for the avoiding of these and the like
it is thought meet and convenient by this present synod
that the said communion tables in all chancels or chapels
be decently severed with rails to preserve them from such or worse profanations
and because the administration of holy things is to be performed with all possible decency and reverence
therefore we judge it fit and convenient
according to the word of the service-book established by act of parliament
draw near
&amp; c
that all communicants with all humble reverence shall draw near and approach to the holy table
there to receive the divine mysteries
which have heretofore in some places been unfitly carried up and down by the minister
unless it shall be otherwise appointed in respect of the incapacity of the place
or other inconvenience by the bishop himself in his jurisdiction
and other ordinaries respectively in theirs
and lastly
whereas the church is the house of god
dedicated to his holy worship
and therefore ought to mind us
both of the greatness and goodness of his divine majesty
certain it is that the acknowledgement thereof
not only inwardly in our hearts
but also outwardly with our bodies
must needs be pious in it self
profitable unto us
and edifying unto others
we therefore think it very meet and behooveful
and heartily commend it to all good and well affected people
members of this church
that they be ready to tender unto the lord the said acknowledgement
by doing reverence and obeisance
both at their coming in
and going out of the said churches
chancels
or chapels
according to the most ancient custom of the primitive church in the purest times
and of this church also for many years of the reign of queen elizabeth
the reviving therefore of this ancient and laudable custom
we heartily commend to the serious consideration of all good people
not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the communion table
the east
or church
or any thing therein contained in so doing
or to perform the said gesture
in the celebration of the holy eucharist
upon any opinion of a corporal presence of the body of jesus christ
on the holy table
or in the mystical elements
but only for the advancement of god &apos;s majesty
and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him
and no otherwise
and in the practice or omission of this rite
we desire that the rule of charity prescribed by the apostle
may be observed
which is
that they which use this rite despise not them who use it not
and that they who use it not
condemn not those that use it
viii
of preaching for conformity
wheras the preaching of order and decency
according to st paul &apos;s rule
doth conduce to edification
it is required
that all preachers as well beneficed men as others shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the people in their public sermons twice in the year at the least
that the rites and ceremonies now established in the church of england are lawful and commendable
and that they the said people and others
aught to conform themselves in their practice to all the said rites and ceremonies
and that the people and others ought willingly to submit themselves unto the authority and government of the church as it is now established under the king &apos;s majesty
and if any preacher shall refuse or neglect to do according to this canon
let him be suspended by his ordinary
during the time of his refusal
or wilful forbearance to do thereafter
ix
one book of articles of inquiry to be used at all parochial visitations
for the better settling of an uniformity in the outward government and administration of the church
and for the more preventing of just grievances which may be laid upon churchwardens and other sworn-men
by any impertinent
inconvenient
or illegal inquiries in the articles for ecclesiastical visitations
this synod hath now caused a summary or collection of articles out of the rubrics of the service-book
and the canons and warrantable rules of the church to be made
and for future direction to be deposited in the records of the archbishop of canterbury
and we do decree and ordain
that from henceforth no bishop or other person whatsoever having right to hold
use
or exercise any parochial visitation
shall under the pain of a monthes suspension upon a bishop
and two months upon any other ordinary that is delinquent
and this to be incurred ipso facto cause to be printed or published
or otherwise to be given in charge to the church-warden
or to any other persons which shall be sworn to make
any other articles or forms of enquiry upon oath
than such only as shall be approved and in unto him upon due request made by his metropolitan under his seal of office
provided always that after the end of three years &apos; next following the date of these presents
the metropolitan shall not either at the instance of those which have right to hold parochial visitations
or upon any other occasion
make any addition or diminution from that allowance to any bishop
of visitatory articles
which he did last before in any diocese
within his province approve of
but calling for the same shall hold and give that only for a perpetual rule
and then every parish shall be bound only to take the said book from the arch-deacons and other having a peculiar or exempt jurisdiction
but once from that time
in three years
in case they do make it appear that they have the said book remaining in their public for the use of the parish
and from every bishop they shall receive the said articles at the episcopal visitation only
and in manner and form as formerly they have been accustomed to do
and at no greater price than what hath been usually paid in the said diocese respectively
x
concerning the conversation of the clergy
the sober
grave and exemplary conversation of all those that are employed in administration of holy things
being of great avail for the furtherance of piety it hath been the religious care of the church of england
strictly to enjoin to all &amp; every one of her clergy
a pious
regular
and inoffensive demeanour and to prohibit all loose and scandalous carriage by severe censures to be inflicted upon such delinquents
as appears by the 74
and 75
canons anno 1603
provided to this purpose
for the more affectual success of which pious and necessary care
this present synod
straightly charges all clergy men in this church
that setting before their eyes the glory of god
the holiness of their calling
and the edification of the people committed to them
they carefully avoid all excess and disorder
and that by their christian and religious conversation they shine forth as lights unto others in all godliness and honesty
and we also require all those to whom the government of the clergy of this church is committed
that they set themselves to countenance and encourage godliness
gravity
sobriety
and all unblameable conversation in the ministers of this church
and that according to the power with which they are entrusted
they diligently labour by the due execution of the above named canons
and all other ecclesiastical provisions made for this end
to reform all offensive and scandalous persons
if any be in the ministry
as they tender the welfare and prospering of piety and religion
and as they will answer to god for those scandals
which through their remissness and neglect shall arise and grow in this church of christ
xi
chancellors patents
for the better remedying and redress of such abuses as are complained of in the ecclesiastical courts
the synod doth decree and ordain
that hereafter no bishop shall grant any patent to any chancellor
commissary
or official
for any longer term
than the life of the grantee only
nor otherwise then with express reservation to himself
and his successors
of the power to execute the said place
either alone
or with the chancellor
if the bishop shall please to do the same
saving always to the said chancellors
&amp; c
the fees accustomably taken for executing the said jurisdiction
and that in all such patents
the bishop shall keep in his own hands the power of institution unto benefices
as also of giving licenses to preach or keep school
and further
that no dean and chapter confirm any patent of any chancellor
commissaries
or officials place
wherein the said conditions are not expressed
to the dean or his locum tenens if he pass the act in his absence and to every canon
or prebendary
voting to the confirmation of the said act
to be inflicted by the archbishop of the province
and further
the holy synod doth decree and ordain that no reward shall be taken for any chancellors
commissaries or officials place under the heaviest censures of the church
xii
chancellors alone not to censure any of the clergy in sundry cases
that no chancellor
commissary
or official
unless he be in holy orders
shall proceed to suspension
or any higher censure against any of the clergy in any criminal cause
other than neglect of appearance
upon legal citing
but that all such causes shall be heard by the bishop in person
or with the assistance of his chancellor
or commissary
or if the bishops occasions will not permit
then by his chancellor
or commissary
and two grave dignified
or beneficed ministers of the diocese to be assigned by the bishop
under his episcopal seal
who shall hear and censure the said cause in the consistory
xiii
excommunication and absolution not to be pronounced but by a priest
that no excommunications or absolutions shall be good or valid in law
except they be pronounced
either by the bishop in person
or by some other in holy orders
having ecclesiastical jurisdiction
or by some grave minister beneficed in the diocese
being a master of arts
at least
and appointed by the bishop
and the priest &apos;s name pronouncing such sentence of excommunication
or absolution to be expressed in the instrument issuing under seal out of the court
and that no such minister shall pronounce any sentence of absolution but in open consistory
or at the least in a church or chapel
the penitent humbly craving and taking absolution upon his knees
and having first taken the oath
and that no parson
vicar
or curate
shall declare any of his or their parishioners to be excommunicate
or shall admit any of them so excommunicate into the church
and there declare them to be absolved
except they first receive such excommunications and absolutions under the seal of the ecclesiastical judge
from whom it cometh
xiiii
concerning commutations
and the disposing of them
that no chancellor
commissary
or official
shall have power to commute any penance in whole
or in part
but either together with the bishop in person
or with his privity in writing
or if by himself
there he shall give up a full and just account of all such commutations once every year
at michaelmas to the bishop
who shall with his chancellor
see that all such moneys be disposed of to charitable and public uses
according to law
and if any chancellor or other
having jurisdiction
as aforesaid
shall not make such a just account to the bishop
and be found guilty of it
he shall be suspended from all exercise of his jurisdiction
for the space of one whole year
always provided
that if the crime be publicly complained of
and do appear notorious
that then the office shall signify to the place
from whence the complaint came
that the delinquent hath satisfied the church for his offence
and the minister shall signify it as he shall be directed
saving always to all chancellors
and other ecclesiastical officers their due and accustomable fees
if he or they be not so suspended as aforesaid
xv
touching concurrent jurisdictions
that in such places wherein there is concurrent jurisdiction
no executor be cited into any court or office
for the space of ten days after the death of the testator
and that aswell every apparitor herein
as every register
or clerk that giveth or carrieth out any citation or process to such intent
before that the said ten days be expired
shall for the first offence herein
be suspended from the execution of his office
for the space of three months
and for the second offence
in this kind
be and stand excommunicated
ipso facto
not to be restored
but by the metropolitan of the province
or his lawful surrogate
and that yet nevertheless
it be lawful for any executor
to prove such wills when they think good
within the said ten days
before any ecclesiastical judge respectively
to whose jurisdiction the same may
or doth appertain
xvi
concerning licences to marry
whereas divers licences to marry
are granted by ordinaries
in whose jurisdiction
neither of the parties
desiring such licence
is resident
to the prejudice of the archiepiscopal prerogative
to whom only the power of granting such licences
to parties of any jurisdiction
by law belongeth
and for other great inconveniences thereupon ensuing
it is therefore decreed
that no licence of marriage shall be granted by any ordinary to any parties
unless one of the said parties have been commorant in the jurisdiction of the said ordinary
for the space of one whole month
immediately before the said licence be desired
and if any ordinary shall offend herein
and be sufficiently evinced thereof
in any of the lord archbishops courts
he shall be liable to such censure as the lord archbishop shall think fit to inflict
and we further decree
that one of the conditions in the bond of security given by the parties taking such licence
shall be
that the said party
or one of them
have
or hath been a month commorant in the said jurisdiction
immediately before the said licence granted
and the synod decrees
that whatsoever is ordered in these six last canons
concerning the jurisdiction of bishops
their chancellors
and commissaries
shall so far as by law is appliable be in force
concerning all deans
deans and chapters
collegiate churches
archdeacons
and all in holy orders
having exempt
or peculiar jurisdiction
and their several officers respectively
xvii
against vexatious citations
and that this synod may prevent all grievances
which may fall upon the people by citations into ecclesiastical courts
upon pretence only of the breach of law
without either
or any other just ground

that for all times to come no such citation
grounded only as aforesaid
shall issue out of any ecclesiastical court
except the said citation be sent forth under the hand and seal of the chancellor
commissary
archdeacon
or other competent judge of the said court
within thirty days after the fault committed
and return thereof to be mode the next
or second court day after the citation served at the farthest
and that the party so cited
unless he be convinced by two witnesses
shall
upon the denial of the fact upon oath
be forthwith freely dismissed without any payment of fees
provided that this decree exceed not to any grievous crime
as schism
incontinency
misbehaviour in the church in time of divine service
obstinate inconformity
or the like

a dialogue or communication of two persons
devised and set forth in the latin tongue
by the noble and famous clerk
desiderius erasmus entitled the pilgrimage of pure devotion
newly translated into english
to the reader
amongst the writings of all men
dearly beloved reader
not only of the diversity of tongues
but also the noble draught of so artificial painted figures
which have so lively expressed to the quick image
the nature
order
and proportion of all states
as concerning the governance of a christian commonwealth
that there is as i suppose no part of the scripture
which is not so furnished
and set forth
but that every christian man
thereby learn his duty to god
his prince
and his neighbour
and so consequently pass thorough the straight path of the which scripture doth testify upon
very few can find the entry
whereby through faith in the redemption of the world thorough the blood of christ the son of god
to rain with the father eternally
according to the promise of christ
saying
in my father &apos;s hawse there be many places to dwell in
we will come to him and make a mansion place with him and i have and shall open thy name unto them
that the same love with the which thou lovedest me
may be in them
and i in them
and this is the kingdom of god so often moved to us in holy scripture
which all faithful shall possess and inherit for evermore
where as the unfaithful
and sinner shall not enter in to the kingdom of god
because
of changing the glory of good immortal in to the image of a corruptible man
and therefore so licentiously he hath suffered them to wander in their clouds of ignorance
preferring the lies and corrupt judgements of man the verity and the truth of god
rather serving the creature than the creator
amongst all the parties of the which as was spoken at the beginning this alway not alonely in the new law
but also in the old testament was as a thing most abominable and displeasant in the sight of good prohibit and forbidden
but our nature which hath in him
the damnable repugnance of sin against the omnipotent power of good
left even from hour first father adam
is so inclined to vices
amongst the which it hath not given the least part to this desperate sin of idolatry
against the immaculate
and fearful commandment of god
thou shalt have no strange god ’ s in my sight
that it is sore to be dreaded the same judgement to be given upon us that was given upon the city of ninive to be absorbed of the earth in to the ire and venge of good
which hath been the cause that so many writers
and many years passed
have even to death
resisted these damnable bolsterers of idolatry
given their selves to the cross in example of reformation to their brethren
both in writing and counsel
exhorting the flock of christ from such profane doctrine
amongst whom the noble and famous clerk desiderius erasmus hath set forth to the quick image
before men &apos;s eyes
the superstitious worship and false honour given to bones
heads
jaws
arms
stocks
stones
shirts
smokes
coats
caps
hats
shoes
mitres
slippers
saddles
ridge &apos;s
beads
girdles
bowls
bells
oakes
gioves
ropes
raperes
candles
boots
spurs my breath was almost past me with many other such damnable allusions of the devil to use theme as gods contrary to the immaculate scripture of good
moreover he noteth as it were of arrogancy the private judgmegt of certain that of their own brain would cast out images of the temple
with out a common consent and authority
some there be that always seek hallows
and go upon pilgrimages under a pretence of holiness
whereupon these brotherhoods and sisterhoods be now invented
moreover they that have been at jerusalem be called knights of the sepulchre
and call one an other brethren
and upon they play the fools sadly
drawing after them an ass in a rope
when they be not much distant from the wooden ass that they draw
the same do they counterfeit that have been at saint james in compostella
but they be more pernicious
that set forth uncertain relics
for certain
and attribute more to them than they ought to have
and prostitute or set them forth for filthy
but now when they perceive
that this their damnable , a treasure box of the jews corbane doth decay
and that their most to be lamented blindness and long accustomed errors should be redressed
they
all fair both of god and man set aside
rebel and make insurrections contrary to the ordinance of good
against their king and liege lord
provoking and alluring the simple commonalty to their damnable hypocrisy and conspiracy
minding and going about to prevent our most sovereign lords judgement
not yet given upon their sodomitical acts
and most horrible hypocrisy
but the word of the lord which they so tyrannously go about to suppress with all the faverours thereof shall overcome and destroy all such most to be abhorred and deceivable inveiglers and disturbers of the simple people to such detestable treason
and that it may so do to the terrible example of these and all other rebels and most disloyal subjects
and to the great comfort and consolation of his graces faithful and true commons
i require him which breatheth where he willith and reigneth eternal good to grant unto our said most dread sovereign lord whose majesty as it evidently appeareth only applieth his diligence to the advancing and setting forth of the most wholesome document and teaching of almighty god
to the redress of long accustom evils and damnable sects
to the supportation and maintenance of godly and allowable ceremonies
to the suppressing and most to be desired abolishing of the devilish and detestable usurped authorities
damnable errors and profane abuses brought in by that mighty golias
that obdurated phareo
that proud nembroth whom god amend the bishop of rome
to grant i say unto his highness
such his godly aid and assistance
that his grace with his most honourable counsel against whom this arrogant conspiracy is now moved and begun may overcome and debelle the stud traitress as in times passed his majesty hath prudency do other
that have heretofore attempted to perpetrate and bring to pass like seditious mischief
and so to establish the hearts of his graces true subjects that they may willingly and according to their duties
obey and fulfil his most lawful and godly ordained laws and commandments whereby they shall not only do the thing agreeable to god &apos;s will and teachings
in that he willeth every soul to be subjected to the higher power and obedient to their prince
but also to their great laud and praise shall show them self to be ready and confirmable to do their duties in aiding his excellent highness to the reformation of all pernicious abuses and chief of detestable idolatry
which is so much prohibited in holy scripture and most displeasant to god
for which intent and purpose the said most noble and famous clerk desiderius erasmus
compiled and made this dialogue in latin
as it followeth her after now lately translated into our mother the english tongue
avoid therefore
most dear reader
all abuses whereby any inconvenience may grow
other to the hindrance of gods word
to the displeasure of thy prince
whom thou art so straightly commanded to obey
or to the damage of a public weal
which above all vices is noted most to be abhorred
not alonely of the most holy writers and expounders of scripture
but also of profane gentiles
which never perceived other thing than nature inclined their hearts unto
and so consequently to obtain the fruition of the godhead thorough the faith that was spoken of at the beginning to the which the lord jesus christ bring us all with a perfect quietness
so be it
a pilgrimage for pure devotion
signifieth to forsake
what new thing is it
that i see
do i not see gyus my neighbour
whom no man could espy of all these six months before
it was a saying that he was deed
it is even he
except that i be far deceived
i will go to him
and bid him good morrow
good morrow , was feigned of an old king of thebans
good morrow to you
i pray you from what contrary do you come to us again so safe
for here was a great communication that you did sail straightly to hell
thanked be god
i have fared as well sins i went hens
as ever i did in all my life
well
a man may well perceive that all such rumours be but vanity
but i pray you what array is this that you be in
me think that you be clothed with cockle shells
and you be prettily garnished with wreaths of straw and your arm is full of
walsyngam is called para thalassic by cause it is nigh to the see
snakes eggs
i have been on pilgrimage at saint james in compostella
and at my return i did more religiously visit our lady of walsyngam in england
a very holy pilgrimage
but i did rather visit her
for i was there before within this three year
my mother in law did make a vow that if her daughter should be delivered of a man child alive
than that i should go to saint james on pilgrimage
and there to salute and thank him
did you salute saint james alonely in your name
and your mothers
no
in the name of all hour house
verily i think that your household as well should have prospered
in case you had not saluted him at all
but i pray you what answer did he make to your salutation
nothing at all
but when i did offer
me taught he did laugh upon me
and beck at me with his head
and did reach to me this cockleshell
wherefore doth he give rather such shells
than other things
for the see
which is nigh unto him doth minister plenty of such
o holy saint james
that both is a midwife to women with child
and also doth help his pilgrims
but i pray you what new kind of making vows is that that when a man is idle he shall put the burden upon an other man &apos;s back
in case that you do bind your self with a vow
that if the matter chance happily which you have in hand
that i for you shall fast twice in on week
do you believe that i can fulfil your vow
no
i do not believe it if that you did vow it in your own name
it is but a sport with you to mock saints
but this was my mother in law
i must needs obey her
you know women ’ s affections
and i must obey heres
if that you had not performed your vow
what had you be in
i grant
he could not have had an action against me in the law
but he might fromhenceforth be deaf to my vows
orelse privily send some calamity or wretchedness amongst my household
you know well enough the manners of great men
tell me now what that same honest man saint james doth
and how he fareth
much colder than he was wonted to do
what is the cause of it
his age
oh you scoffer
you know well enough that saints wax not old
but this new learning
which runneth all the world over now a days
doth cause him to be visited much less than he was wonted to be
for if any do come they salute him alonely
but they offer little or nothing
and say that their money may better be disposed amongst poor people
o a wicked communication
ye and so great an apostle which was wonted to stand all in precious stones and gold
now standeth all of wood having before him scarcely a wax candle
if it be true that i here
it is great jeopardy lest that same chance to all the rest of the saints
i think it well
for there is an epistle abroad which our lady did write upon the same matter
what lady
our lady of stone in raurachia which is a certain country
she that hath her name of a stone
i traw it is in raurachia
that same is it
you tell me of a stony lady
but to whom did she write
the epistle doth plainly show his name
by whom was it sent
no doubt but by an angel
which did lay the writings upon the altar
whereof he preacheyth to whom it was sent
and lest there should be any suspection of crafty conveyance in you
you shall see the epistle written with his own hand
do you know so well the hand of the angel which is secretary to our lady
ye why not
by what argument
i have red that is a scripture written on a grave
epitaph of bede which was graved of the angel
and the letters agree in all things
i have redden also the obligation which was sent to saint gyles as doth aper
doth not these arguments prove that matter to be good enough
may a man look upon them
ye and if you will swear to keep it privy
oh you shall speak to a stone
there be stones now a days of that name very slanderous
that will hide nothing
you shall speak to a dumb man
and you trust not a stone
upon that condition i will tell it
look that you here with both your ears
so i do
the epistle of our lady
mary the mother of jesus to glaucoplutus desirus of riches
glaucoplutus sendeth greeting
insomuch as you follow luther
you nobly persuade
that it is but in vain to call upon saints
do ye well know for that to be greatly in my favour
for until this day i have almost be slain with the importunate prayers of men
of me alone they asked all things
as who should say my son were always a babe
because he is so feigned and painted upon my breast
that yet he would be at my commandment and durst not deny my petition
dreading that if he deny my petition
that i should deny him mite ate when he is a thirst
and veryoft they require that of me
which a shamefast youngman dare scantly ask of a bawd
ye they be such things as i am ashamed to put in writing
now cometh the merchantman and he ready to sail into spain for a vantage
doth commit his wives honesty to me
than commeth that little pretty nun and she casteth away her veil ready to run away
she leaveth with me the good name of her virginity
which shortly she intendeth to take money for
than crieth the wicked soldier purposed to rob and saith
blessed lady send me a good pray
now commeth the unthrifty diasser and crieth
send me good chance lady and thou shalt have part of my winnings
and if the diasse run against him
he blasphemes
and curseth me
because i will not favour his naughtiness
now crieth she that selleth her self for filthy lucre and saith
sweet lady send me some customers
and if i deny it
they exclaim against me and say
thou art not the mother of mercy
moreover the vows of some women be no less wicked than foolish
the maid crieth and saith
o sweat mary send me a fair and rich husband
the married woman saith send me goodly children
now laboreth the woman with child
and crieth dear lady deliver me of my bonds
than commeth the old wife
and saith flower of all women send me to live long without cough and dryness
now crepeth the doting oldman and saith
lady send me for to wax young again
than commeth forth the philosopher and crieth send me some arguments that be insoluble
the great priest crieth send me a fat benefice
than saith the bishop keep well my church
than crieth the high justice show me thy son or i pass out of this world
than saith the courtier send me true confession at the hour of my death
the husbandman saith send us temperate weather
the milk wife crieth out blessed lady save our cattle
now if i deny anything by and by
if i commit it to me soon
i hear them say
he will what so ever you will
shall i than alone both a woman and a maid help mariners
sawed years
merchantmen
diassers
marriedmen
women with child
judges
kings
and husbandmen
ye and this that i have said is the least part of my pain
but i am not now so much troubled with such business
for that i would heartily thank you
but that this commodity doth bring a greater discommodity with him
i have now more ease
but less honour and profit
before this time i was called queen of heaven
lady of the world
but now any man will scarcely say ave maria or hail mary
before i was clothed with precious stones and gold
and had my changes
and daily there was offered gold and precious stones
now i am scarcely covered with half a gown and that is all beeyten with miss
my yearly rents be now so small that i am scarcely able to find my poor quere keeper to light a wax candle before me
yet all this might be suffered
but you be about to pluke away greater things
you be about as they say that what so ever any saint hath in any place
to take it from the churches
but take heed what you do
for there is no saint without a way to revenge his wrong
if you cast saint petre forth of the church
he may serve you of the same sauce
and shit up heavengates against you
ye saint paul hath his sword
bartholomew is not without his great knife
saint william is harkened under his monks cloak
not without a great spear
what canst thou do against saint george which is both a knight and all armed with his long spear and his fearful sword
nor saint antony is not without his weapons for he hath holy fire which him
ye the rest of the saints have their weapons or mischievous
which they send upon whom they list
but as for me thou canst not cast out
except thou cast out my son
which i hold in mine arms
i will not be separate from him
other thou shalt cast him out with me orelse thou shalt let us both be
except that you would have a temple without a christ
these be the things that i would you shall know imagined you therefore what shall be your answer
for this thing pleaseth me very well
from our stony church the kalends of august
the year from my sons passion
i stony lady subscribed this with mine own hand
truly that was a sorrow and fearful epistle
i suppose that glaucoplutus will beware fronhensforthe
ye and if he be wise
wherefore did not that good saint james write to that man of the same matter
i can not tell
except it be because he is so far of
and now a days men be much searched for such matters
and in their iornaye their letters taken from them
i pray you
what god did send you into england
i saw the wind marvellous prosperous thitherward
and i had almost promised this to that blessed lady of walsyngan that i would seek her within two year
what would you axe of her
no new thing at all
but such as be common
as to keep safe and sound my household
to increase my goods
and in this world to have along and merry life
and when i die everlasting life in another world
may not our lady grant the same at home with us
she hath at antwerp a much more lordly temple than at walsynganie
i deny not but it may be so
but in divers places she grants divers things
weather it be her pleasure so to do
or because she is so gentle
that as concerning this purpose
she will give her self to our affections
i have hard oft of saint james
but i pray you describe to me the kingdom of walsyngam
verily i shall tell you as shortly as i can
it is the most holy name in all england
and you may find some in that
that suppose their substance shall not prosper except they visit her with their offering every year once as they be able to give
where doth she dwell
at the uttermost part of all england betwixt the north and the west
not vary far from the see
scarcely iij miles
the town is almost sustained by the resort of pilgrims
the college is of canon &apos;s
but they be such as hath their name of the latin tongue and be called seculares
a kind betwixt monks and chanones
such as the monster fyber is abeste of the see and the land
fyber is
no they be rather such as the a cockatrice will kill a man with a look
cockatrice
but without dissimulation
i shall put you out of this doubt in three words
to them that they hate
they be chanones
and to them that they love they he monks menede
yet you do not open this redle
i shall paint it before your eyes
if the bishop of rome do shot his thunderbolt amongst all monks
they will then be chanones
and not monks
but and if he would suffer all monks to take wives
than will they be monks
o new partakers
i would to god they would take away my wife
but to come to our purpose
the college hath scarcely any other renttes
emolumentes but of the liberality of our lady
for the great offerings be keeped still
but if there be any little some of money offered that goith to the commons of the company
and the master whom they call prior
be they of a virtuous life
nat to be dispraised
they be more virtuous than rich of their yearly rents
the temple is goodly and gorgeous
but our lady dwelleth not in it
but that was purchased for the honour of her son
she hath her own temple
that she may be of the right hand of her soon
upon the right-hand
which way doth her son look than
it is well remembered
when he lokethe to the west
his mother is upon his right hand
but when he turneth him to the este she is upon the left hand
but yet she dwelleth not in that church
for it is not yet builded all up
and the wind runneth thorough every part with open windows and doors
and also not far of is the ocean say father of all winds
what do you tell me where doth she dwell than
in the same church which i told you was not all finished
there is a little chapel sealed over with wood
on either side a little door where the pilgrims go thorough
there is little light
but of the tapers
with a fragrant smell
all these be meet for religion
ye menedemus if you look within you will say that it is a seat meet for saints
all things be so bright with gold
silver
and precious stones
you almost move me to go thither also
it shall not repent you of your journey
springeth there no holy oil
i trow you dote
that springeth not but out of the sepulchres of saints
as saint andrew
and saint kateren
our lady was not buried
i grant i said amiss
but tell on your tale
so much more as they perceive your devotion
so much larger relics will they show to you
ye and peradventure that they may have larger offerings
as is said that
many little offerings maketh a heavy box
gy
her chaplains be always at hand
be they of the chanones
no
they be not permitted to be with her
lest that peradventure by occasion of that religion
they should be plucked from their own religion
and whilst they keep that virgin
they regard very little their own virginity
alonely in that inner chapel which is our ladies privy chamber
there standeth a certain cannon at the altar
for what purpose
to receive and keep
that which is offered
doth any man give against his will
no
but many men hath such a gentle shamefastness
that they will give some thing to him that standeth by
other they will offer more largely
which that would not do peradventure if that he were absent
that standeth there
you tell me of man &apos;s affections
which i my self proved very oft
ye truly there be some so given to our blessed lady
that when they appear to putup their hands to offer
with a proper conveyance
they stail that which other men hath given
than let no man be there
will not our lady shoot her thunderbolt at such
wherefore should our lady rather do so
than god himself
whom they be not afraid to pluck out his robes
and break the church walls therefore
i am in a great doubt whether i should
rather marvel upon the air wicked boldness
or gods great gentleness and long suffering
apon the north part there is a certain gate
but lest that you should make a lie
it is not of the church
but of the pale that compasseth a bout the church yard
and that hath a little wicket
such as be in great men &apos;s gates
that who so ever will entre
must first putin his leg
not without some jeopardy
and than bow down his head
it is jeopardy to go thorough such a door
to a man &apos;s enemy
so it is
the sexton did tell me that there was once a knight which fleeing his enemy
than approaching
did ride thorough the wicket
and than the wretch despairing in him self
upon a sudden motion
did commend himself to the blessed virgin
which was than at hand
but now commeth the miracle
by and by that knight was all in the church yard
and his adversary was raging at the door withowte
and did he tell you so marvellous a miracle for a truth
no doubt
but i suppose that he could not so lightly do that to you so a great a philosopher
he did show to me in that same wicket in a plate of copper
the image of the knight fastened with nails and with the same garments that the englishmen were wonted to wear at that time
as you may see in that old pictures
which will not lie
barbourꝭ had but little living at that time
and dieres and websteres got but little money
why so
for he had a beard like a goat
and his cote had never a plight
and it was so little
that with straight girding it maid his body to appear less than it was
there was another plate
that was in quantity and form like to a chest
well now it is not to be doubted upon
under the wicket there was a grate of iron
that no man can pass therein but a footman
for it is not convenient that any horse should tread after upon the place
which the knight did consecrated to our lady
nat without a good cause
from that part toward the este
there is a little chapel
full of marvels and thither i went
there was i received of another of our ladies chaplenes
there we kneeled down
to make our little prayers
by and by
he brought for the the joint of a man &apos;s finger
the greatest of three
which i kissed
and asked whose relics they were
he did say that they were saint petres
what the apostle said i
ye said he
than i did better behold the joint
which for his greatness might well have be a giants joint
rather than a man &apos;s
than said i
saint peter must needs be a great man of stature
but at that word
there was one of the gentlemen that stood by
that could not forbear laughing
for the which i was very sorry
for if he had holden his peace
we had seen all the relics
yet we meetly well pleased master sexton
with giving him two or three groats
before that chapel there was a little house
which he said once in winter time when that there was little room to cover the relics
that it was suddenly brought and set in that place
under that house there was a couple of pits
both full of water to the brinks
and they say that the spring of those pits is dedicated to our lady
that water is very cold
and medicinable for the heed ache and that heartburning
if that cold water will hele the pains in the heed and stomach
than will oil putout fire from henceforth
it is a miracle that i tell
good sir
orelse what marvel should it be
that cold water should slake thirst
this may well be one part of your tale
they say that the fountain did suddenly spring out of the earth at the commandment of our lady
and i diligently examining all things
did ask him how many years it was sith that house was so suddenly brought thither
many years agone saith he
yet
said i
the walls do not apere so old
he did not deny it
no mor these wooden pilers
he cold not deny but that they were set there not long ago
and also the matter did plainly testify the same
afterward
said i
this roof which is all of reed doth appear not to be very old
and he granted also
these greet beams which lie overthwerte
and these rafters that hold up that house were not set long agone
he affirmed my saying
well said i saying that no part of the house is left but all is new
how can you say that this was the house which was brought hither so long ago
i pray you how did the housekeeper
avoid himself from your argument
by and by he did show to us the matter by the skin of a bayre which had hanged be the rafters along season
and did almost mock the simpleness of hour wits that could not perceive so manifest an argument we being persuaded by this argument
asked pardon of our ignorance
and called into our communication the heavenly milk of our lady
o how like to the son is the mother
for he hath left to us so much blood here in earth
and she so much milk
that a man will scarcely believe a woman to have so much milk of one child
in case the child should suck none at all
they say the same of the holy cross
which is showed in so many places both openly
and privately
that if the fragments were gathered upon one heap
they would appear to be a just fraught for a ship
and yet christ did bear all his cross himself
but do not you marvel at this
it may well be a strange thing
but no marvel
saying that the lord which doth increase this at his pleasure
is almighty
it is very gently expounded
but i am afraid
that many of these be feigned for lucre
i suppose that god would not suffer himself to be deluded of such a fashion
yis
have not you seen that when both the mother
the son
the father
and the holy ghost hath be robbed of these sacrilegious thieves
that they would not ones move
or stir neither with bekke or crakke whereby they might fray away the thieves
so great is the gentles of god
so it is
but here out me tale
this milk is keeped upon the high altar
and in the mids there is christ
which his mother upon his right hand
for her honour sake
the milk doth represent the mother
it may be seen then
it is closed in crystal
it is moist than
what tell you me of moistness
when it was milked more than a thousand and five hunthrithe year agone
it is so congealed
that a man would say that it were chalk tempered with the white of a egg
ye
but do they set it forth bare
no
lest so holy milk should be defouled with the kissing of men
you say well
for i suppose that there be many that kiss it
which be neither clean mouthed
nor yet be pure virgins
when the sexton saw us
he did run to the altar
and put upon him his surplus
and his stole about his neck
kneeled down religiously
and worshipped it
and streghtforthe did offer the milk to us to kiss
and at the end of the altar we kneeled down devoutly
and the first of all we saluted christ
and than after we called upon our lady with this prayer
which we had maid ready for the same purpose
o mother and maid
which did give suck with thy virgins teats the lord of heaven and earth
thy son jesus christ
we being purified thorough his precious blood
do desire that we may attain
and come to that blessed infancy of thy colombine &apos;s meekness
which is immaculate without malice
fraud or deceit
and with all affection of heart doth covet and study for the heavenly milk of the evangelical doctrine
to go for the and increase with it into a perfect man
into the measure of the plentifulness of christ
of whose company thou haste the fruition
together with the father
and the holy ghost for evermore
so be it
verily this is a holy prayer
but what did she
and me thought that the milk danced
in the meanseson the sexton came to us
without any words
but he held out a table such as the germans use to gather tolle upon bridges
by my troth i have cursed very oft such craving boxes
when i did ride thorough germany
we did give him certain money which he offered to our lady
than i axed by a certain young man
that was well learned
which did expound and tell us the saying of the sexton
his name as fere as i remember was robert alderisse
by what tokens or arguments he did know that it was the milk of our lady
and that i very fain
and for a good purpose desired to know
that i might stoup the mouths of certain newfangled fellows
first of all the sexton with a froward countenance would not tell
but i desired the young man to move him more instantly
but somewhat more gently he so courteously behaved himself
that and he had prayed our lady herself after that fashion
she would not have be displeased therewith
and than this mystical chaplain
as and if he had be inspired with the holy ghost
casting at us a frowning look
as and if he would have shoot at us the horrible thunderbolt of the great curse
what need you saith he to move such questions
when you see before your eyes so authentical and old a table
and we were afraid lest that he would have cast us out of the church for heretics
but that our money did temper his great
what did you in the mean season
what suppose you
we were amassed as and if a man had strike us with a club
or we had be slain with a thunderclap
and we very lowly axid pardon of our foolish boldness
and got us from thence
for so must we entreat holy things
from thence we went in to the house where hour lady dwelleth
and when we came there
we saw another sexton which was but a novice
he looked familiarly as and if he had known us
and when we came a little further in
we saw another
that looked much after such a fashion
at the last came the third
peradventure they desired to describe you
but i suspect another matter
what was it
there was a certain thief that had stole almost all our ladies frontlet
and i supposed that they had me in suspicion thereof
and therefore when i was within the chapel i maid my prayers to our lady after this fashion
oh chief of all women mary the maid
most happy mother
most pure virgin
we unclean
and sinners
do visit the pure and holy
and after our ability we have offered unto thee
we pray thy that thy son may grant this to us
that we may follow thy holy life
and that we may deserve thorough the grace of the holy ghost
spiritually to conceive the lord jesus christ
and after that conception never to be separate from him
amen
this done i kissed the altar
and laid down certain groats for mine offering and went my way
what died our lady now
did not she make one sign
that you might know that she had hard your prayers
the light as i told you before was but little
and she stood at the right end of the altar in the dark corner
at the last the communication of the first sexton had so discouraged me
that i durst not once look up with mine eyes
this pilgrimage came but to small effect
yes
it had a very good and merry end
you have caused me to take heart of grass
for as homer saith my heart was almost in my hose
when dinner was done
we returned to the temple
durfte you god and be suspect of felony
peradventure so
but i had not my self in suspicion
a guiltless mind putteth away fear
i was very desirous to see that table which the holy sexton did open to us
at the last we found it
but it was hanged so high that very few could read it
my eyes be of that fashion
that i can neither be called lynceus is abeaste so quick eyed that it will see thorough any wall lynceus
neither purr blind
and therefore i instantly desired alldryge to read it
whose reading i followed with mine own eyes
because i would scarcely trust him in such a matter
well
now all doubts be discussed
i was ashamed that i doubted so much
the matter was so plain set forth before our eyes
both the name
the peace
the thing it self as it was done
to be brief
there was nothing left out
there was a mane whose name was william which was borne in parise
a man very devout in many things
but principally exceeding religious in searching forth relics of all saints thorowowt all the world
he after that he had visited many places
countries
and regions
at the last came to constantinople
for wilhelm ’ s brother was there bishop
which did make him privy to a certain maid
which had professed chastity
that had part of our ladies milk
which were an exceeding precious relic
if that other with prayer
or money
or by any craft it might be got
for all the relics that he had got before were but trifles to so
william would not rest there till that he had got half of that holy milk
but when he had it
he thought that he was richer than croeseus
why not
but was it not without any good hope
he went than straightly home
but in his journey he fell seek
jesus there is nothing in this world that is other permanent
or always in good state
but when he saw and perceived that he was in great jeopardy of his life
he called to him a frenchman
which was a very trusty companion to him in his journey
and commanded all to avoid the place
and make silence
and privily did betake to him this milk
upon this condition
that if it chansed to come home safe and sound he should offer that precious treasure to our ladies altar in paris
which standeth in the mids of the river sequana
which doth appear to separate himself to honour and obey our blessed lady
but to make short tale
william is dead
and buried
the frenchman maid him ready to depart upon his journey
and suddenly fell seek also
and he in great despair of amending
did cometh the milk to an englishman
but not without great instance
and much prayer he did that which he was moved to do
than died he
and the other did take the milk
and put it upon an altar of the same place the chanones being present
which were it as we call regulares
they be yet in the abbey of saint genofeffe
but the englishman obtained the half of that milk
and carried it to walsyngan in england
the holy ghost put such in his mind
by my troth this is a godly tale
but lest there should be any doubt of this matter
the bishops which did grant pardon to it th air names be written there
as they came to visit it
not without the air offerings
and they have given to it remission
as much as they had to give by the air authority
how much is that
forty days
ye is there days in hell
truly there is time
ye but when they have granted all the air stint
they have no more to grant
that is not so for when one part is gone another doth increase
for that although it be incontinently filled
yet it is always empty
and if thou be taking out of it
yet there is never the less in the barrel
if they grant to an hundred thousand men forty days of pardon
should every man have alike
no doubt of that
and if any have forty before dinner
may he axe other forty at after
is there any thing lest than to give him
and if thou ask it ten-times in one hour
i would to god that i had such a pardon bag
i would ask but three groats
and if they would flow so fast
ye but you desire to be to rich
if that you might for wishing
but i will turn to my tale
but there was some good holy man which did give this argument of holiness to that milk
and said that our ladies milk which is in many other places
is precious and to be worshipped
but this is much more precious
and to be honoured
because the other was shaven of stones
but this is the same that came out of the virgins breast
how know you that
the maid of constantinople
which did give it
did say so
peradventure saint barnard did give it to her
so i suppose
for when he was an old man
yet he was so happy that he sucked of the same milk
that jesus himself sucked upon
but i marvel why he was rather called a honey sucker than a milk sucker
but how is it called our ladies milk that came never out of her breast
yes it came out at her breast
but peradventure it light upon the stone that he which sucked kneeled upon
and there was received
and so is increased
and by the will of god is so multiplied
it is well said
when we had seen all this
while that we were walking up and down
if that any thing of valour were offered
so that any body were present to see them the sextens maid great haste for fear of crafty conveyance
looking upon them as they would eat them
they point at him with there finger
they run
they go
they come
as though they would speak to them that stand by if they durst have be bold
were you afraid of nothing there
a learned astronomical discourse of the judgement of nativities
divided into three books and dedicated first to katherine the french queen
her physician
translated by gentleman
published by authority
he counteth the number of the stars &amp; calleth them all by their names
at london
printed at the widow charlewood &apos;s house for richard watkins
anno 1593
to the right honourable virtuous and learned lord henry
earl of northumberland
lord of the honours of cockermouth and petworth etc
knight of the most honourable order of the garter
all true felicity both in this life and in the world to come most heartily wished
if that saying of plato
right noble lord
be true
that our country challengeth an especial interest in our very uttermost ability
which any way may tend to profit &amp; benefit the same
then will it sufficiently countenance the poor received talon of mine
in that being so strictly charged by so great and grave a philosopher
i ought not to bury in oblivion my knowledge whatsoever
but rather as freely bestow mine endeavour on her
as she did frankly impart the light thereof to me
for though it be a common phrase in the mouths of men altogether ignorant in the precious value and profit of sciences
that the study of letters is a bottomless gulf
and so long and so uneasy a journey
that they which rashly think to finish it
oftentimes are drowned in the midway
and so under this pretence
account it better not to know much
yea
nothing at all
against such slothful suggesters of men in a deadly obscurity while they live
let me avouch that saying of aristotle
man
saith he
was created to understand and to do
for knowledge begetteth judgement
and by judgement men execute all good and virtuous actions
o science
saith plato
how would men love thee
if they did but know thee
for even as health is the conservation of the body
so is knowledge the sure and only safe-guarder of the soul
and cicero being of the same opinion
saith
o knowledge
the guide of our life
the only cause of virtue
and enemy to vice
what is the life of man without thee
if then
right learned lord
such a main &amp; current stream of unconquerable reason
washeth to nothing the empty and confused wits
of such as are enemies to the excellency of art
and maketh most fertile
like the overflowings of nilus
the judgements of them that are governed thereby
though far from me be the thought of arrogating the very lest title of art to my self
yet as one that desires to receive the breath of life from her sacred dwelling
and holds with the learned in all ages
that man is as a bruit beast without her
then let me thus far presume under your noble favour
to show that i have not altogether truanted in my life time
but how i have bestowed those permitted hours of exercise
that more weighty affairs in the world afforded me
both to declare my reverend zeal to so high a mystery
and unfeigned affection
i bear to your honour
the work was first written in french
by an excellent scholar
oger ferrier
a physician
borne in tolouze
&amp; dedicated to queen katherine of france
mother to the king that last deceased
and being now by me changed into an english habit
that it might receive no indignity by dedication
i have stamped your noble name in the forehead thereof
that it may be said
in despite of the proudest carper or controller
this is the god-child of a peerless godfather
and as i doubt not of your honourable acceptance
so i am likewise persuaded
that what hath wanted on my behalf in translation
or any other imperfection beside
shall be as nobly censured
in which resolution i humbly kiss your hand
and continue as forward in affection
as any to your honour &apos;s welfare
thomas kelway
one of her highness trumpets in ordinary
to the courteus reader
i am to request
gentle reader
one favour at thy hand
that if this work of the judgement of nativities seem harsh and unpleasant to thee
thou wouldst not therefore wound the same with injurious words
to charge thy self with more folly than needs
but if thou find it above thy knowledge or capacity
say as honest minded chion said
let my betters judge of these matters
for i must and do confess
that it is not a book for every man &apos;s reading
and he that reads with derision
because he understands not
must blame his own insufficiency
and not the book
for if he could learn as much in an hour
as cost a learned man many years to compass
than would his humour be pleased
and the work not reproached
but let such loiterers understand
that knowledge requires the whole circuit of a man &apos;s life
and live he never so long
yet may he learn
but if it might be attained in a summers day
a number would be excellent
that through default thereof remaineth utterly ignorant
to use many words
i account needless
knowing that the reproof of the unlearned
is rather the badge of their own weak brain
than any blemish to a work of worth
therefore let them censure as they please
the learned
i know
will judge like themselves
of whom i had rather be deservedly controlled
then by the other be ignorantly commended
thomas kelway
the table of the matters in this present treatise
the first book
of the celestial figure of a nativity
this done
search in the ephemerideses in the table of the year of your nativity
in the right month &amp; day proposed
the degree of the sign wherein the sun is
look afterward in the table of houses
which serve for the latitude of your country
and search there the said degree of the sun under the line of the tenth house
and having found in the same place the same degree of the sun
you shall find directly upon the left hand of the same table
a number of hours and minutes
the which writ apart
to which number
you must add the hours and minutes that hath been given you of the same nativity
and that which resteth by your addition
you must seek in the table of houses
and there where you find the same number of hours &amp; minutes coming of the same addition
you must take to a right line the points and beginnings of the six houses
which you shall find marked
the which you shall direct upon your figure
beginning at the point of the tenth
and continuing towards the left hand
the beginning of the other six houses
you must take the opposite signs
and if it happen that the number of houses and minutes
come to more than twenty-four hours
it is then convenient to subtract twenty-four hours of the same time
and the residue seek out as we have aforesaid
if the hour of the same nativity
be upon the point of twelve hours of noon
you must take the houses in a right line of the degree of the sun
in the table of your latitude
without making any other addition
or subtraction
and that when in the figure estimative
within the which
it is needful by all means to apply the moving of the moon exactly calculated
according to the vulgar cannons of the ephemerideses
for to verify afterward your nativity by the hour of the conception
as followeth
chap ii
of the verification of the bower of the nativity
leaving the animodar of ptolemy and the meetings of schoner
and all other uncertain ways
although they have their authors
to verify the hours of nativities
i will presently follow the method of hermes
approved by long experience
and confirmed by ptolemy in his centiloque
and by abraham auenesrus
by alphonce leopolde
haly , and other most expert astrologians
hermes saith
that the ascendant of a nativity
hath been the place of the moon at the time of the conception
and that the ascendant of the conception
is the place of the moon at the hour of the nativity
who would be more near certified of the hour &amp; minute of a nativity
and of the true ascendant
it is convenient that you follow the doctrine of hermes by the method following
first of all that you look into the figure estimative
whether the moon be above the horizon or beneath
if she be above the horizon
count the distance that is between the point of the seventh house and the moon
if she be beneath the horizon
count the distance which is from the first house unto the moon
which distance of signs and degrees
you must search in the table that followeth
under the title of the moon
above the horizon or beneath
as truly you have found in the said figure
in a right line of the said distance
you shall find the time that the infant hath remained within the womb of his mother
in a certain number of days
the which you must reckon from the day of your nativity backward
and there where the number endeth
you must mark the day of the conception
if the moon be found in the sign of the ascendant estimative
if you find her not in the same place
go backward or forward certain days of your account
until you have found the moon within the said sign
not far from the degree ascendant in the said figure
the day considered
and in what hour
go forward to the east point
the place where you have sound the moon in the figure estimative
and at that hour you must calculate the moving of the moon
for this degree and minute in the which you found her
you must place it in the ascendant of your nativity
and to know the hour in the which the place of the moon of the nativity
rose to the east point at the time of the conception
take first the overthwart ascension of the said place of the moon
within the table of the directions of your country
in the book of john de regiomonte
of the same ascension take away 90
degrees
&amp; ad to the whole circle which is of 360
degrees
when the subtraction cannot be otherwise made
the residue shall be the right ascension of the height of the point of the meridian circle
take afterward the right ascension of the sun
and take out by the subtraction of the right ascension of the said point of the meridian
and add 360 degrees if it be necessary
&amp; turn that which is left into hours and minutes
in giving to 30 degrees two hours
to fifteen degrees one hour
to one degree 4 minutes of an hour
to fifteen minutes one minute of an hour
by this means you shall exactly come to the hour of the conception
to the which you must calculate the place of the moon
and the same well calculated
put it to the point of the first house
in the figure of the nativity
divers for this verification do dress and garnish the motions of the planets four figures
one of that hour estimative of the nativity
the other of the precedent conjunction or opposition of the brightness
the third of the verification by the animodar
the fourth of the conception
the which besides the unprofitable and superfluous labour
err greatly
thinking to find out the time of the conception by the animodar of ptolemy
the which experience from day to day showeth to be false
and that it hath no ancient author to maintain it
or hath made mention of this new doctrine
being full of contention and disproved verity
the table of the time that the child doth remain within the womb of his mother
the moon being under the horizon
reckon from the ascendant
the moon being above the horizon
reckon from the seventh
chap iii
the manner to set down perfectly the said figure verified
having put to the point of the first house
the degree &amp; minutes of the moon of the time of the conception
take the overthwart ascensions of the said degrees and minutes
take out afterward 90 degrees of the said ascensions
and add thereto 360 degrees
if otherwise the subtraction cannot be made
that which remaineth
shall be the right ascensions of the highest point of the circle meridian
the which search in the table of the right ascensions
in the book of alphonce
or of john de regiomonte
etc
and put to the point of the tenth house
the degrees &amp; minutes of the sign you find
answering to the right number of the said right ascensions
the point of the fourth is always against the sign and degree of the tenth
likewise the point of the seventh
to the point of the first
the other houses sufficed
take the ephemerideses
because they do not desire exact calculation
seeing that the most part of the astrologians
desire more to take of the equal portion of the eclipse then of the horizontal sect
for to know the exact hour of the said figure
verify first the said right ascensions of the meridian
and take from them the right ascensions of the sun
that which remaineth turn into hours and minutes
giving to xv degrees one hour
to every degree four minutes of an hour
etc
as we have said before
at this hour you must newly count the moving of the moon
and of the sun &amp; of the other planets
and upon this figure you must ground the parts and judgements astronomical
chap
of the parts of nativities
after you have well sought the planets in the said figure verified
you must consider their above certain proportions of the planets and parts of the heaven
taken of their distances
as followeth
the parts concerning the significations of the first house
the part of the quality of the life
is taken by the distance of jupiter from saturn
counting as much space from the ascendant
as when the nativity is by day
for when it is by night
they take it to the contrary
the distance of saturn unto jupiter
following the natural order of the signs
counting likewise as much space since the ascendant
the part of life by day and by night
is taken of the degree of the precedent conjunction
or opposition of the lights unto the moon
counting from the ascendant
the part of the spirit
many do call the part of earthly things and secrets
the other
the part of things to come
the others
the part of the sun

by the day
is from mercury unto mars
from the ascendant
at night to the contrary

take jupiter in his place
of the fourth
the part of father
by the day
is from the sun unto saturn

from the moon unto the degree of the eight house
taken upon the equality of the eclipse accounting from the place of saturn
the part of the mortal planet by day is from the lord of the ascendant
unto the moon

the part of the perilous year of death
or poverty
or of any other misfortune by day
and by night

is from the lord of the ninth unto the ninth
taken upon the equality of the eclipse
from the ascendant
the part of travail by water by day
is from saturn unto the fifteenth degree of cancer

at night to the contrary
if saturn do meet in the said fifteenth degree of cancer
he shall be signifier of this part
with the ascendant
of the tenth
the part of nobility by day
is from the sun unto the nineteenth degree of aries
accounting from the ascendant
by night
from the moon unto the third degree of taurus
if the moon by night be in the said degree of taurus
or the sun by day
in the said degree of aries
they shall be signifiers of the said part
the part of government by day
is from mars unto the moon from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
the part of magistrates
as the part of the understanding
written upon the first house
the part of conquest &amp; victory

the part of sudden advancement
by day
is from saturn unto the part of fortune
from the ascendant

is from the part of the spirit
unto the part of fortune
chap
of the latitudes and aspects of the planets
having applied the planets in the said figure
and ordained as we have said in the former chapter
the parts proceeding of the proportions of the said planets
you must consequently draw out of the ephemerideses their latitudes
&amp; put apart all the aspects which is among them
and towards the said parts and xii houses
also the radiations
after the last proposition of the book of directions of john de regiomonte
upon the which note
that the aspects opposites
have always divers latitudes to them of their planets
although they keep the same number
as if saturn had two degrees of latitude septentrional
his opposition hath two degrees of latitudes meridional
the quadrant aspect hath no latitude
for it falleth always upon the eclipse
the trine aspect
retaineth the half of the number of the latitude
in contrary part
for if a planet have one degree of latitude meridional
his trine shall have thirty minutes of latitude septentrional
the sextile retaineth the same side
with the half of the number
you must also note
that these aspects of saturn and of jupiter
do not extend but unto nine degrees
or for the most longest unto twelve
those of mars unto eight
or for the most part to ten
the sun extendeth his beams to xv degrees
venus and mercury almost to eight
the moon unto twelve
the head &amp; tail of the dragon
likewise extend their forces unto twelve degrees
moreover , it is to be noted
that the opposition is a plain aspect and perfect enmity
the quadrate of less enmity
the trine of perfect love
the sextile of imperfect love
that which always receiveth exception in jupiter and venus
of the which opposites and quadrate aspects
profit the sun &amp; the moon with reception
or without reception
and to others also with reception
chap vi
of the fortunes and infortunes of the planets
and parts of heaven
after this
you must consider the forces &amp; weakness of the planets
parts and houses
and conferring the ones significations with the other
you must collect the fortunes and infortunes of every place
as followeth
hear followeth the infortunes
the planets and other places of the heaven
be called unfortunate
when they be burned under the beams of the sun
burnings are called saturn and jupiter
when between them &amp; the sun they have less than twelve degrees
mars when he is burned of the sun
hath at the least xj degrees and a half
venus and mercury
when they be near the sun
xj degrees
the moon when she is not burned
by xiii
and yet you find other terms
when you will take a planet for to give the years
then the three superiors are esteemed burnt
because they are near the sun by xv degrees
and if they be occidental
for when they be oriental unto ten degrees
they are burnt from the ten unto xv
under the beams
venus and mercury occidental near to the sun by seven degrees
or oriental by five
be burned
from thence unto twelve under the beams
the moon near by twelve degrees is burnt
from thence unto xv
under the beams
and you must note
that the said accidents are not hurtful when they fall in the signs of aries
and of the lyon
unfortunate also are the planets
when they go backward
and when they be joined with saturn or with mars
or when they receive evil aspects of them
when they are joined with any fixed star of violent nature
when they are in their detriments or fallings
that is to say
in places opposite to their houses or exaltations
when they are in their declining houses
when they are first standers
that is to say
when they be in the degree and minute wherein incontinently they begin to go backward
when they are in the way of burning
which begin at the 19 degree of libra
and end in the third degree of scorpio
when they be with the tail of the dragon
when they are joined with a backward planet
or otherwise unfortunate
when they are peregrine &apos;s
without being received
they are called peregrins
when they have no dignity or place where they be
of the reception we will speak afterwards
when they be meridional descendants
when any of the three superiors are occidental
or venus &amp; mercury oriental
when they be in evil aspects of the sun
when they do not regard any other planet
when they be opposites to the lord of the sign where they be
when they be set
that is to say
between two evil planets
although they have 30 degrees of distance
when they be in evil houses or terms
when they be in the twelfth sign of their principal houses
when they be under the horizon in the day
or above the horizon in the night
if they be diurnes
as saturn
jupiter
and the sun
when they be above the horizon in the day
and beneath at night
if they be nocturnes
as mars
venus
mercury
and the moon
when they be in signs and degrees feminine
they be masculines
or in signs and degrees masculine
they be feminines
feminines are venus and the moon
mercury and androgine
the others are masculines
when they be in degrees which are called azemenae
or in degrees stinking
dark
or smoky
that which is marked in the ephemerideses
in the table of the dignities of the planets
infortune &apos;s particular to the moon
when she decreaseth
when she is within the eight house
out of her principal dignities
when she is within the seventh
and that as to the life
and as for any other significations she is not infortunate in the seventh
when she is in the nineteen
degree of a sign
when she is slack in her course
that is to understand
when she goes in twenty-four hours
less than thirteen degrees and xi minutes
the fortunes of the planets
fortunate be the planets
and other places of heaven
when they be in angles
or at the least in houses succeeding
when they be in a good aspect of jupiter
or of venus
or at the least in evil
with reception
when they be joined to the sun within sixteen minutes
when they be in a good aspect of the sun
of the moon
or of mercury fortunate
when they be joined with any fixed star of a loving nature
when they be directs
or at the least
in the second station
that is to understand
when they be in degree and minute
in the which beginneth incontinently the direction
when they be within their proper houses or exaltations
when they be in their triplicities and terms together
or triplicity and face together
when they be in houses
wherein they naturally take pleasure
as mercury in the ascendant
the moon in the third
venus in the fifth
mars in the sixth
the sun in the ninth
jupiter in the eleventh
and saturn in the twelfth
when they be in any of their dignities
or if they be peregrines
when they be received
received
that is
the planets
which receive aspect of him
which in their place hath at the least four dignities
the which reception is fortunate
when she is made of a good aspect
at all times the receptions of jupiter and venus be always favourable
although they be not made of good aspects
when they mount to the highest part of their circles
when they be septentrionals
principally ascendants
when any of the three superiors is oriental
or venus and mercury occidental
when they begin to go from the beams of the sun
when they be in houses or terms of favourable planets
when they be above the horizon in the day
or under the horizon in the night
if they be diurnes
when they be under the horizon in the day
or above the horizon in the night
if they be nocturnes
when they are in signs and degrees masculine
they be masculine
or in signs and degrees feminines
they be feminines
when they be in degrees fortunate &amp; clear degrees
which are called lucides
particular fortunes of the moon
when she increaseth
when she is within the house or exaltation of the sun
when she is very swift in her course
that is to understand
when she goes more than thirteen degrees &amp; 11 minutes in 24 hours
chap vii
if the child shall live or no
all this above considered
you must first look
whether he that is borne
is for life in this world or no
that which principally will show us the light of the time
that is to say
the sun by day
and the moon by night
are the lords of the triplicity of him
and the ascendant with his dominator
when the dominator of the ascendant
shall be unfortunate by the lord of the eight house
the child cannot live
and less
if the lords of the triplicity of the temporal light be unfortunate
when within the first house shall be any fixed star of violent nature
or any ill fortune
that is to say
saturn or mars
without having at the least four dignities
and the temporal light shall be unfortunate
the child shall die quickly
if you find not any fixed star of amiable nature
or if jupiter and venus
or the sun or the moon
do not communicate unto him their beams
for and if the aspect be of love
or of enmity with reception
the child shall live
if the dominator of the ascendant be burnt
the child shall die before 9 days be accomplished
and more sooner if he be burned within the eight house
or in this estate
if he be joined with the lord of the eight
except when he is burned in his own house or exaltation
or within the house or exaltation of the sun
when the moon
being the temporal light
shall be unfortunate within the first house
without any aspect of the fortunes
&amp; without the conjunction of any fixed stars of amiable nature
the hope of life shall not be great
when the moon shall be unfortunate within the fourth house
and he that hath the misfortune shall be also unfortunate
&amp; out of his principal dignities
the infant cannot live
&amp; the mother shall be in great danger of death at her deliverance
and principally if the ascendant be the house or exaltation of the moon
when the infortunes are conjoined within the eighth house
it signifieth very short life
except when mars and saturn be in capricorn
many joint planets within the first house
bring not good testimony of life
although they be all fortunate
when the dominator of the ascendant
and the temporal light
and the lords of their triplicities be not altogether unfortunate
the child may easily live
chap viii
of the giver of life
named of the arabians hyleg
the giver of life is taken out of the principal places of the figure
that is to say
of the sun
of the moon
and of the ascendant
of the part of fortune
&amp; of the degree of the last conjunction or opposition of lights
the which having well noted
we consider first
if the nativity be diurnal or nocturnal
for if she be diurne we begin at the sun
the which within the first
tenth
or eleventh house
in a masculine or feminine sign
shall be fit to give life
if it have any giver of time that doth regard it
if it be in the ninth
eight
or seventh house
it may also be the giver of life
if it be in a masculine sign
and not in a feminine
in other places it cannot be the giver of life
but by constraint
it is always necessary for such an act
that the giver of time regard the giver of life
otherwise
the said giver of life shall be as person that hath good will to do his friend good &amp; hath not wherewithal
and so when the sun shall be without aspect of any giver of time
you must leave it there
&amp; go to the moon
which may give the life within the first house
in the sign masculine or feminine
and within the tenth
eleventh
seventh
fourth
fifth
second and third house
in signs feminines and not masculines
receiving aspect of any giver of time
if the moon have not all the said conditions
you must come to the degree ascendant
if the nativity be conjunctional
conjunctional is said the nativity
before the which lastly the lights have been conjoined
and if the said degree receive aspect of his giver of time
he shall be giver of life
otherwise not
wherefore you must examine the part of fortune
the which shall give life in the angles and houses succeeding
with the aspect of the giver of time
otherwise you must come to the degree
to the which lastly the lights have been conjoined
the which within the angles or houses succeeding shall be giver of life
if he receive aspect of his giver of time
it is here necessary that the giver of time have dignity of house
or of exaltation in places of the part of fortune
and of the said degree conjunctional
by this order you must seek the giver of life
when the nativity is conjunctional
when she is preventional
preventional is said
afore the which lastly the lights have been opposites
after you have considered the sun and the moon
you must consequently contemplate the place of fortune
more than the degree ascendant
and lastly the degree of the oppositions of the lights
&amp; see that it have 2
degrees in the opposition
one of them of the sun
and the other of the moon
the astrologians command to consider it
that at the time of the opposition it hath been in the first house
or elsewhere above the horizon
when the nativity is nocturnial
we follow the same order
except that first we consider the moon
secondly the sun
etc
this giver of life
when either by direction
or by profection
or by other way
meet any evil aspect of the infortunes
or of the stars fixed of violent nature
or any of the notable conjunctions
or eclipses of the lights
it causeth then some sickness
and very suddenly bringeth death
when the fortunes do not intermingle the favourable beams
chap
ix
of the giver of years
called of the arabians alcocoden
the giver of time or giver of years
is the same that hath dignity of house
exaltation
triplicity
or term in the place where is the giver of life
as if the sun were in the xj
in the sign of sagitarius
there where he may be giver of life
and jupiter were in the sign of aquarius
he shall regard the sun of the sextile aspect
and look that he have dignity of the house in the sign of the sun
he shall be giver of years
it is then necessary
that these two things concur together
to the end that one planet be giver of years
that is to say
that he hath dignity nevertheless of term
for the dignity of face is not sufficient enough for one so great effect
in sign and degree
in the which shall be the giver of life
and that he regard the said giver of life
of one aspect or other
this giver of time
well lodged upon the point of angles
giveth him old years
in points of the houses succeeding
is means
is cadents
is smallness
and for as much as he shall be long from the beginnings of the said houses
so much the more or less he must diminish the number of his old years
means
and smallness
after the difference taken of the next houses with the difference of years
and first of all if it be within any angle of heaven
not always to the first point
you must proceed also
and take in the first place the distance of the said angle
and of the next house succeeding
note afterward
how many degrees the said giver of years is from the point of the angle
then take the difference of his old years and means
multiply this difference by the number of the said elongment
and part it by the distance of the said angle
&amp; of the house succeeding
that which resteth
take for the exact number of the years of life
promised by the said giver of years
if he be within any house
succeeding out of the points and beginnings of the same
you must first take the distance of the house succeeding
and of the next cadent
then note how many degrees the said giver of years shall be elonged from the point of the said house succeeding
afterward take the difference of years
means and smallness
the which multiply by the second number
and part it by the first
the residue shall be the time of life which was promised by the said giver of years
if it be in cadent house &apos;s it shall be upon the points of them
or after
he giveth but only small years
except when he is within 5
degrees near to the point of the said angles
&amp; then you must reckon as it followeth
take the difference of the old years
and smallness of the planets that giveth the years
and divide them into 5 parts
afterward look in which of the said 5 degrees shall be the said planet
for if it be in the first and most near the point of the angle
that is to say
if he be elonged from the said angle one degree only
then is it convenient to take out of his old years
one of the said 5 parts
if he be elonged by 2 degrees
you must take out 2 parts
if he be elonged 3 degrees
you must subtract 3 parts
etc
you must note that the moon in the viii
gives but small years
and that the sun within the 9 and jupiter in the 11
and venus in the 5
and mercury by the whole ascendant
and the moon in the 3
give their old years as perfectly
as if they were upon the points of the angles
for they be places wherein principally they do rejoice
jupiter
venus
and mercury within the 9 give their years indifferent
and the moon in the 11
gives them old
mars in the 6
and saturn in the 12
they are indifferent
because in the said places they greatly delight themselves
wherefore if they were not evil
they would there give old years
upon this propose it is convenient also to note
that one burnt planet cannot be a giver of years
and the moon in the prime of the beams of the sun
cannot give life nor time
if a planet
which otherwise may be a giver years
be burnt in his proper house or exaltation
receiving there the sun
causeth the sun to take the charge to be the giver of years
if it come to pass that the sun or the moon be in their proper houses or exaltations
they may be givers of life &amp; time together
with out need to desire aspect of any other planet
if one place being significator of life
have many givers of years
we will take him that hath most dignities in the same place
and if they be equal in dignities we will take him that hath his aspect most whole
and his beams most nearest the said giver of life
if they find two or three or many givers of life
that have their givers of years
they must always consider and direct
as the first and principal
following the years of the planets
old years
mean years
small years
of them that augment and diminish the number of the said years
they which augment the number of the said years
are jupiter
venus
the sun
the moon
&amp; mercury fortified
the which fortunately regarding the giver of years
with an amiable aspect adding to their small years
that is to understand
the sun x
and ix
venus viii
the moon xxv
etc
likewise if the giver of time be conjoined with any fixed star of amiable nature
it taketh of the said star the number of the small years of the planet
of the which the said star holdeth his nature
if the said planets regard the giver of time with an evil aspect with reception
they add as before
which they do not when they have no reception
except jupiter and venus
that in every sort of aspects
with reception or without reception
always adding to their small years
for to see that the giver of time be not saturn or mars
towards the which the reception is necessary
if the aspect be of enmity
the said planets evil placed and infortunate
in the place of the whole small years
in adding the half
or the third
or fourth part
or certain number of months
of weeks
or of days
according to the greatness or smallness of their infelicity
the amiable aspects of ill fortunes
with reception
give their years small
without reception
they do neither good nor evil
if the giver of years be retrograde or meridional descending
or in his fall or detriment
or in the way burned
that taketh from it the fifth part of that which he had given being otherwise disposed
that which happened also to the 3
superior planets
when they be occidental
&amp; to the moon when she decreaseth
and when she is in the xx and ix degree of a sign
and when she is slack in her course
the sun regarding the moon with the aspects of enmity without reception diminished
saturn
mars
or mercury deprived
looking to the evil aspect of the giver of light they take away the number of their small years
except they recover
for then by opposition they do but half the evil
by quadrate aspect
they diminish but the fourth part
the tail of the dragon taken from the moon xii
years
i have found it often by experience
that the fortunes
that is to understand
jupiter &amp; venus
or the sun and the moon
and mercury fortunate in the first house
or near to the giver of life
adding to their small years
although they do not regard the giver of time
and to the contrary
that the infortunes in the said places
take away the small years
without regarding the said giver of time
except when they were well honoured in the said places
or when they were lords of the nativities
chap xi
of the lords of the nativity
you must take the lord of the nativity
out of the places of the which we have taken the giver of life
that is to understand
of the place of the sun and of the moon
of the degree ascendant of the part of fortune
and of the degrees of the precedent conjunction or opposition of lights
of all these places likewise it is to be considered
what planet hath most dignities
for he shall be lord of the nativity
that which the giver of years shall signify the time of our life
according to the situation &amp; felicity or infelicity
as we have before said of the giver of years
and if the one give more than the other
you must take the difference of both
and the half ad or diminish
according as shall be necessary

chap xii
of the understanding and manners of a man
how to know the felicity or infelicity of the spirit
&amp; the nature of the same
you must look in the place of mercury and of the moon
the planet that in these two places hath most dignities
shall be signifier of the spirit
the which if it be saturn well disposed
shall signify the man of a great and profound knowledge
of good counsel
and of good gravity or a strong opinion
close
secret
solitary
dissembling his good and evil
a lover of just men
and of good age
rejoicing upon the treasures
heritage &apos;s and labourings
holding discourse of antiquities and of great affairs
admirator of buildings
sometimes a little merry
incontinent sad
sometimes laughing or murmuring by himself alone
a little slothful
a little envious

he shall be noted envious

a blasphemer
a liar &amp; deceiver
a usurer

fearing that all the world doth deceive him
uncivil
a villain
a slovine
dishonest
flying the company of men unless it be to deceive them
and to draw any profit
having no other friend but his villainous gain
using sometimes sorcery
jupiter signifier of the spirit
well disposed
shows the man sweet
courteous
honest
gracious
amiable
faithful
pitiful
liberal
of good behaviour
of good heart &amp; good love
following nobleness and all honesty
loving god
abounding in friends
dreaming always upon some virtuous thing
and withdraws himself sometimes solitary
to think upon some goodness
using in all and by all his affairs
a great equity
prudence and modesty
having great courage to accomplish
if he be unfortunate of himself
and not to meet with other stars
in the place of good love
he will give sometimes foolishness in the place of honesty
pride in the place of liberality
prodigality in the place of loving good will
doth yield him an hypocrite
seeming to follow nobleness
when indeed he will dispraise all the world
in the place of honesty
it will make him dream of tyranny
if the said jupiter be unfortunate of other planets and not of himself
he taketh all their vices
and covereth them with his said virtues in manner of an evil hypocrite
if mars well fortunate be the said significator
he shall cause the man to be of a high courage
hardy
ireful
furious
a hazarder
a conductor of wars
&amp; the first in business
and only in deeds and cogitations given to arms
strong
stubborn and mighty
trusting too much to his own puissance
not fearing any peril
and blessed in all his deeds
if he be unfortunate
it maketh the man timorous
a thief
a liar
blasphemer
mutinous
cruel
a murderer
hardy
proud
arrogant
not to be borne withal
despising his own proper goods
and the goods of other
using force and violence against his parents
and against all the world
a devilish man
without shame
without counsel
without virtue
without love
without any fear or reverence of god
furious
seditious
given and prompt to all mischief
if the sun be significator in his good disposition
it makes the man mannerly
wise
prudent
of good counsel
a lover of nobleness
following glory and honour
given to justice and governments of towns and cities
loving hunting
worthy
and of great estimation
if it be unfortunate
it showeth great pride
excessive ambition
and tyranny
and doth nourish the thought
if venus signify the quality of the spirit in good disposition
it maketh the man pleasant
merry
dancing
laughing
content
amiable
gracious
of good conversation
and a little jealous
if unfortunate
it maketh the man frowning
and too merry
of evil maintenance
using dishonest words
given to voluptuousness
and jealous of that which belongeth not unto him
if mercury be fortunate
it gives good understanding
good memory
great perseverance
great subtlety of spirit
good discourse of reason
full of wit
very apt to know the mathematicals
and the secrets of nature
it makes the man a poet
an orator
well spoken
writing well
and a great trader
if it be evil disposed
it makes him presumptuous
of little knowledge
with great estimation of his person
inconstant
a liar
a mocker
a deceiver ordinarily
fine
fantastical
and vicious
if it be the moon that is fortunate
she maketh him that is borne
pacified
modest
of good heart
or good will
and easy to endure any thing that one will do
unfortunate doth show inconstancy
lightness of spirit
faint-hearted
prodigal
faithless
if the said signifiers
are not greatly fortunate or unfortunate
it is convenient to rebate the said significations good and vicious
after the quality of their good and evil dispositions
if any planet be participant in the signification of the manners
or if it have great communication of aspect with the principal significator
then considering the vices and virtues of him
that according to his good or evil disposition
we do join them to him which giveth the principal
as if saturn well disposed
be principal significator
and mars infortunate be participant
or regard saturn of one whole aspect with reception
than it is convenient to mingle some little of the nature of mars unfortunate
with the significations of saturn fortunate
the astrologians do advertise us
that if the lord of the ascendant be well placed
and the said significator of manners evil disposed
you must more consider upon that which the lord of the ascendant signifieth
then upon that which the said significator doth promise
moreover
they consider more particularly
the place of mercury and of the moon
and the aspect which they receive
if mercury be in the ascendant
it maketh the man ingenious
and of great and profound knowledge
a great philosopher
a mathematician
an orator
a poet
a divine
principally when he is in the place in the which saturn hath at the least 4
dignities
or when he receives aspect of saturn
mercury in the twelfth
receiving aspect of the moon
hath very near as great force for to give wit and knowledge
as if he were in the first
and where that mercury is
if he regard the moon
and both two
or the one or the other
regard the ascendant or the lord of the ascendant
this is sign of a good and subtle spirit
and if saturn
jupiter and mars
or other planets
do communicate to him their favourable beams
if they mingle their good virtues
if they regard the evil aspect
they intermingle their vices
except jupiter and venus
which of evil aspect do never annoy them
and less when he hath reception
if the sun be temporal light
it may signify the quality of the spirit with the moon and mercury in the form above said
if mercury be occidental within the house or exaltation of the sun
having aspect of the moon
or of the ascendant
or of his lord
it is the sovereign sign of good and high spirits
of men of all knowledge
given to great enterprises and virtues
as poets
orators
mathematicians
counsellors
administrators of commonweals
and governors of realms
principally when he is fortunate in every angle of heaven
mercury within the seventh house fortunate
giveth good understanding
and ripe judgement
it maketh the man subtle
watchful
and of good counsel
with great craft to govern his affairs
mercury in the ninth or third house
giveth knowledge and contemplation
the part of the understanding of the spirit with their lords fortunate
signifieth good spirits and good manners
mercury in the sign of pisces
doth not any way love learning
the contrary happeneth
when he is in the sign of virgo and of gemini
by all the places of the figure of heaven
saturn within the houses of mercury
is always contemplative
mars
a little deceiver
mercury within the houses of saturn fortunate
is always studious
within those of mars
he is full of evil words
and often false
when the lights and significators of manners shall be oppressed with ill fortune
the child shall be of a very strange and perverse nature
the moon opposite to the sun
makes him hate all men
if the sun and the moon with the ascendant and his lord
be all in feminine signs
the manners of him shall be feminine
and he shall be a man of little heart
if they be in signs masculine at the nativity of a woman
her deeds shall be manly
and she shall be a woman of great enterprise
if venus be in the sign of the lion
or under the beams of the sun
or in conjunction or other aspect of mars
she maketh that the man shall be suddenly stricken in love
and if in that estate she be within the first or tenth house
without any aspect of jupiter
he shall be voluptuous without having shame
and when she shall be in the sign of scorpio
the aspect of jupiter towards venus
giveth always chastity
and love of virtue
chap xiii
of riches and poverty
for the riches and poverty
it is convenient first that you look to the second house
for if she and her lord be fortunate
we say that the child shall be rich
and if they be unfortunate
he shall be poor on that side
then afterward you must consider the part of fortune
the which with his lord well disposed
promiseth great store of goods
without other witness
if they be evil disposed
you must come to the part of goods the which with his lord fortunate enricheth
unfortunate giveth nothing
likewise you must judge of the part of felicity and of his lord
and that thing which the other places signify
you must always have recourse to the natural significator of riches
which is jupiter
the which well placed and fortunate
giveth goods in abundance
principally if he be lord of the nativity
or lord of the hour
or of the ascendant
or of the second house
or of the part of fortune
or of the part of goods
or of the part of felicity
or of temporal light
or of the tenth house
otherwise he giveth nothing
when the abovesaid significators shall be unfortunate
the child cannot be rich
if the tenth house
of the which we will speak hereafter
do not promise him some good luck
men find also often by experience
that when a planet is within his own house or exaltation
or in his joy
without being unfortunate
or else where environed with the fortunes or their beams
that he giveth goods
although he be not significator of riches
if in the fourth house be his lord or other fortunate planet
he promiseth inheritances
if any fixed star of the first or second greatness be joined to the temporal light
or to the degree ascendant
or to the points of the other angles
or to other planets in the said places placed
she doth raise the man of base estate
to great authority and honour
and if he be of the race of princes
it will make him a puissant lord and king
when a like planet shall be lord of the ascendant
&amp; of the second house
the child shall be covetous of money &amp; gain
as that which happeneth when capricorn is ascendant
when the lord of the second house shall be within the first
the goods come without labour
likewise when the lord of the second house giveth strength to the lord of the ascendant
when the lord of the ascendant shall be in the second
the goods shall not come without travail
nor when the lord of the ascendant shall give strength to the lord of the second
saturn
mars
mercury depraved
the sun and the tail of the dragon lunary
within the second
destroy the man
and disperse his goods
except when they have at the least four dignities
or when they be received
when the lord of the ascendant shall regard with evil aspect the second house
or the part of goods and of fortune
or their lords
the child of his own proper will shall disperse his goods
if the lord of the ascendant be unfortunate in the second house
the child shall be too large a giver
and prodigal
if any misfortune have domination upon the ascendant
and in the second
the child shall be destroyed by others
which shall destroy his goods and rob him
when the said significators of goods shall be unfortunate
the child shall be all his life in pain and travail
without any advancement or profit
abraham auenesre saith
that if the lord of the second be burnt
and jupiter evil disposed
that the child shall be four planets in their falls or detriments
do show great miseries
as it was in the nativity of john duke of saxony
who was taken prisoner of charles the 5
this good duke had 3
planets in their detriments
and one perigren
always poor
and hermes saith
when the lord of the profession
of the which we shall speak in the 27
chap
shall be burnt
or retrograde
or in the sixth or xii house
and not any planet regarding the moon
the child shall seek his living from door to door like a beggar
jupiter
venus
and the head of the dragon in the second
always enrich
venus in the fifth promiseth some good
the sun in the ninth fortunate
giveth benefices
or other goods of the side of the men of the church
mars in the sixth well disposed
giveth good or nourishment to beasts
and exercise of physic
the sun in the sign of leo
will never suffer the child to be poor
chap xiiii
by what means riches and poverty cometh
having well noted the places which promise and bring riches
in regarding the situation of the said significators
we will know by what means ought to come the good and the evil
for if the significator be in the first house received and fortunate
it easily enricheth the person by his industry and proper labour
and if he be in the said place unfortunate
it is that his industry and labour doth profit him nothing
and the sooner from thence to loss and damage
if he be in the second house well disposed
it profiteth to talk with merchants
and lend merchandise &amp; money
and of them make gain
and if he be there evil disposed
the said business bringeth great damages
if he be within the third house fortunate
it bringeth the goods from the side of brothers and sisters
and cousins &amp; alies
or from the side of the men of the church in taking charge of their affairs
or to traffic here and there about his country
if he be in the 4
well placed
he is enriched of inheritances &amp; goods of our fathers &amp; predecessors
of labouring &amp; tilling of ground
of houses
&amp; oftentimes doth meet with treasure
if it be within the fifth
it profits to be a good dancer
a good player
to be brave
gracious
pleasant and delightful
and sometimes to be voluptuous
always well
because of godfathers and godmothers
and of their proper children
or because of gifts
or to make some voyage and do some embassage
those things that come appertaining to bravery and voluptuous
and making ready delicates
odours &amp; perfumes
of this house they very suddenly draw their profit
if the said significator be in the sixth well placed
he shall make his profit in nourishing
and buying and selling of sheep
muttons
and other small beasts
or shall become rich by the diligence and faithfulness of his servants
or shall gain by the exercise of physic
the gaylors and others which have the charge of prisons
draw oftentimes their profit from this house
if the significator be in the seventh fortunate
it promiseth great good of the side of women
by marriages or like agreements
and oftentimes to have pleaded &amp; gained his suit in the law
or having been in the wars and peeled the enemies
if it be in the eight well disposed
it giveth great dowry and great good
because of women
and sometimes heritage &apos;s
of the which he shall not greatly think of
if it be in the ninth fortunate
he shall be enriched of the goods of the church
or by traffic &amp; traveling in strange countries
if it be well in the tenth
he shall have his profit of the side of kings
princes
and lords
and be made of them governors of towns
and honourable officers
or be enriched by their own vocation and profession
if it be within the eleventh in good disposition
he profiteth by reason of friends
and by favour of men in authority
if it be in the twelfth
fortunate
it giveth gain by nourishing and selling of horses
mares
oxen
cows
camels
and other great beasts
or to have charge of prisoners
or of the persecution of enemies
with profitable victory in the end
as oftentimes it happeneth to some
which accusing others
and cannot prove the crimes intended be condemned to make a good amends to the party
after all which persecution
the party doth find himself content
saturn by himself
enricheth by heritage &apos;s &amp; labour &apos;s
nourishing of all cattle
and with trading with ancient men
or with countrymen
mariners
&amp; other wild men
in corn
wines
oils
fish
oade
rosen
alum
leather
tiles
stones
plaster
chalk
lime
and such merchandise
jupiter
by offices
benefices
and business of men of the church
and all gains that are made without deceit
except when he is infortunate
for then under the shadow of virtue
he doth his affairs craftily
mars
by wars
suits
or thefts
or by slaughter
and selling of cattle
or if it be in aspect of venus
by physic
the sun
by honourable offices
dignities &amp; lordships
by great credit
by charges to keep and gather the money of princes and commonweals
venus
by music
pleasure
grace and virtue
by bravery
by play
and sometimes by voluptuousness
and sometime to serve some great lady
mercury
to speak well and write well
and to be very skilful
to be a secretary
a register
a poet
an orator
and a good advocate
to be a geometrician
arithmetician
astrologian
and a good trader
the moon for voyages
navigation
wandering
and trading in far countries
to have the charged of small affairs of the common wealth
if the said significator be unfortunate in the same places
they bring damage and interests
and if they be within the houses of saturn
jupiter or other planets
we judge the profit &amp; interest after the nature of saturn
jupiter
and other planets which shall be lord of the same places
chap xv
of the time when the riches and damages shall come
the said riches shall come
when the significators of goods shall meet by direction
in body or in aspects of amity
as if venus in some nativity promise goods
they shall come when venus by direction shall touch the place of jupiter
or the degree of the second house
or the part of fortune
or their good aspects
likewise you must judge of damages in goods
for when a significator of damages and interests doth meet by direction a significator of goods
or his aspects of enmity
then certainly comes the loss and damage
as when saturn or mars meet jupiter in the part of fortune
the part of goods and other places which signify riches
the which also you must direct to the said ill fortunes
or to their evil aspect signifying always some loss
by the revolutions also you may know the time of good and evil fortune
for when jupiter in the nativity shall be in the sign libra well disposed
always and as many times
as you shall find him in the revolution in the sign
in the same fortune certainly he shall then bring the goods that he promised
at the hour of the nativity
to the contrary
if he be unfortunate by saturn or mars in the nativity
always and as many times as he shall be in the revolution over against the said unfortunators
than the said damage shall come in the sort and manner as was signified in the nativity
if the significator of goods be oriental
the goods come in youth
if it be occidental
in age
if it be in the first house he shall be rich in his first age
if it be between the first and the tenth
upon the time of twenty and seven years
if it be in the tenth
between thirty and five and thirty
if it be between the tenth and seventh
about forty and forty eight
if it be in the seventh he shall be rich in his old age
you must also look to the three lords of the triplicity
and to every significator of goods
for the first lord signifieth the first age
the second of the time of thirty or forty years
the third the last age
wherefore if the first lord of the triplicity of one significator of riches be fortunate
the said goods signified shall come at the first time
or if he be unfortunate
the damage than shall stick
by this means you may apply the other lords
to the ages following
and according to the good or evil disposition you must judge of the fortune of every one
chap xvi
of brethren
mar and saturn within the third house out of their principal dignities and not received
signifieth that the child shall have no brother nor sister
and if they be in their principal dignities
or if they be fortunately received
they may then give some brethren
but by reason of the which he shall always be in sorrow
strife
and contentions
the tail of the dragon or lunaris
maketh him see the death of his brethren
when she is in the third house
that doth the lord of the said house also
when he is in the tenth or eight
and when he is burned or otherwise evilly disposed
if in the ix
be any planet well dignified
and the lord of the third house be unfortunate
his brethren shall die before him
if he do not find in the same house some favourable planet
or if the lord of the said house be not amiably regarded of fortunes
jupiter
the sun
venus
the head of the dragon
the moon
and mercury
fortunate in the third house
do give many brethren
happy
pacified and fortunate
mars
regarding the said house
or his lord of evil aspect
signifieth strife and debate among the brethren
that which signifieth also the lord of the said house
in the seven
and xii
and mars opposite to the ascendant
or to the lord of the ascendant
and to the temporal light
and when a like planet is lord of the iij
and vij
or xii house
the part of the amity of brethren with his lord fortunate
signifieth concord
unfortunate
discord among brethren
the part of brethren
and the third house
with their lords in watery signs
denoteth many brethren and sisters
and if they be fortunate
they signify concord and good love together
unfortunate
denoteth the contrary
chap xvii
of the father and the mother
the lords of the fourth
and of the part of the father
burnt out of their proper houses and exaltations
signify that the father cannot long live
the ill fortunes within the 4
signify that the father shall die presently after
if within the said house they be not dignified
or if the fortunes do not interlace their favourable beams
likewise you must judge of the mother
when the said constellations shall be in the 10
the fortunes in the 4
signify long life to the father
and happy fortune
&amp; likewise of the mother
when they be within the x
the sun unfortunate within the iiij
or viii
house
testifieth that the father shall not live long
likewise you must judge of the mother when the moon shall be so disposed
if the lord of the 4
be in the 11
the child shall see the death of his father
if the lord of the x
be in the 5
he shall see the death of his mother
venus or the moon in the 4
unfortunate
giveth peril to the mother at her deliverance
the lord of the 4
in the 7 or 12 house
or in evil aspects of ill fortunes
signifieth strife and quarrels between the father and the son
likewise you must judge of the mother
when the lord of the 10
shall be in the same disposition
the part of the father fortunate
denoteth long and happy life to the father
unfortunate
he shall die very quickly
the part of the mother
signifieth as much of the mother
after her good or evil disposition
commonly the astrologians have regard to the sun and to saturn for the father
and to venus and the moon for the mother
if the nativity be by day
they take the sun for significator of the father
if it by be night they take saturn
if the sun be not in any angle of heaven
for if it be in the 1
or 4
they prefer him always to saturn
if the sun be in the 1
in the nativity of the 1 child
the figure of the nativity of the father and of the son shall be both one
the significator of the father
joined to the fortunes
or receiving their amiable aspects
denote good fortune and long life to the father
the contrary you must understand when they be unfortunate
if the lord of the ascendant
and the lord of the 4
do look with an evil aspect
the son and the father shall be in discord
principally if mars intermeddle with his pernicious beams
for the mother you must look principally to venus
if the nativity be by day
or to the moon if it be by night

when one self planet is lord of the first and fourth house
the child shall have inheritances which shall enrich him
if the said lord be fortunate
and if he sell and disperse them
he is unfortunate
the lord of the ascendant
or the moon within the fourth fortunate
and amiably by jupiter or venus regarded
denote that he shall find some great sum of money under the earth

she giveth great goods and lands

die
if the said lord be in the xii he shall see the death of his children

chap xxi
of diseases
you must first of all consider the places of saturn and of mars
and of the lord of the sixth house
and according to the sign in the which they be
you must judge the sickness to be in the place marked by the said sign
as if saturn were in the sign of libra
it denoteth that the sickness is in the reins of the nature of saturn
because that libra is the sign that hath government over the reins
as shall be declared in the second book
likewise you must judge of other significators
after the government of the sign in the which they be
the sickness and accidents coming by saturn
mars and other planets
shall be explained in the second book
mars in the ascendant
giveth always some notable hurt upon the face
or upon the head
and often near the eyes
when he is near the lights
saturn in the first house
yieldeth the man to be very sad
and melancholy
and vexeth the mind
causing horrible ill and fearful imaginations
the tail of the dragon in the first
darkeneth much the sight and often yields the men blind
when the luminaries or the fortunes
do not intermingle their favourable beams
saturn and mars in the tenth
signify sickness in the neck
in the seventh
in the buttocks
as fistuloes
emerods
ulcers
and hurts etc
in the sixth
diseases in the feet
in the twelfith
hurts and griefs in the legs
as i have often tried
saturn infortunate
signifieth diseases in the parts appertaining to saturn
jupiter and the other
signify as much when they be evil disposed
of the parts which belong to the planets we will speak of in the second book
they which have the luminaries
or any of the principal places in the figure unfortunate in the sign of scorpio
are subject to the french-pox
the ill fortunes in the sign of gemini
give always some great and violent blows upon the shoulders
legs &amp; arms
the moon unfortunate in the sign of aries
signifieth great pain in the head
saturn and mars joined to the luminaries
or to the lord of the ascendant
trouble the sight
and spoil the eyes with some blow
the sun in the nativities diurnes
signifieth the right eye
the moon the left
in the nocturnes
to the contrary
if the degrees of the first house
or the luminaries be joined with any troublesome star
the eyes shall be dark
and the sight troubled
likewise if they be in the signs which the astrologers call azemena and filthy dregs
etc
saturn in the sixth house burned in a marry sign
denoteth some form of leprosy
saturn in the ascendant
maketh some notable deformity in the face
when he is near the moon
the ill fortunes
and the moon and venus in marry signs
signify leprosy
ulcers &amp; cankers on the body
and villainous spots in the face
saturn in the ninth
and the moon in the eight unfortunate
denote trouble of mind and folly
venus joined to mercury unfortunate by saturn or mars
without aspect of jupiter or of the sun
signify notable grief in the parts of generation
if venus &amp; mercury be under the beams of the sun
they signify as much
saturn with the moon burned
causeth palsies and impostumes
mercury unfortunate
giveth always some impediment in the tongue
and so doth saturn also when he is unfortunate in the temporal lights
the sun unfortunate
denoteth weakness of the heart
principally when he is lord of the sixth house
or lord of the part of sicknesless
the ill fortunes with the tail of the dragon
cause looseness and the flux of the belly
they that have the sun or mars in the signs of aries or gemini
be subject to the stone
the retrogradation and burning of saturn and jupiter
spoil the hearing
and the teeth
when the moon &amp; mercury do not look between them
and do not regard the ascendant
nor the lord of the ascendant
the child shall be troubled in his understanding
the retrogradation of all the five planets
signifieth the falling sickness
the ill fortunes joined in the ascendant in evil aspects of the moon or the lord of the ascendant
denote entire folly
the part of sicknesses with his lord fortunate

chap xxii
of marriage
for the marriage
you must look the seven
house and his lord
the places of venus and the moon in the nativities of men
and in the places of the sun and of mars in nativities of women
and the parts of marriage
and the place of jupiter
if the said significators be fortunate
the marriage shall be happy
if they be unfortunate
it shall be full of envies
reproaches and evils
if some be fortunate
and some unfortunate by certain times
now happy
and then unhappy
it shall be manifest
many planets in the seventh house
give many women
likewise when many planets regard the said house or his lord
if venus
&amp; the lord of the seventh house be burned
or otherwise of saturn oppressed
the child shall never marry
jupiter and venus within the 6
or 8
signifieth that he shall marry a widow
jupiter burned
signifieth as much
otherwise
if jupiter behold venus
and the other significators of marriage
it promiseth maids and virgins
if venus or jupiter
or the lord of the seventh house be joined to saturn
or if saturn be within the seventh house
the woman shall have some note of infamy
that is to understand
she shall be of a strange religion
or shall be a bastard
or shall be of the race of lepers
or of some other
by whom the parents have received some shame
or she shall be deformed
and her parents shall be of a very weak condition
mars in the said house
or beholding with evil aspect the significators of marriage
intermingle strife and contentions between the man and the wife
the same doth also venus in the seventh or twelfth house
mars in the ninth
asmuch in the nativities of women as of men
denoteth some manner of separation of marriage
and venus in the ninth
signifieth that the man shall hate his wife
not so much for the vice which he shall find in her
but of a desire to be solitary
the significators of marriage unfortunate
or within the houses cadents
signifieth the woman to be of a simple race
or the husband in the nativities of women
if venus and the lord of the seventh house
join with the significators of riches
beholding the lord of the ascendant with an amiable aspect
she gives much goods by reason of women
the significators of marriage within the third or ninth
or else where peregrine &apos;s
signify that he shall marry out of his country
the fortunes within the seventh house
denoteth happy marriage
the ill fortunes unhappy

denoteth that he shall see the death of his wife
the significators of marriage occidental
witness that he shall marry late
or in his youth take a wife older than himself
oriental
denoteth that he shall marry in his youth
or in his age marry a young wife
likewise you must judge of husbands in the nativities of women
chap
xxiii of a dowry and other goods by the means of marriage
because the eight house is succeeding to the seventh
by good reason it signifieth the profit of the significations of the seventh
that is to say
of marriage
if then in the eight there be any fortunate planet
or any part fortunate
the child shall have great dowry by his wife
and of that side shall meet with great inheritances &amp; great goods
to the contrary
if saturn and mars be unfortunate in the said house
he shall have small dowry
and the same shall never be fully paid
when the fortunes be in the said house unfortunate
he hath hope of great goods the which in the end he shall not enjoy
the lord of the said place unfortunate
denoteth as much
and if he be fortunate and coupled with the significators of riches
it denoteth great goods and great profit on that side
it happeneth well sometimes when the seventh house is fortunate
and the eight unfortunate
as that which signifieth a little dowry &amp; desperation of other goods towards his wife
&amp; that always he shall be enriched by the diligence
industry
and faithfulness of his wife
chap xxiiii
of the death
you must first consider if there be any planet in the eight house
for it is convenient to take it for significator of the death
if within the said house there be never a planet
take them for significators that be in the seventh
preferring him always that is best dignified
if within the seventh you find none
draw the significator of the death from these places which follow
of the ascendant and of his lord
of the eight house and of his lord
of the part of death and of his lord
of the eight sign
from the place of the sun &amp; of his lord
of the eight sign
from the moon and of his lord
of the place of the first lord of the triplicity of the fourth angle
of the place of the planet which hath dignity of term
to the degree of the seventh house
the planet which in all these places shall be most dignified
shall be principal significator of death
if saturn being in the eight or seventh house
or otherwise more dignified in the above said points of the figure
he is principal significator of the death
if he be well disposed
it witnesseth
that the same party shall die of the dropsy
of some great stopping of the liver
and of the spleen
or of a quartern fever
of the flux of the belly
of pthisick
or of some burning fever
and of impostumations of the ears
etc
if it be greatly unfortunate
and together with the lord of the ascendant
and the luminaries temporally be evil disposed
it denoteth violent death by impostumes
palsies
falling down of humours
suffocations
overflown with water
when it is in watery signs
by some fall or ruin
when it is in earthly signs
by great blows
for to be hanged when it is in airy signs
if jupiter be significator of the death
it denoteth that he shall die of a pleurisy
of a squinance
or of some hot appostumations of the liver
or of the lungs
or of other sicknesses coming of wind or of blood
and that if he be fortunate
for when he is evil disposed and unfortunate
it maketh him die by the hand of justice
by the commandment of the prince
by sentence of the judge or of the marshal
by overflowing in waters
to be whipped and scourged
by long imprisonment
if it be mars well disposed
by continual tertian fevers
by flux of blood
by carbuncles and pestilences
by impostumes coming of choleric matters
burnings by too much using of women
if he be very evil disposed
it maketh him to be hanged and strangled
or smothered
or otherwise killed in his bed
or on his horse
when he is an airy sign or partaker within the water
when he is a watery sign or fallen from on high
or of some ruinous murderer
when he is a terrestial
or burned
when he is a fiery sign
principally if the lord of the ascendant and the luminaries temporally be unfortunate by mars
if it be the sun well disposed
he shall die of some hot disease
if it be unfortunate
by the commandment of the prince
or by sentence of the judge
or he shall die among a great company of men
subject to death
or in prison
or in a dungeon
or in some other stinking and filthy place
if it be venus well disposed
he shall die of too much eating fruits
or with too much continuing his voluptuousness
or of some fistula or impostume
if she be unfortunate
it denoteth death by venom
principally when she is burned
or joined to saturn
or of too much burning affection of love
or of great griefs of the french pocks
if it be mercury fortunate
it maketh him die by sadness
by great apprehensions
by the yellow jaundice
by pthisickes
by the burning fever
or by too much watching
if he be greatly unfortunate
it signifieth that he shall die by madness
the falling-sickness
by violent coughs
with breaking in sunder the veins
by foolish melancholy
by jealousy
if it be the moon well disposed
with too much eating moist meats
by drinking water
by too much continuing his pleasure
if she be unfortunate
you must consider the nature of him which is unfortunate
for if it be mars he shall die by fire
or by hurt
or by abortisment if it be a woman
if it be saturn
by ruins
falls
pestilences
and like accidents
before concluding of what death the party shall die
you must consider the disposition of the lord of the ascendant
and of the luminaries temporal
for if they be well disposed
the death shall not be violent
although the principal significator be greatly unfortunate
if the said significator be unfortunate
together with the luminaries temporal
or the lord of the ascendant evil disposed
we esteem certainly that the death shall be violent
if jupiter or venus do not intermingle their favourable beams
and then the said person shall fall in great danger of the said violent death
&amp; from the which he shall always escape miraculously
if one of the ill fortunes be in the sign of cancer
and the other in the sign of the lion
the death shall be violent
likewise
if any of the said ill fortunes be in the sign of the lion
and the luminaries temporal
or the lord of the ascendant be unfortunate
and one of the ill fortunes be in the first house
and the other in the seventh or fourth
or one of them in the tenth and the other in the fourth
the sun
or the moon
or the lord of the ascendant
joined with mars
have right in one fixed star
which the astrologers call the head of meduse
or otherwise the head of the devil
maketh him by the hand of the executioner to lose his head
when the sun
and the moon
and saturn
and mars
occupy the 4
angles of heaven
or at the least 3
the person shall die a horrible death
for he shall lose his head
or be cut in four quarters
or be drawn with four horses
principally
if in the said angles be the signs of gemini
pisces and aquarius
mars in the ninth or eight in the sign of aquarius or of gemini
opposite to the moon
or the lord of the ascendant
without good aspect of fortunes
maketh him perish by sulphur or fire from heaven
saturn in the twelfth
sixth
eight
or fourth house unfortunate
the lord of the said houses maketh him die in prison
or else where in great pain and travail
principally when the luminaries temporal
or the lord of the ascendant be unfortunate in any of the said houses
the tail of the dragon being joined to the significators of death
denote poisons
venims
and violent medicines
or ill applied
and flux of the belly
mars within the fourth
eight
twelfth
or sixth unfortunate
their lords and the luminaries temporal
or the lord of the ascendant
witness violent death
by the shedding of blood or otherwise
the significators of death within the ninth or third house
signify that the person shall die by the way
or in a strange country
except they be in their own proper houses or exaltations
for than he shall die in his house
&amp; bring his evil from the high ways
the said significators in their proper houses or exaltations
make him die in his house
if they be peregrine &apos;s
they make him die out of his house
the moon joined to a fixed star
named the claire of the balance meridional
denoteth violent death
that doth she also when she is joined with other stars that have the nature of the luminaries
mars in the viii
house with the head of the dragon
maketh him to be hanged and strangled
many planets within the seventh house
make him die of some strange and terrible kind of death
saturn
mars
and the head of the dragon in the first
venus and mercury with the tail in the seventh
make the body in a thousand pieces
if the principal significator be burned in his own proper house or exaltation
without being otherwise unfortunate
it maketh him die suddenly of some feebleness
or other sudden and secret accident
without other violence
the fortunes well disposed in the eight house
preserve him always from violent death
chap xxv
of voyages by land and by sea
jupiter
venus
the sun and mercury fortunate in the ninth house
denote that he shall be happy in voyages by land and by sea
saturn and mars signify to the contrary
and principally saturn doth hinder the voyages by water
and mars the ways by land
if within the ninth house there be never a planet
you must consider the moon
and the lord of the ninth
and the parts of the ways and voyages by land and by water
with their lords
the which fortunate
giveth profitable navigations
unfortunate
denote the contrary
likewise you must judge of the third house and of his lord
when they be well or evil disposed
the head of the dragon in the ninth
favoureth greatly to the fortune of voyages
and the tail to the contrary
chap
xxvi
of the constancy in his religion
also as the head of the dragon
the luminaries
and mercury in the ninth house well disposed
denote entire faith and constancy in his religion
saturn
mars
and the tail of the dragon do hinder it
saturn of his nature is most inclined to the law of the jews
and mars to the law of the turks &amp; mahometists
the tail of the dragon
causeth him always to err from the truth of the law
the lord of the ninth
and the part of the faith
with his dominator fortunate
yieldeth a man constant in his faith
unfortunate maketh him variable
if the part of the spirit be in the sign of the lion at the birth of a christian
he shall be very constant in his religion
if the sun be fortunate
if he be unfortunate by saturn
to go from his faith
and to address it to that of the jews
if he be unfortunate by mars
it maketh him more to incline to the law of the turks and mahometists
if the said part be in the houses of saturn at the nativity of a jew
or in the houses of mars at the nativity of a turk
they shall deny their law
if the said lords of the said part be retrogrades
or otherwise ill disposed
saturn in the ninth at the nativity of a jew
doth nothing diminish his faith
saturn in the said house when he is fortunate
signifieth dreams to be true
mars and the tail of the dragon signify them vain and false
the other significators do aslure them to be true
chap xxvii
of the action and profession
how to know of what profession the child shall be
you must chiefly consider if any planet be in the tenth house
for he shall be significator of the profession
otherwise
you must come to the part of fortune
and to his lord
to the part of the profession
and to his lord
to the tenth house
and to his lord
and to the places of mars
mercury and venus
the planet that upon these places shall have the most dignities
shall be significator of the profession
the which if it be saturn
it shall signify a husbandman
a good housekeeper
a receiver of rents
and many times a governor of towns
when he is in angles fortunate
jupiter denoteth the officers
judges
benefices
prelates
bishops
governors of the goods of the church
mars signifieth captains
men of war
coiners
foregoers
and other that use to work with fire and iron
and physicians when he is in the aspect of venus
sol representeth princes
lords
magistrates
hunters
treasurers and archers
venus &apos; players
dancers
perfumers
appothecaries
and in aspect of mars
physicians
mercury
advocates
notaries
registers
poets
rhymers
philosophers
mathematicians
diviners
writers
messengers and traders
the moon
ambassadors
counsellors
consuls
rulers of common wealth
travailers
hunters
if there be many significators
or if the principal be coupled with many planets
you must mingle the significations of the one and of the other
and of the said mixture
gather together the profession coming of the concurrence of the stars
you must also consider in what house the said significators be
if they be within the second
the profession shall be of feats of merchandise and traffics
if within the third or ninth
of feats of religion
or gathering the goods of the church
if in angles
of dominations &amp; governments
if in the fifth of embassages
legations
and other things of pleasure
if in the sixth
of feats of diseases
of servants and of cattle
etc
if the part of the honour coming of the profession
be with his lord fortunate
the infant shall obtain great credit and honour because of his profession
if they be unfortunate
if he do never so well
he shall never gain to himself honour in the feats of his profession
chap xxviii
of dignities
offices
and honours
for the dignities
offices
charges and honours
you must have respect to the tenth house
to the luminaries temporal
to the part of nobleness
to the part of government
to the part of magistrates
&amp; others appertaining to the tenth house
with their lords
the planet that in the said places shall have most dignities
shall be significator of the said considerations in good or evil
according to his good or evil disposition
particularly also you must follow the said places one after another to know of what side principally the said dignities
offices and honours ought to come
saturn in the tenth house
or in the ascendant in nativities by day
signifieth great advancement and honour after thirty years
when he is not evil disposed
in nativities by night
it denoteth continual fear
to receive damage of princes and kings
mars in the said places in nativities by night
signifieth also great advancement
&amp; by day more than saturn
the part of government and his lord within any of the angles
witness great favour of kings
likewise you must judge of the other part that we have deducted upon the tenth house
mercury in the tenth well disposed and fortunate
promiseth dignities
offices and honours
by reason of knowledge
venus and the moon because of women
jupiter for his virtue
the sun and the head of the dragon in the same house
denoteth as much
the two luminaries in their houses or exaltations placed in the figure of heaven
do denote great advancement &amp; honour
that which jupiter doth also when he receiveth the virtue of all the other planets
&amp; communicateth his own to saturn and the sun
and the fortunes and the luminaries when they be in the angles of heaven
many planets in the fourth house
denoteth great honour after death
if in the points of the angles be any fixed star of the first or second greatness
or other having the nature of luminaries
it is a great sign of incredible advancement
that which happeneth also when the said stars be joined to the luminaries temporal
or to the part of fortune
or to his lord
or to the planets and parts that be in the angles
they which have saturn in the tenth burned
or the lord of the tenth burned
or be by saturn oppressed
or that have the tail of the dragon in the tenth
receive commonly some form of dishonour
and often be deprived of their estate
when the fortunes do not intermingle their favourable beams
except when they be also unfortunate in their proper houses or exaltations
or in the signs of aries and the lyon
you must note that saturn &amp; mars
hinder greatly the good fortunes
until that the man hath passed the number of years correspondent to the number of the small years of the said planets
and if they hinder any more time
it shall be until that the man shall accomplish the number of years answering to the number of degrees
of the overthwart ascensions of the sign
in the which they shall be at the nativity
chap xxix
of companions and friends
you must for the companions and friends
have respect to jupiter
the eleventh house
the part of friends
the part of honourable companions
the planet having most dignities in the said places
shall be principal significator of friends
the which after his good or evil disposition
shall denote honourable
faithful
and profitable friends
or unprofitable
disloyal
and of base condition
jupiter and the sun in the said house
signify honourable companies and profitable
so doth venus
the moon and mercury also in the said place
saturn in the eleventh fortunate
witnesseth grave friends
ancient and honourable
mars
men of war
captains and lords
saturn or mars in the eleventh out of their principal dignities
deprived of the beams of the favourable planets
signify some great suit against his friends
or some great evil by reason of them
as it happeneth commonly to the answers and sureties
the parts of honourable companions and of praise
with their lords fortunate
signifieth profit and honour on the side of friends
unfortunate denoteth the contrary
the part of friends denoteth as much
the head of the dragon in the eleventh house
giveth favour of friends
the tail denoteth a thousand mischiefs by reason of them
chap
xxx
of suits and enemies
the fortunes in the seventh and twelfth house
give victories against enemies
when they be in good aspect to the lord of the ascendant
and commonly those which have these 2
houses with their lords fortunate
be happy in their suits
the contrary you must judge
when they with their lords be unfortunate
the ill fortunes in the said places
signify much strifs and enemies
that doth also the parts of enemies
and of discord and accord
when they and their lords be evil disposed
the lord of the twelfth house fortunate
it denoteth little puissance of enemies
unfortunate denoteth the contrary
if one of the two ill fortunes be in the twelve
and the other in the sixth
in evil aspect of the luminaries temporal
or of the lord of the ascendant
the child shall be killed by his enemies
they which have saturn
or mars
or the moon opposite to the sun in the sign of cancer
be commonly contrary to all the world
mars in any of the four angles
engendereth naturally strife
suits
debates
and enmities against all the world
except when he is in a good aspect of jupiter and venus
for than he doth expel his ire and anger against the vices
&amp; of great zeal maintaineth the right of every one
the lord of the ascendant
or the moon
or the sun unfortunate in the twelve house
denoteth great persecutions and calamities of the enemies
the lord of the ascendant by the lord of the twelve oppressed
testifieth that he shall die by the hand of his enemies
the lord of the twelve
and the planets that be in the seventh &amp; twelve house
signify the quality of enemies
that is to understand
the sun signifieth the princes &amp; great lords
the moon all the world
and mars the men of war
etc
chap
xxxi
of imprisonments and captivities
the lord of the ascendant
or the moon or the sun greatly unfortunate in the 12
6
8
and 4
house
do signify imprisonments
and death within the prisons
or in captivity

etc
all these be the foundations and roots of the judgements astronomical
from the which you may not serve or depart
except in asmuch as be mitigated
prohibited
or augmented by the concurrences and aspects of the planets
and conjunction of the fixed stars
the end of the second book
of judgements astronomical upon nativities
containing the directions and revolutions
the third book
chap
i
of directions
the art of directions so diligently entreated upon by john de regiomount
that their is no more place fitly to speak of the same
except that with the aid of god we have purposed to translate into french his problems and documents appertaining to the said matter
nevertheless we will here touch the the principal point
to direct
which term i use being being most commonly used and of long time received
although it be not proper
it is no other thing then to stay the meeting of one place of the heavens with another consequently following
according to the natural order of the signs
&amp; that the moving of the first mobile
the first place is named the significator
the second the promittor
as if the ascendant were in the xx
degree of sagittarius &amp; saturn in thex of capricorn
one might direct the ascendant to saturn &amp; the ascendant shall be significator of life
&amp; saturn promittor of death or sickness
&amp; then the judgement shall be danger of death
there is another form of direction attributed to the parts &amp; planets retrogrades
which do make following the natural course of their mobile
to the contrary of the consequence of the signs
of the which the craft is like to the 1
&amp; there is no difference but that we have called significator
which is here promittor
and the promittor is here significator
the point meridional of the tenth house
you must direct by the right ascensions
the point of the ascendant
by the ascensions obliques
found in the table of the latitude of your region
the points and stars that shall be between the merydian and the horizon
by the oblique ascensions under the circle in the which they be
the which you call
the circle of position
the which for to find
and likewise to have the ascensions of every place having latitude or no
you must follow the method following
first
you must take the longitudes of planets
fixed stars
and other places that you would direct
that is to say
the sign
degree
and minute that they ● olde in the zodiac and in the ephemerideses
or other tables astronomical
etc
secondly
you must calculate their latitudes
in degrees and minutes placed in the ephemerideses
thirdly
their declination by the first problem of the book of directions of regiomont
then
their right ascensions by the third problem of the said house
then again
the distances of the circle meridional by the nineteenth problem
incontinent
the circles of their positions
by the twentieth problem
consequently the differences ascensional by the table expressed
and finally the oblique ascensions by the tenth canon
if the said stars be between the point meridional of the tenth house
and the point of the fourth
or the dissensions of obliques by the eleventh problem
if they be between the point of the fourth and the tenth
this done
take out the number of the oblique ascensions of the significator
of the number of the oblique ascensions of the promittor
take to the table of the position of the significator
or the contrary
if you direct the parts and planets retrogrades
that which resteth of degrees &amp; minutes
turn into years
months &amp; days
and by this means
you shall have exactly the time of good or evil that shall happen unto you by direction
intending that one degree is here signified a year
five minutes a month
one minute 6
days &amp; some odd hours
he that would help the seconds he shall touch the end more perfectly
for to know the sicknesses and danger of death
you must direct the five vital places that we have considered
searching the giver of life
in fixed stars of violent nature in the point of the fourth
sixth
seventh and eight
and the tail of the dragon
to the ill fortunes and their evil aspects in the parts of death
and by and by to the sun
and to the head of the dragon
likewise for the same consideration
you must direct the said pernicious places to the five vital places
and they meeting
they judge that the man is in great danger of death
when the fortunes do not show forth their favourable beams
for the goods
honour
dignities
friendships
and other considerations
you must direct the one significator of goods with the other
and the one significator of honour with the others
of the which we have made mention in the first book
following the particular judgements of the nativities
chap 2
of the separator or burner
called of the arabians
algebuthar
the separator or burner
is the planet which hath dignity of term &amp; degree
to the which the year is answerable
multiplied with the ascensions of one significator
for to find the separator of the like
you must take the oblique ascensions of the ascendant
and add unto the same the years of your age
and search it all in the table of the latitude of your region
to look to which sign and degree the said number answereth
for unto that point shall come the perfection of your life
look afterward which is the planet which hath dignity of term in the said degree
for of the self same shall be the separator of the life
by the same means you may seek the separators of the honour
goods
gains
friends
and of other like
upon the circles of their positions
the which is convenient to seek following the aforesaid method of directions
chap
iii
of the lords of the triplicities
you must also note all the lords of the triplicities
in places which signify good and evil
as well in significations of life
as of goods
friends
honour
marriages
pilgrimages etc
if they be well disposed in the revolution
they shall signify well
touching the signification of the place of the which they be lords
if they be unfortunate
they signify evil
that is to understand
the lords of the triplicities of vital places
will signify of the life
of the places of fortune
riches &amp; profit
of places of honour
of the honour
good or evil
according as they be fortunate or unfortunate at the hour
of the revolution
chap iiii
of revolutions
the sun returning to the same point in the which he was at the hour of the nativity
maketh the revolution every year
he therefore that would know the hour and minute of the revolution
he must look in the ephemerideses
at what hour and minute the sun began to enter into the degree minute and second
in which he was at the hour of the nativity
if the ephemerideses do not suffice you for this matter
go to a table made for the same purpose
by peter pitat
in the beginning of the same ephemerideses
by him corrected and augmented
jerom cardin useth another
which i find very exact
the which he hath written in his book
of the restitution of times and celestial motions
in the fifth chapter
chap v
of the judgements upon the revolutions
first look how the separator of life is disposed in the figure of the revolution
for if he be unfortunate
he denoteth sickness and other dangerous accidents
if he be fortunate
he holdeth him healthful and glad all the year
so likewise you must judge of the separator of goods
friends
dignities &amp; other effects
it is to understand
that they give good fortune in the said significations
if they be well disposed
or else loss &amp; evil fortune if they be unfortunate
in the second place
look if the lords of the triplicities of the vital places be well disposed
and of places which signify riches
honour
travails
brethren
parents
wives and children
do so much
for in the same significations the man shall be happy or unhappy
according as the said lords shall be well or evil disposed
and principally you must consider the lord that shall reign over your age
for the first lord of one triplicity governeth the first age
the second
the midst of the life
the third
the latter year
thirdly
you must consider which is the planet which governeth over the year of your age
that which the arabians call fridate
fourthly
the lord of the sign in which shall come the same year of perfection
in the fifth place
the lord of the circulation
accounting by the lord of the hour of the nativity
then the lord of the circulation
accounting by the lord of the ascendant of the nativity
and if in the ascendant of the nativity there be any planet
you must likewise make circulation
furthermore
you must look if any planet return to the same sign and house
in the which it was at the nativity
for than it intendeth the same effect which it hath signified in the nativity
principally when it returneth to the same sign
you must also have regard to the aspects which are made in the revolution
if they be like to them of the nativity
for that shall be a renewing of the effects of the said aspects
and you must not forget the changing of the places
for if a happy planet be in the revolution in the place where an evil planet was in the nativity
the evil signified by the said evil planet in the nativity
shall be deferred that year by the presence of the happy planet
to the contrary
if a planet promise any good fortune in the nativity
and in his place in the revolution be any unfortunate planet
the same good signified in the nativity
shall be diminished in the revolution
or lost by reason of the said ill fortune
the misfortune in the places of misfortune augmenteth the evil
the good fortunes in the places of good fortune
augmenteth the good fortune
for to judge of the said considerations
you must have recourse to that which we have said in the two former books of general and particular significations of the houses
signs
planets
aspects
&amp; particular situations of the planets in signs and houses
having always before your eyes
the disposition of stars in the figure of the nativity
for if a planet be in the nativity greatly unfortunate
and in the revolution well disposed
it cannot much profit because of the first infelicity
likewise you must judge of those which be fortunate in nativities
which being unfortunate in revolutions
do no great damage
there be some that contemplate hereupon
many other things
the which by experience i have often found unprofitable
false
and superfluous
chap vi
of the years governed by the planets
called of the arabians fridarie
if the nativity be by day
than the sun governeth the first ten years
venus eight years following
mercury thirteen years after that
then the moon
the nine following
saturn eleven years
jupiter twelve
mars seven
the head of the dragon three
the tail of the dragon two
when it is by night
you must begin at the moon
the which governeth the first nine years
than saturn
jupiter
mars
sol
venus
mercury
the head of the dragon
and the tail
the numbers by order as we have said before
many by great curiosity
have added to this company other planets to every government
the which i find by good reason to be reprehended by the chaldeans
for experience hath often taught me and other very expert in this science
that this subtlety is too curious
vain and superfluous
the table of the fridaries by day

vii
of profections
for the profections you must resolve the twelve houses of your nativity in equal parts upon the eclipse
so far as the ascendant is in the first degree of any sign
the second house shall be in the first degree of a sign following
and the third
in the first degree of a third sign
and to conclude
that every house begin by the first degree
as the first house
also
every house will contain thirty degrees
&amp; the first thirty degrees of the first house
shall appertain to the first year wherein the infant is borne
the thirty of the second
to the second year
the thirty of the third to the third year
&amp; so consequently until twelve
twelve years passed
you must begin again at the first
and then come to the second
third
fourth etc
and so from twelve to twelve you must renew the same circuit
if you find the revolution within the thirty degrees serving to your year
it signifieth some good or evil
according to his nature or good or evil disposition
&amp; signification of the place
of which shall be the said profection
that is to say
of the places of life
sickness
death
or good health
of the places of goods
riches
loss
or poverty
etc
commonly they seek the profection of five places of one nativity
that is to say
of the place of the sun for honour
of the place of the moon for the qualities of the spirit
towards the body and external goods
of the place of the part of fortune
for gain and profit
of the tenth house for the actions
of the ascendant for the life
if the sun be giver of life
it must be considered as giver of life and giver of honour likewise
the which you must do also in other places
when they import many significations
if then you find any planet within the thirty degrees of your profection
and would know what month or day the accident by him signified shall happen
look what distance you have between the first point of your profection
and the said planet
if there be xv
degrees between them
the said accident shall happen out in the end of six months
if there be twentie-five degrees
at the end of ten months
for here two degrees and a half
value one month
one degree valueth twelve days and four hovers
thirty minutes value six days
five minutes one day
of this there is a very exact table among the documents of peter pytat upon the ephemerideses
example of the profections
suppose that the ascendant of a nativity was the fifteen degree of scorpius
i would know where the profection shall light of the ascendant at the end of ten years after the childborn
i account ten signs from the ascendant
after that
i find the fifteen degree of virgo serving after ten years
accomplished to xj
current
i say then that in the said time
the profection of the ascendant is come in the fifteen degree of virgo
&amp; shall end that year in the fifteen degree of libra
and also shall contain thirty whole degrees
within the which if any planet be found
it shall signify good or evil of the life
according to the nature &amp; disposition as if in the said time
mars being to the fifth degree of libra
i would say that the infant should be troubled that year at the end of eight months
because that mars was in the place profectional of life
distant from the first point twenty degrees
we have showed before that two degrees and a half value one month
five degrees two months
and fifteen degrees six months
and by course twenty degrees eight months
you must note
that the profections ought to fit to the years currant or complete
it is to be understood the tenth sign
as for incontinent after nine years complete
which is ten years currant
etc
chap
viii
the lords of the circulations from the hours of the nativities
the babylonians hold for a great secret
the circulation of the lord of the hour of the nativity
it is to be understood
that the lord of the said hour signifieth of the life as the ascendant
and the lord of the hour following
of goods as of the second house
and the lord of the third hour of brethren as the third house
and so consequently of others
in revolutions
they give the lord of the hour of the nativity to the first year
the planet following to the second
and so consequently following the natural order of the planets
as if one were borne in the hour of venus
that planet should reign the first year
the second year
mercury
the third
the moon
the fourth
saturn
the fift
jupiter
the sixth
mars
the seventh sol
the eight
venus
the ninth
mercury
and so by order
and you must note
that we take here the years currant
and not complete
for to fit the said circulation of the planets
chap
ix
of the circulation of the lord of the ascendant
and the planets which are in the ascendant
the circulation of the lord of the ascendant
and the planets and parts which be in the ascendant
they be even as we have said of the lord of the hour of the nativity
and by the same order you must place them
the years of the age of the child
by judgement
we have made mention and proof of revolutions
chap
x
of eclipses and great conjunctions appertaining to revolutions of nativities
the eclipse of the sun
and the conjunctions of the superior planets
causeth commonly many evils
after the congruence of the stars
and nature of the signs and planets reigning in the said places
to men causeth sicknesses
when they be within the five next degrees of the ascendant
or to the giver of life
if they touch the other parts
planets or houses
they pronounce evil fortune
appertaining to the significations of the same places
principally
if in the same time of the nativity
any such constellations were in force
if they touch the places perfectionals
they do almost the same effect as in nativities
chap
xi
of the particular meetings of the whole year
concerning the particular meetings of all the year
and many others
do rest hard upon the profections
mensturnes and diurnes
of the which you have a perfect table in the book of directions of john de regiomonte
having more subtlety &amp; curiousness then truth
as i have often found by experience
it answereth better my opinion schonor
which every day considered
if any planet touch the places of the planets
parts &amp; houses
of the nativity or their good or evil aspect
that i do apply to the places profectional
as for example
let the ascendant of a nativity
or the place of his profection be the twelve degree of libra
the sun in the fifteenth of gemini
mars in the fifteenth of leo
always
and as often as the sun or the moon do pass over the xv
degree of leo
the man shall be moved by angry accidents
as of displeasure
of some alteration
pain of the head
fever
hot impostumes
tetters
etc
likewise when it toucheth the fifth degree of scorpius
or of taurus
there where the quadrate aspects be within the place of mars
or the fifth of aquarius
which is the place opposite to mars
if any planet touch the fifth degree of libra
or of gemini
there where the sextile aspects be
or the fifth of sagitarius and of aries
which make the trine aspects of the said mars
it shall signify some favourable meetings of captains and men of war
if the ill fortunes touch not the said twelve degree of libra
as we have said in the ascendant
that shall be sign of some evil meeting
as well to life as to the body
likewise you must judge of other attachments
according to the nature of the aspects
by us explained in the second book
you must contemplate the places profectionals
for i do apply every degree and minute to the days in the which their signification fall
and regard the good &amp; evil aspects of the planets every day
if they touch the degree profectional
as for example
of the said nativity in the which was the ascendant libra
suppose that the profection was come to the twelve degree of cancer
in the ninth year complete and the tenth currant
the thirteenth degree of cancer
serveth to the twelve day after the proper day of the revolution
wherefore i consider then the aspects of the planets towards the said thirteenth degree
likewise so i do of other degrees and minutes
fitted to those days in the which they govern
and so much for revolutions

a letter sent from sarient mayor forbes from the king of sweden &apos;s army to his reverend father mr john forbes
minister to the worshipful company of merchant adventurers residing in delft
touching the great battle fought by lypsick between the king of sweden
the duke of saxons army
and the emperor &apos;s army
and that commanded by general tilly
of the catholic league the 7 of september 1631
honoured and loving father upon the fourth of this month of september
it pleased god that the king &apos;s army &amp; the duke of saxons joined together
near unto a town called dieben and marched forward towards lypsick
which general tilly had taken in and lay with his army about half a mile from it
where he met us with his army
and took up the best advantage of ground for his men
and planted his ordinance upon the places
which he thought fittest
the king &apos;s army marched on the right hand of the battle
and the dukes on the left
and so advanced in battleray against out enemy
who began to play despitefully with his ordinance upon us
which we cared not much for
but advanced forward with our ordinance likewise playing before us
they seeing us marching towards them
they advanced likewise towards us
and came so close one to an other
that joining battalions together
we came to push of the pike
and disputed the business so long
till it pleased god that we routed them and gave us the victory
by putting the enemy to a retreat with the kings own army
but the duke &apos;s army was vilely beaten back
and began to make a shameful flight
so that we were forced to send our horse men after these that were beaten
and to relieve the duke &apos;s men with our foot
which doing we put all the enemy at last to flight
and followed the execution very hotly till it was dark night
&amp; till we could not see to pursue them any further
for which victory immortal thanks be given to god
the enemy was at least 40000 allfighting men and our army
and the duke &apos;s cold make not above 36000 men horse and foot
the next day there was found dead on both sides slain upon the place of battle 10000 bodies
whereof the most of them were the enemies
besides these that were slain upon their flight &amp; execution which were connted to be as great a number
there were taken in all about 8000 prisonners
the most of them having taken entertainment of the king
and marches with our army
there were divers colonel &apos;s of note slain on both sides
general tilly was shot and hurt three times
the lord martial schoonburck slain
and five other colonel &apos;s
the duke of holsteyne taken prisoner
who afterward died of his wounds
besides diverse other lieutenant &apos;s colonels
captains and officers
which would be too long to relate
of our side there were slain colonel devil
collonele hall
colonel cullenburck
and lieutenant colonel adercus
colonel turnill hurt
and my colonel hurt
besides divers captains
lieutenants &amp; ensigns
we have taken two and twenty pieces of canon
whereof there are seven which were the king of bohemia &apos;s
lost at the battle of prage
besides great store of powder
bullets
match
and munition of war
52 colours of foot and 37
cornets of horse this is the truth of the great victory which god hath given us which you may report for a certain
for i write no more unto you but that which i saw with my own eyes
i would have written to divers others
but i pray you let this letter suffice for all
and when any other occasion shall offer it self
you shall hear further from me
no more at this time
but my duty remembered to your self my mother
and my love to my brethren and sisters
and all other my friends
i commit you to the protection of him that hath given us this glorious victory and rest
your loving son
from the king &apos;s army at hall the tenth of september 1631 the rest of the kings proceeding in the countries and towns which he hath taken in since that battle as they follow in time
i take it this generation do live in that age this prophecy shall be fulfiled revelation
o heavens rejoice of her
and the holy apostles and prophets
for god hath given your judgement on her for your sakes
here the holyghost doth describe the joy and rejoicing of all the faithful for the destruction of the romish superstition
and human inventions
by heaven here is meant
the faithful professors of the truth
because they belong to heaven
and have their meditations in heaven
by apostles and prophets are not meant those famous preachers which lived in former ages
but are to be taken for those faithful teachers which witness god &apos;s truth on earth in his militant church
as for our matters on earth they belong not to those blessed souls which are and have been resting so long blessedly in heaven
for dead men
saith the scripture
know nothing any more here
and therefore saith the prophet
that abraham is ignorant of us
and that israel knows us not isay
therefore this is the rejoicing of all god &apos;s people at the abolishing of all humane inventions in god &apos;s worship
and they rejoice at the advancing of all the institutions of christ
that he may reign as king in his church by his own laws and ordinances as the apostle testifieth 1
and this he is commanded to observe till the appearing of jesus christ to judgement the 6
therefore not in the liberty of earthly potentates to alter
for christ shall reign
amen
an other book against rastell named the subsidy or bulwark to his first book
made by john frithe prisoner in the tower
awake thou that slepeste and stand up from death
and christ shall give the light
ephesians
the prologue
it needeth not christian reader
i think now that thou haste over red and diligently pondered in thine inward senses
that the treatise of john frith where in he confuteth all the reasons which rastell
more
and rochester made for the maintenance &amp; upholding of the bitter pains of purgatory
to commend unto the this brief work following named a subsidy defence or bulwark to the same
and much less needeth it to dehort the from the vain &amp; childish fear which our fore fathers have had of that place of purgatory
as their good-works which at this day remain upon the earth founded for their thence deliverance do testify
and for as much as thou art a christian man &amp; rejoicest in christ i dare boldly affirm for thee
that thou takest neither pleasure nor joy of that place
like as some persons do
which triumphed of late &amp; with much joy and clapping of hands
send tidings in to all parties that purgatory was found again
because they read in a book named the institution of a christian man this word purgatory
and yet have i not heard hitherto that the self persons have showed any tokens of gladness
for god &apos;s word translated in to english so that to me they seam to rejoice more to have the silly souls purged with punishments
when they be departed then to have them purged with the word of god while they be here
who will think but as they have uttered their hearts concerning purgatory with their tongues
even so they say in their stomachs
that their holy father the pope
whom we may as justly call the bishop of rome
saying
christ is
he is there the heed of
peter &apos;s church as we may call the heed of s
paul &apos;s church in london bishop of london
hath recovered again here in england his old authority
ye that he never yet lost it because they find in their church &apos;s
bells &amp; beads
with other like holiness
&amp; on them selves long gowns shaven crowns &amp; fingers anointed with the holy oil of ydeldes
for who will say but that these holy relics declare the bishop of rome as clarklye as this word purgatory proveth a place to be
where souls after the departure from their bodies suffer pains &amp; punishments
doth not this pretty pageant of purgatory signify &amp; pronosticat what tragedy they will play hereafter
when the word of god shall blow &amp; scatter from the face of the earth the dark clouds &amp; mists of men &apos;s inventions
&amp; shall score away the rust of fleshly understanding of the scriptures in other things like wise as it hath done in this
if aught may be found in that book where with they may resist
that such things may be picked out of it
the fruit which commonly hath come of all counsels convocations &amp; synods sithence the apostles time
very few excepted
causeth me somewhat to fear for if a man way the good with the bade that hath sprung from them
he will perchance think that the lay people of all estates may well &amp; justly say farewell the one with the other
no marvel for they have not been all the children of one father that have been in counsels as they have not been all sheep that hath gone in sheeps clothing
&amp; oft times the greater part over cometh the better
which things gathered by experience &amp; by reading causeth me often times to wish that
they which would be counted sincere &amp; true ministers of the gospel either might &amp; would clean abstain from such counsels that they have no part in them
or else that they would give no more place to the fruits of infidely
i mean men &apos;s inventions &amp; carnal interpretations which the faith in christ never begat
then saint paul gave to peter his college when he left the table of the gentiles &amp; went to the jews
which fact of peter in my judgement
paul mought more conveniently have approved saying peter did it to the intent he would not offend his weak bretherns the jews with his eating
then the true and sincere ministers of christ in the gospel may wink at many things used in this days among the disciples of the gospel
much less may they approve than with the fashion of there own living
&amp; confirm them with the authority of a counsel &amp; with preaching they say it is not time to speak against them
be it yet is it time to leave them &amp; no longer to seam to allow them
unless they intend always to walk in them had the author of this book looked after a time as some do he had not written against purgatory
when he did i fear me some maintain blindness more with there simulation than they open the light with there preaching
but this have i spoken good reader besides my purpose which was none other than to admonish the that although rochester
more &amp; rastell have all three
as thou perceivest by reading this former treatise
stiffly defended one
yet shouldest thou not have of all three one judgement or opinion
more and rochestre were men of high dignity in this world
the one a bishop
the other chancellor of this noble realm of england
both ancient in years of so great wit &amp; so singular erudition in all kind of learning esteemed aswell of them selves as of many other
that no ii like might in all this land be found
it was thought that for there dignity noman durst for there years wit &amp; learning noman was able to again say them
wherefore they were persuaded to be the most meat of all other to take in hand the defence of the terrible pains of purgatory either the very foundation
or else the chief building set upon the foundation of the church of rome rastell had nothing common with them
but only many years &amp; awyt sophistical which he called natural reason
as a ꝑtaininge to god &apos;s word he acknowleged himself ignorant thereof notwithstanding had such opinion of his wit that he thought he could as well prove purgatory by it as the other ii
had done by the scriptures wherein i think he was not deceived and as this iii persons were not like so took they the answer made to them not a like
more &amp; rochestre thought foul scorn
see what the glory of this world &amp; high estimation of our selves doth
that a young man of small reputation should take upon him so clean contrary to their opinion to writ against them
and to be short took the matter so grievously
that they could never after be quiet in their stomachs until they had drunken his blood rastell though he perceived his natural reason to be sore said to
yet was he not malicious as the other were and therefore wrote he again
which work of rastell came to his hands when he was prisoner in the tower of london
where he made the answer following to the same which answer after rastell had read
he was well content to count his natural reason foolishness and with hearty thanks given to god became a child again
and sucked of the wisdom which cometh from above &amp; saveth all that be nourished therewith
in the which he continued to his lives end with the honour and glory of god to whom be praise for ever
amen
here followeth the preface of this book
brother rastell i thank you that it had pleased you to be so favourable unto me a poor prisoner
as to show me a copy of your book which you have written to confute my reasons &amp; scripture that i have alleged against purgatory
for that hath caused me to make a subsidy defence &amp; bulwark to my book which by god &apos;s grace shall be an occasion to open more light
although not to you
yet at the leastwise unto them whose hearts the prince of this world hath
4 blinded but that the light of the gospel and glory of christ may shine in them and where as you write &amp; protest that you will bring no scripture against me
but only reharse my scripture again which i have alleged unꝑfeytlye and wound me with mine own darts
&amp; will but even do as one that playeth at tens with another tossing the ball again
i do very well admit your similitude
not withstadinge you know right well that it is not i enough for a man playing at tens to toss the ball again
but he must so toss it that the other take it not
for if the other smite it over again then is the game in as great jeopardy as it was before besides
that he must take heed that he neither smite to short of the line nor yet under
for than it is a loss and he had been better to let it go
and yet an ungracious post standeth in the way &amp; maketh the ball to rebound back again over the cord &amp; loseth the game
and that will anger a man
&amp; i ascertain you that ye have tossed never a ball but ye offend in one of this points
&amp; yet besides that sometime ye play a touch of legerdemain &amp; cast me a ball which when it commythe i perceive to be none of mine
&amp; all the court shall judge the same
this points shall be declared when we come to them
and now i will answer in order
an answer to rastell &apos;s first prologue
in your prologue you assigned
rastell two causes of the making of your i
book of purgatory without alleging any texts of scripture for the prove thereof which are the controversy of ii sorts of people
one sort you say be those that believe not in christ
but yet they will construe expound and interpret this texts after their own wills and obstinate mind
now let us consider your foresaid causes &amp; ponder whether your book have or may do any such good as you say pretended
&amp; whether it have converted those sorts of people
or else by any thing likely to do such a fact
and first let us see what it profiteth the first sort which are infideles not believing in christ nor his scripture
john
our saviour christ saith
he that believeth is not dampened
confirmeth the same saying
he that believeth in the son hath everlasting life
but he that believeth not in the son shall not see life
but the wrath of god abideth upon him
here it is evident not be my exposition
but by the consent of all christian men
that those in fideles are dampened
for what intent than should rastell teach them that there is a purgatory
without christ their is no way but dampnacy on as scripture &amp; all faithful men testify
then would i know by what way he would persuade that there were a purgatory
which should be away &amp; ameane to salvation and not to damnation
for them which believe not in christ
this i am sure of
&amp; i think rastell believeth it also
that the infidels shall never come in it though their were one
this you may see that his first cause is very vain
&amp; that if they did believe it they were in dead deceived
now let us proceed unto the second sort of people
which believe in christ &amp; his scripture &amp; yet misconstrue it
expounding it after their own wills
and let us see what fruit they take of this book &amp; what it profiteth them &amp; we shall find that it less serveth these men than the fryste
for if this men believe in christ &amp; in his scripture
them is it not possible that they should receive or admit that thing
which is against the scripture both by the exposition of them selves &amp; of all the world
for this is both against scripture and all faithful men that there should be any way to health if we exclude christ and his scripture and sith purgatory is counted away to health
he that would go about to prove it
secluding christ and scripture is against scripture and all faithful men
besides that if they be so obstinate that they will not receive the very scripture but expound it after their own wills &amp; wrest it after the same
then will they much less receive your book which is so plain against scripture
and therefore if you would think that they could be tamed by your book which notwitstanding so wresteth scripture
so that i can espy no manner of profit that can come of your book if you can allege no better causes than you yet show
but that it had been a great deal better on written
and brother rastell where you say that i advance &amp; boast my self much more than becometh me
and that i detraycte &amp; slander my neighbours
and that i provoke all men that read my book rather to vice than to virtue with such other things as ye lay to my charge
i trust i shall declare my inconvenience and give you a sufficient answer
an answer to rastell &apos;s first chapter which reproveth me for boosting my self
in the first chapter of this book rastell rastell laboureth to prove that i am sore over seen in lauding &amp; boasting my self
and that i like my self so well that he is sure that other men do like me the less
&amp; that he feareth that god will therefore like me &amp; favour me rather the worse than the better
here he jogeleth with me &amp; would make frith me believe that he tossed me mine own ball again
but when i behold it
i perceive it to be none of mine
for he hath cut out all that should make for me so that he hath given it clean an other shape
than ever i intended that it should have as it appeareth by his writing which rehearseth my words in this manner
i am sure there are many that marvel rastell
that i being so young dare atempte to dispute this matter against these iii persons
but my words are this
i am sure that frith there are many that will much marvel that i being so young and of so small learning dare dispute this matter
here rastell leaveth out the words
and of so smake learning
for if he had put that in he had bewrayed him self
for i think no man so mad as to say that he which sayeth him self to be both young &amp; of small learning should praise &amp; boast him self
also immediately after the words of his first allegation i say on this manner
and as touching my learning i must needs acknowledge
as the truth is
that it is very small which i think is but a base boasting
and anon after i say i would not that any man should admit my words or learning except they will stand with the scripture
&amp; be approved thereby
lay them to the touchstone and try them with god &apos;s word
if they be found false and contrary then damn them
and i shall also revoke them with all mine heart
i exhorted them to read my book not advertising who speaketh the words but rather what is spoken
by why the words you might well see that i intended not to boast my self
and all this have i written
and he left it out even in the first page
as he calleth it
wherein he reporteth that i boast my self
rastell
notwithstanding one thing doth sore vex him that i should recite the epistle of
paul whereby he sayeth i would have men believe that i had the spirit of god and think
that though i be young that i see visions and espy the truth
and that my elders have dreamed dreams and wandered in fantasies
this he recounteth to be a great boast &amp; frith that this one place should win him the field
where unto i answer that in dead my words do not prove that thing
which you seem so surely to gather of them
but my words do argue on this manner
that no man ought to condemn a thing before he read it then to give sentence
and because you seem ignorant in the matter i shall declare it unto you
and how it standithe
it is a colour of rhetoric
and is called avantopodosis that is to say an answer to an objection that a man might have here made on this manner
thou grantest thy self young and so small learning dost thou then think that we shall once read or regard thy book
specially sith it is written against ancient men both of great wit and dignity
to this two points i answer preventing their objection that they should not despise it because of my youth
for as the spirit of god is bound to no place
even so is he not addict to any age or person but inspireth where he will and when he will &amp; bring in for an ensample
that he espired young timothe proving there by that the youth of it self is not to be despised
but according to the learning which it bringeth and that
therefore they may not despise my youth but first read
what doctrine i bring and thereafter do judge it
no more in this i proved not that i am inspired and have the spirit of god as timothe had
but only prove that god may inspire youth as he did timothe
and that therefore ye ought first to read before you condemn
for you know not who is inspired &amp; who not until you have read their works or seen their facts
thus you may see that my words define not that all yough is inspired although some may be
but i exhort that no man despise 1 tess
1 prophecies
but prove all and approve that is good
and to make the matter more plain i shall bring you an example of paul to the hebrews which exhorteth hebre
13 them to hospitality
for by that some men onwares have received angels to herber
be not therefore unmindful of it
here paul exhorteth you to hospitality &amp; showing you that by those means some men have received angels into their house
would not have you think that all the gests which he shall receive shall be angels
and not despising my youth because that sometime god inspireth the young
word not have you think that the books made of young men
which ye shall receive
shall be wholesome doctrine
but some men be lewd &amp; unfruitful
nevertheless even as if they received not those gests they should also put away angels
if any came so if you despise to read such books as be written by young men
you may also fortune to dispyce them which are written by the inspirations of christ &apos;s spirit and therefore ye ought to read them
but be it in cause i had in dead praised my self
as i have not
and that i had said that i had the spirit of god
what inconvenience should follow thereof
would you argue that my doctrine were false
if that were a good argument
then were thrystes doctrine false
then were paul a false prophet and our saith nothing for christ said to the jews that he was the light of the world
john
and again he said
it is my father that glorified me whom you call your god
now if it had been a sufficient argument to condemn his doctrine
because the world calleth it boasting than should we have believed no truth at all
besides that paul seemeth not a little to boast him self
11 if men look on it with a carnal yeah
for he sayeth that he thinketh not him self inferior unto the highest apostles
&amp; sayeth again that if they glory to be the ministers of christ
though he speak unwyslye
he is more copious in labours
in stripes above measure
in prison more often
often at the point of death
should we for this words think that his doctrine were not right
nay verily that doth not improve the doctrine
but that it may be good and wholesome for a man may boast himself and do well so he refer the praise to god from
whom all goodness cometh
but be it in case that i should say that god of his mere mercy &amp; for the love that he oweth me in christ
and his blood had given me his spirit that i might be to his laud &amp; praise to whom be thanks for ever
amen
would you think that this were so great abostinge that the doctrine should be impaired thereby
ah blind guides i pray god give you the light of understanding
i beseech you brother rastell be not discontent with me if i ask you one question
be ye a christian man or no
i am sure you will answer yes
then if i brought you the text of paul which sayeth
rome
he that hath not the sprate of god is none of his
i pray you how will you avoid it notwithstanding if you would avoid that text
yet will i say an other block in the way that you shall not be able to remove
and that is the saying of paul
corinth
know ye not your selves that christ is in you
except ye be reprobate persons
now how soever you would judge of your selves
i think verily that i am no such &amp; therefore where as before i did not so write
now i certify you that i am christ &apos;s , conclude what ye will
and the day shall come that you shall surely know that so it is
albeit in mean season i be reputed a laughingstock in this world for i know in whom i trust and he came not deceive me
then bringeth he against me that i rastell say we have been long secluded from the scripture
&amp; also that our fore fathers have not had the light of gods word opened unto them
i marvel what rastell meaneth by frith bringing this for his purpose
for i think it no boasting of my self
but if ye think that it be untrue
i think he is very blind
for what scripture hath the poor commons been admitted unto even till this day
it hath been and locked up in a strange tongue and from them that have attained the knowledge of
that tongue hath it been locked with a thousand false gloss of antichrists making and innumerable laws
and where i say our fore fathers have not had the light of god &apos;s word opened unto them
i mean that they have not the scripture in their own mother tongue
that they might have conferred these juggling mists with the light of god &apos;s word as the process of my words can testify which he hath holy left out
but i beseech the christian reader once to read the place for my discharge and his confusion
ye shall find it in the second leaf of my book
and now he allegeth against me that i should say this
rastell judge christian reader what reasons rastell hath brought and how he hath soluted them
for in my mind both his reasons and solutions are so childish and unsavoury
so unlearned and barren so full of faults and fantasies that i rather pity the man &apos;s deep ignorance &amp; blindness
which hath so deceived him self thorough philosophy and natural reason
then i fear that he by his vain probations should allure any man to consent unto him
i think rastell layeth not this against me
because i boast my self in these words
and verily as touching the truth of those words i will add thus much more unto them
that i never wis man that was counted wise which hath brought so slender reasons except he intended to destroy a thing which ye seem to have build
rastell
and finally where as i exhort all men to judge and confer the scriptures which sir thomas more and my lord of rochestre allege for their opinions
and would have them to ponder their reasons and my solutions unto them annexing these words i am sure that my small learning hath condemned their high eloquence
that my folly hath brought to nought their wisdom and that my youth hath disclosed their festered ignorance
there rastell thinketh that i stand frith well in my own conceit and boast my self above the moan because i touch master more his kinsman
but let rastell take this for an answer
if master more would keep him within his own bonds that is with meddling of worldly matters only
i would never compare with him
yet he must remember that a dawler may correct him in his own craft
but it is even as socrates saith
when a man is wise in one thing then will he take upon him to define all things and be ignorant in nothing and so disdaineth
the gift that he hath and proveth himself onwise
furthermore i see no great praise that i here attribute unto my self
but confess my small learning my folly and my youth
nevertheless if he recount it a praise because i say it hath condemned their high eloquence and their wisdom
and disclosed their ignorance
then let him also annex the words that i wrote saying
and it is even the old practise of god to choose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise
to chose the weak
to confound the mighty
and to choose the vile things which are of no reputation to confound them of high degree
that no flesh might boast it self in his sight to whom only be praise and thanks for ever amen
where all men may see that i refer all praise to him which only is worthy
and so i may conclude that you have not looked indifferently on my book
an answer unto rastell &apos;s second chapter which improveth me for railing and dispraising other
in the second chapter he rangeth rastell the field and searcheth out with all diligens what word i have spoken that might be taken in the worst sense
and calleth them railing jesting and scolding and because he would have me to be abhorred of the reader
he allegeth not only these words that are spoken against himself
but also that are spoken against my lord of rochestre and sir thomas more
not that he intendeth to answer for them or to defend their parties ye may be sure
but only to leave nothing behind which should seem to make for him
like a noble orator the words that he reproveth are these
there rastell taketh his foundation up rastell upon a stark lie
and there he maketh ii lies
and there he maketh iii lies
here i would desire my brother rastell frith to pardon me of a little ignorance
for surely i thought it had been no more offence to call a lie
a lie
them to call a jew a sheep
notwithstanding sith he recounteth it to be railing gesling and scolding
i will here after temper my self
and change my words
and will say that when he lieth
that by his leave
he maketh a fytten
it angreth him when i say that rastell rastell hath lost his wit in purgatory
and therefore i will say so no more
frith but this i will affirm
be rastell never so furious
that who so ever maketh such reasons and solutions
and counteth them good in earnest
that he hath no wit in his heed
where so ever he lost it
but if you would read rastells first argument which i have set in my book in the twelve leaf
then you shall perceive whether i say truth or not
also he allegeth that i should say
that rastell saying of rastell is against scripture
but if he count that railing and would not have me say so much unto him
i will count the man somewhat statlye
and this frith i ensure him that if god suffer me to leave i will say so again
take it as he will
also he reciteth as a great reproach rastell that i should say
i marvel how our scolemen may abide this fellow
and surely the same i say again for frith he proveth both
saint thomas and them also fools and double fools
which if i should so do would be counted heinous heresy
then he rehearseth what i say of master rastell more and my lord of rochestre
and all to help his matter
that when i say the small probations and slender reasons that those ii witted men
sir thomas more and my lord of rochestre had brought to confirm purgatory made my heart to yearn
what railing or jesting this is let frith other men judge
but this i dare avow that i said the truth
for what should a man do or say to see them so contrary in their tales master more saith that their is fire &amp; no water in purgatory
&amp; my lord of rochester saith that their is both fire &amp; water more saith that the minister of punishment are devils
and my lord of rochester sayeth that the minister of punishment are angels
master more sayeth that both the grace and charity of them that lie in pains of purgatory are increased
my lord of rochestre saith the souls of purgatory obtain there neither more
faith nor grace nor charity than they brought in with them
now judge good reader whether i have railed or said the truth
but all this doth rastell leave out full craftily
he reciteth full diligently both the heed &amp; tail
but the middle which expoundeth the matter will he not let you see
he allegeth also against me that i say rastell master more is sore deceived and set on the sand even at the first brunt
and in the beginning of his voyage and that i would wish master more a little more wit
even that i say again and affirm it frith to be true
and is so evidently proved in the beginning of my answer against master more that i need to say nothing
but only refer the reader unto the place
also he improveth me for saying in an rastell other place that master more showeth him in one text twice ignorant and that he is to busy
for he understandeth not the phrase of scripture
this and such other sayings he allegeth frith
which i pass over
for i count it folly to spend paper and labour about the rehearsing of them
for if you read my book you shall see all these points so plainly proved that he mought be ashamed to make mention of them
this he counteth gestinge sclanderinge rastell and railing saying that no reasonable man will think these points to be things belonging to virtue
but rather spices and branches of pride
and that i show not my self therein charitable but rather malicious nor no wisdom therein
but rather folly
adding that if i had been half year at two scoles
that is to say the school of discretion and the school of charity
i should more have prospered in virtuous learning than i have done in other schools this vii year
and sayeth that i have been at the scoles of slandering railing and gestinge
dear brother if it had been so that i frith had spoken certain words in dead which might have seemed in your eyes to be railing
detracting and slandering
as i have not
saving a little jesting
would you disprove my doctrine thereby
what will you then say to s
john baptist which called the pharisees
than heads of the church
as are now our doctors
generation of viperes
would you therefore conclude that his doctrines where nought
i think you be not so childish
and it seemeth this one sentence to be more railing and slandering than all that i have written
what will you say to christ which called the scribes and pharisees hypocrites
he seemeth to rail above measure
where he calleth them hypocrites
and blind guides
painted sepulchres
which onwardlye appear rightwise but within are full of hypocrisy
serpent &apos;s and generation of vipers
besides that he calleth herod fox
he sayeth o unfaithful and overthwart nation
would you think it should excuse the jews which refused his doctrine to say that he railed
and that no reasonable man would think those things to be points belonging to virtue
but rather spices and branches of pride and that he showed not himself charitable
but malicious
nor no wisdom therein but folly
would it excuse them to say
as you do to me
that if he had been one half year at school of discretion and chartye
he should more have prospered in virtuous learning &amp; that he had been at the scoles of slandering
railing &amp; jesting
finally
paul in your eyes might appear to rail &amp; slander &amp; to be clean destitute of god &apos;s spirit
which as luc
saith replenished with the holy ghost said to elemas that resisteth him act
o thou full of all subtlety &amp; deceit thou son of the devil &amp; enemy of all rightwiseness ceaseth not to pervert the rightwayes of the lord
i can bring many such sayings of peter joh
james &amp; judas &amp; yet i think you will not improve their doctrine thereby but because i study to be short
i shall count it sufficient to have warned the reader of this
notwithstanding peradventure rastell will not yet be answered
but will say that albeit i have touched enough as concerning those things that appear railing &amp; slandering in his eyes
yet i brought non that jest as i do
where unto i may answer &amp; allege for me the prophet which both mocked the false priests &amp; gested with them
saying call loud unto your gods for peradventure they are a sleep &amp; can not here
or else they be gone out of town
i can not enough marvel that my brother rastell would use such manner of reasoning with me as to improve my doctrine because of my railing and jesting
for therewith he hath made a foul hole in his kinsman &apos;s best cote for every man perceiveth that m
more his books are so full of railing
jesting &amp; bandy tales
that if the furious momus &amp; venus had take out their parties their should be very little left for vulcanus
after this rastell dissenteth to the purpose rastell of his matter &amp; would prove that my expositions of scripture are not good
because they are an occasion to bring the people to boldness of sin &amp; to move the people to deylte in other men &apos;s faults
and to laughte thereat
and to put you an ensample
he sayeth
if i should take upon me the exposition of this text
and expound it after this manner
in the beginning of this year john frith is a noble clerk he killed a millstone with his spear keep well your geese your dogs do bark
i trow sayeth rastell all wise men would think that this were a fond exposition and yet this exposition would please children fools and mad men
as well as the exposicy on of saint austin or saint hierom or any other doctor of the church
because it would make them to laugh , so
sayeth rastell
frith maketh such expositions with jesting and railing to make the people laugh
not regarding to edify the people
nor to provoke them to virtue meekness or charity nor to leave their sin
but rather giveth than boldness and to believe that their is no purgatory nor hell
but mocketh and jestethe at those reasons that be made for prove of purgatory
now as touching the first part
where frith he sayeth that my expositions be an occasion to bring the people to boldness of sin
i ask him why
his answer is because i give them boldness that there is no purgatory
nor yet hell
thereto rastell by his leave
maketh a fitten
i dare not say he maketh a lie for that he would call railing for i never denied hell
but affirm in many places of my book and even in the first side of mine answer against him i affirm hell
and perpetual damnation
but when ye come to the proof of his words
then you shall see how wisely the man concludeth
men shall think it a good consequent as if i should say that we lack fire in prison
then would he conclude that there lacked fire in all middlesex or if i would say their were no wit in rastell &apos;s heed
then would he conclude that their were no wit in no man &apos;s heed
he hath so long studied philosophy
that he hath clean forgotten his principals of sophistry
notwythstandinge we will forgive him this fault for the man is somewhat aged and therefore i think it is long synes he read them
and that they are now out of his memory
nevertheless he will say that his argument is not saluted for althougth i deny not hell
yet i deny purgatory
and so i give the people an occasion to sin
because they fear not purgatory
where unto i have so sufficiently answered in rastell &apos;s seventh argument that i wonder that he is not a shamed to brengen the same again
but he trusteth that my books shall never be read
and his may go surely abroad
and therefore he may say what he will only he carried not what he sayeth so he hold not his peace
and where he reporteth that i make expositions rastell to make the people to delight to here of other men &apos;s faults and to laugh thereat
thereto will i say nay
till he be at leisure to prove it
&amp; where he sayeth
if he should frith
take upon him to expound
rastell in the beginning of this year john frith is a noble clerk he killed a millstone with his spear keep well your geese your dogs do bark
saying that all wise men would say that this were a found exposition
thereto i answer that
saying
fryth for the time &amp; metre they might well say that a goose had made it for any reason
that is therein
and as touching the meeter
the second verse lacketh a foot
and is shorter than his fellows
but if you put out this word frith
&amp; put in this word rastell for it
then shall his metre also be ꝑfeyte
&amp; that halting verse shall runue merely with his fellows upon his right feet on this manner
in the beginning of this year iohn rastell is a noble clerk he killed a millstone with his spear keep well your geese the dogs do bark thus i have amended his metre
but as for the reason i leave it to him self to amend it at his leisure
in the end of his second chapter he saith that i intend with my expositions to bring the people to believe in iiii other great errors
where of the i is that there is no hell
ordained for any that is of christ &apos;s faith
although he do never so many sins but let us see how he proveth it
an answer to rastell &apos;s iii chap
which would prove that i deny hell
rastell it seemeth
saith rastell
by the reasons that frithe hath alleged that his intent is to bring the people in believe that there is no hell
for i allege in my answer to rastell &apos;s dialogue the saying of
christ chose us in him before the begining of the world that we might be holy &amp; without spot in his sight &amp; again eph
christ loved his congregation &amp; gave himself for it that he might sanctify it in the fountain of water thorough the word to make it without spot or wrinkle or any such thing
but that it should be holy &amp; without blame
and upon these texts i conclude
that if frith
christ have so purged us that we are without spot
wrinkle or bame in his sight
as paul testifieth
then will he never cast us in to purgatory
for what should be purged in them
that are without spot wrinkle or blame
and then somewhat to declare the matter how we be sinners as long as we leave
and yet without sin in the sight of god and add this words why he i would that all men deed well note them and because rastell leaveth out the best of the matter
i will rehearse my own words again
peradventure every man perceiveth not what this meaneth that we are rightwise in his sight
saying that every man is a sinner
therefore i will briefly declare the meaning of the apostle
this is first a clear case that there leaveth no man upon the earth without sin
notwithstanding all they that were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world were laid are without spot of sin in the sight of god
so that they are both sinners and rightwiseyf we consider the imperfection of our faith and charity
if we consider the conflict of the flesh and the spirit
if we consider our rebellious members which are under sin romanorum
then are we grievous sinners
and contrary wise
if we believe that of that merciful favour god gave his most dear son to redeem us from our sin
if we believe that he imputeth not our sins unto us
but that his wrath is pacified in christ and his blood , if we believe that he hath freely given us his christ and with him all things
so that we be destitute of no gift
then are we rightwise in his sight and our conscience at peace with god
not thorough our selves
but thorough our lord jesus christ
so mayst thou perceive that thou art a sinner in thy self
and yet art thou rightwise in christ
for thorough him is not thy sin imputed nor reckoned unto thee
and so are they to whom god imputeth not their sins
blessed rightwise , without spot wrinkle or blame
and therefore will he never thrust them in to purgatory
and for prove of this i allege
as rastell beareth me witness
divers texts of saint paul
ephesians
rastell but that notwithstanding rastell sayeth that i have not recited them sufficiently
for i have left out somewhat which i have rehearsed for the opening of the truth
and than bringeth in that saint paul exhorteth and
we shall use no fornication on cleanness avarice filth or foolish speeches for such shall have no inheritance in the kingdom of heaven
and even so say i to
but judge good reader what is this to the purpose
frith for it neither maketh for purgatory neither against it
this text i could have alleged if i had endeavoured my self that we should do good works
which i never knew christian man deny
but else as touching my matter it is nothing to the purpose and as well he might have improved me
because i bring in no text to prove that the father of heaven is god
or to prove that which never man doubted of
then he allegeth paul
saying rastell though grace do rain thorough christ shall we therefore dwell in sin
nay god forbid saith paul
and even so say i again
that there is no damnation to them which be in christ jesus if they live not after the flesh
and even so say i
but rastell will say the contrary anon
besides that he allegeth roman
we be freely justified by grace
by christ &apos;s redemption to show his justice for the remission of sin done before
and yet saith rastell
paul sayeth that the law is not destroyed by faith but made stable
but this hath frith left out of his book to cause the people to believe that they be clean purged
by the blood of christ only
and that there need no purgatory
by these words you may evidently frith perceive what rastell meaneth by this alleging of paul
for the establishing of the law
verily that the work of the law should justify and clean purge you from sin which is contrary to paul and all scripture
for even in this same chapter that he allegeth paul sayeth
that of works of the law no flesh shall be justified in his sight
and sayeth that the rightwiseness of god cometh by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all that believe
but as touching good works i will touch more hereafter
furthermore rastell sayeth that if my arguments could prove that there is no purgatory
it must follow as well that there is no hell for us that be christen men though we continue still in sin
for if we be blessed without spot wrinkle or blame
&amp; that therefore he will not cast us in to purgatory
then he will not cast us in to hell what soever sin we do commit
here rastell uttereth his blindness unto frith you
and showeth you what understanding he hath in scripture
first he armeth himself with a false supposition and yet there upon he concludeth his argument falsely his supposition is this
that all men which are baptised with material water are very christian men
and have the true faith &amp; be those which paul affirmeth to be without spot blame or wrinkle
but thereto i say nay
for even as the outward circumcision made not the jews the elect people and children of salvation
so doth not the outward baptism make us the faithful members of christ
but as they were the children of god which were inwardly circumcised
even so they that are washed inwardly from the concupiscence of this world are the members of christ
whom paul affirmeth so to be purged thorough his blood
again
you may know that rastell knoweth no nother faith
but that which may stand with all manner of sin
but the faith which we speak of is the same which worketh thorough charity
whereof paul speaketh
they that have this faith are borne of god and sin not
these that have this faith do hope and look daily for deliverance out of this thraldom and body of sin
and in the mean season they purify them self as he is pure
for if a man will say that he knoweth christ or believeth in him and keepeth not his commandments
he is a liar and we renounce him to be any of this member that we speak of
and when rastell sayeth i would conclude there is no hell for them that be christian men though they continue still in sin
i answer he that committeth sin is of the devil
and i say again that the christian that we spoke of which are the children of god can not continue still in sin
but seek all means to fulfil gods commandments
notwythstandinge the christen which rastell speaketh of which are the children of the devil may do as they list
and in dead they had nead to make a friend of rastell to help them in to his purgatory if it be any better than hell
for they shall never come in heaven
except they repent and walk innocently in this world as christ
and his little flock have ever done
for they that walk otherwise are none of his
though they were myteres
this little flock it is that are so purged
and not rastell &apos;s multitude
and for this is there neither hell nor purgatory ordained
even as for this heap that continue still in sin is ordained no heaven
and that there is no hell ordained for these faithful followers of christ
i will prove even by this word of paul that there is no damnation to them that be in christ jesus
if they leave not after the flesh
here rastell hath smite the ball quite under the cord and hath alleged that
that shall condemn him
for if there be no damnation
but because you are somewhat slow in perceiving the matter i shall reduce it in to a sillogismus on this manner
mayor there is no damnation unto them that be in christ jesus if they live not after the flesh
but after the spirit , every hell is damnation ergo their is no hell to them that be in christ jesus
if they live not after the flesh but after the spirit
this is in the first figure made by celarent
not by any profit that i think that the poor commenes can take by such babelinge but only to satisfy your mind and pleasure
notwithstanding one thing i must put you in remembrance
that you have falsely translated the text for the text hath not that conditional all thought i was contented to take it at your hands to see what you could prove
but the text saith thus there &apos;s is no damnation to them that are in christ jesus
which walk after the flesh but after the spirit
where paul doth certify you that they which are in christ jesus
walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
so that you may gather by paul that if they walk not after the spirit they are not in christ jesus
that is to say
they are none of christes
although rastell will call them christian men
therefore dear brethren look that no man deceive him self
for christ is not the minister of sins
if we be delivered from sin thorough christ
them must we walk in a new conversation of our life
or else we are still in darkness
we have this precious treasure in frail
brytell and earthy vessels
let us therefore with fear and trembling work our health
and make stable our vocation &amp; election
for if we retain the truth and knowledge of god
unrightwiseness we shall shortly perceive the wrath of god upon us with infinite delusions
&amp; the end of us shall be worse than the begining
awake therefore &amp; under stand your health
now you may see how he concludeth that i establish this error
that there is no hell for seeing mine arguments
do conclude that there is no hell
nor damnation to them that are in christ jesus
and are his faithful followeres
he thinketh it should well follow that if there be no hell for them
that there is no hell for no man
for in his second chapter and also in the beginning of the third he sayeth that i deny hell
&amp; when we come to his probation
there is nothing said but that which paul confirmeth
that is there is no damnation for them that are in christ jesus
which walk not after the flesh but after the spirit which are thorough christ without spot wrinkle or blame
and so thought rastell appear to him self to conclude like a sage philosopher
yet i answer you he concludeth lick an ignorant sophister as almen may see
for it followeth not
paul and frith say there is no hell
as contrary wise it followeth not there is no heaven for rastells christian men which continue still in sin ergo there is no heaven for the devil their father
and than it is there heaven for christ and his elect
i have before declared how christ &apos;s elect are sinners and no sinners
and now because you should not mistake the texts of s
john which i before alleged i will show you how they do commit sin
which i died also sufficiently touch in my answer against rastell &apos;s dialogue
even ii leaves from the end
and yet i will touch it again
because you shall not think that i would not lead you in ignorance and darkness
there are ii parts in a faithful man which rebel against other and are at continual strife and both of them have divers names in scripture
the one is called the inward man the heart
the mind
the will
and the spirit
the other is called the outward man the rebellious members the body of sin and the flesh
and these in a faithful man keep continual war
and albeit the one be subdued and taken prisoner of the other
yet never consenteth to his enemy
he can not leave him
neither will make peace with him
but will labour what he can and will call for all that he thinketh will help him to be delivered from his enemy
and then warreth upon him a fresh
what time the faithful man is brought to the knowledge of god and believeth in christ and hath his will &amp; mind
renewed with the spirit of god that consenteth to the law of god
that is good righteous &amp; holy and beginneth to love the law and hath a will and a desire to fulfil the law of god &amp; not to despise his heavenly father and look how much he loveth the law counting it rightwise and holy
even so much doth he hate sin which the law forbiddeth and abhorreth it in his heart and inward man
and than albe it the outward man and rebellious members do at time besiege him &amp; take him captive under sin
yet doth not the inward man consent that this sin is good and the law nought
which forbiddeth it
neither do the heart delight in this same sin
neither delight in such sin because the spirit of god testifieth unto him that it is abominable in the sight of god
that he did not that good thing which he would
but the evil which he hated that he did
that is he did not fulfil the good law of god
as his heart will and inward man desired
but did the evil as touching his flesh &amp; outward man
then is it not i that do it but the sin that dwelleth in me
&amp; even likewise the faithful followers of christ commit no sin
for they hate it
and if they fortune to be entangled with sin
it is not they that do it
as paul saith
but the sin that dwelleth in them which god hath left to exercise them as he left the philistines to exercise &amp; nurture the children of israel
&amp; if the remnants of sin fortune at any time to look a loft &amp; begin to rain
but when we be once did
then our members rebel no more
&amp; then needeth neither purpatory nor any other cross for the outward man is turned in to vanity
and our inward man was ever pure thorough believing the word of god
&amp; never consented to sin
&amp; needeth neither purgatory in this world nor in the world to come
but only for subduing the outward man
&amp; therefore after this life he shall never have any purgatory
mark well what i say &amp; read it again
for more shall read it then shall understand it
but he that hath ears let him hear
the second error that rastell layeth to my charge is that i would bring the people in believe that repentance of a man helpeth not for the remission of his sin
in proving this second error against me rastell taketh so great pains that he is almost besides him self
for he saith that i would make men believe that it forsith not
whether they sin or no
why so brother rastell
verily because i allege
ezechiel &amp; hieremye to quench the note fire of purgatory and allege no authorities to prove good works
where unto i answer
as i did before
that it is nothing to my purpose
for the proving of good works doth neither make for purgatory nor against it
i could have alleged all those texts if i had intended my self to prove that i should do good works
which i never knew christen man deny
but as touching my matter it is nothing to the purpose &amp; as well he might have improved me because i bring in no texts to prove that the father of heaven is god
or to prove that which never man doubted of
notwithstanding if rastell had indifferent eyes
i spoke sufficiently of good works in the 34
argument against his dialogue let all men read the place and judge
rastell taketh the matter very grievously rastell that i attempt to allege how s
iohn s
paul send us to christ
and then add that we know no nother to take away sin but only christ
&amp; because i add this word only
therefore he thinketh that i clean destroy repentance where unto i answer frith that i added not this word only
for nought but i did it by the authority of s
iohn which saith
if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with each other &amp; in the blood of jesus christ his son purifieth us from all sin
whereupon i say that for us which are in the light
his blood only is sufficient
but for your christen men which continue still in sin &amp; walk in darkness after their father the devil , must some other meanness be found or else they shall never enter in to the kingdom of heaven
but because i will be short let rastell note that i find ii manner of repentance one is without faith &amp; is such a repentance as judas &amp; rastell &apos;s christian men which continue still in sin
have at the later end which doth rather purchase than an halter then the remission of sins
an other repentance followeth justification &amp; remission of sins &amp; is a flourishing fruit of faith
for when by faith we do perceive the favour &amp; kindness that our loving father hath showed us in his son christ jesus
and that he hath reconciled us unto himself by the blood of his son
then begin we to love him
the more we hate the body of sin &amp; lament and be sorry that our members are so frail
that they can not fulfil the law of god and so in morning and bewailing our infirmity
it causeth us to abstain from both
meat &amp; drink &amp; all worldly pleasures which is the pure fasting that we talk of
but you understand it not
and this repentance cometh not to purge the sins which is committed before
but only taketh an occasion by the sins before committed to know what poison their remained in our flesh &amp; seaketh all means to make us hate this body of sin and to subdue it with all manner of works that god hath appointed to the intent that it should in time to come no more displease god our most merciful father which of gentleness so often pardoneth and forgiveth us
as i have touched before
this is the manner of repentance which i find in scripture
but this helpeth that we should sin no more
but what rastell dremethe i wot not
but to express to the uttermost what i mean by repentance
mark this example if a man build an house which doth cost him much labour and money
&amp; have laid no sure foundation
but that when a tempest cometh his house doth fall
then will he be very sorry
and repent that he hath so foolishly bestowed his money &amp; labour
notwithstanding all this great sorrow and repentance can not set up his house again which is fallen
but only it taketh an occasion by the ruin of the house to teach the owner wit against another time that when he buildeth again he may make a sure foundation
even so thought thou repent never so much that can not get remission for the sins that is passed
but that must be pardoned only by the faith of christ &apos;s blood
nevertheless it doth teach the wit &amp; learn the to tame thy body and subdue it
&amp; cast a low foundation
that in time thou mayst the better resist the assaults of the devil
the world &amp; the flesh
this doth frith teach of repentance
let the world take it as they will
but chyrstes sheep do here his voice
the third error which rastell layeth against me is that i would make men believe that they need to do penance for the satisfaction for their sins
every child may answer him to this if he over read or perceive what i wrote before of repentance
for as they take repentance for the sorrow and morning that followeth the crime
even so they call penance the good works that ensue of repentance
&amp; this good works which follow do mortify the members
&amp; exercise us in god &apos;s commandments that we sin no more
but they can get no more remission of the sin which is once past them that which they call repentance &amp; yet do we neither destroy sorrowing for sin nor good works as he falsely reporteth by us
but we teach you how they ought to be done &amp; that they are fruits of faith
&amp; mortify our members and are profitable to our neighbour
&amp; a testimony unto us that we are children of our heavenly fat
as by example i say that neither the son nor the moan do justify us
or purchase remission of our sins &amp; yet i would not that rastell should say that i deny or destroy the sons the move
for i say it that without that we can have no day
&amp; that we can not be without them
and as touching the solution of this that penance taking in his largest signification
both for good works &amp; taking of pains is not satisfaction for sins
i must tell you once again that there are ii manner of satisfactions
the one is to god
the other to my neighbour
to god can not all the world make satisfaction for one crime
in so much that if every grass of the ground were a man as holy as ever was
paul or peter &amp; should pray to god all their life long for one crime
yet could they not make satisfaction for it
but it is only the blood of christ that hath made full satisfaction unto god
for all such crimes
or else were there no nother remedy
but we should all perish
there is an other satisfaction which is to my neighbour whom i have offended
whom i am bound to pacify as we ii can agree
&amp; as the laws of the realm determine between us
as if i had deformed him
them am i bound to pacify him &amp; to restore him to his good name again
if i have murdered any man then by the laws of the realm i must die for it to pacify my neighbour &amp; the common wealth
but yet i am sure rastell is not so childish as to think that this civil satisfaction is the very satisfaction which pacifieth gods wrath for breaking his law
for if thou murder a man &amp; should die
times for it yet except thou have satisfaction of christ &apos;s blood thou shalt be dampened thereto
and so i spoke that no temporal pain was instituted of god for the intent that we should satisfy gods wrath thereby
as it is plain in my book rastell could see
the fourth error that he layeth against me is that i would persuade the people that good works are nothing available
now are we come to the fourth error where rastell untrue reporteth on me that i would persuade the people that good works done by any man in this world is nothing available unto him that doth them and that it is no hurt nor hindrance unto any man thought he never do none
because i say they justify not before god
therefore he thinketh that other men woide understand me as wisely as he doth
and argue that they are nothing available
but i must desire him to put on his spectacle
and look again upon my book
and he shall find these words
peradventure thou wilt answer unto me
shall i then do good deeds
i answer yes , thou wilt answer me wherefore
i answer thou must do them because god hath commanded them
i answer thou art living in this world with men
and hath conversation with them
therefore hath god appointed the what thou shalt do to the profit of thy neighbour of thy flesh
as paul testifieth
we are his work in christ jesus
unto good works
which works god hath prepared that we should walk in them
these works god would have us do that the unfaithful might see the godly and vertuose conversation of his faithful and thereby be compelled to glorify our father which is in heaven
and so are they both profitable unto thy neighbour and also a testimony unto the by the which a man may know that thou art the right son of they heavenly father and a very christ unto thy neighbour
&amp; after teacheth that we ought to do these works without having respect either to heaven or hell
but attending thorough charity the wealth of our neighbour etc i wonder , that rastell is not ashamed to say that i would make them believe that they are not available
therefore good reader note my words
first i say we must do them because god hath commanded them
is it not available to keep the commandments of god
secondarily i say that they are to the perfit of my neighbour
is it not available
thirdly i say that they tame our flesh
is it not available
fourthly i say they are to the glory of god is it not available
fifthly i say they are a testimony to them that doth them by the which men may know that he is the very son of god
is that not awaylable
belike rastell counteth nothing available but that which iustyfieth before god
he will say the son is not available because it justifieth not
fire is not available in his eyes because it justfieth not
then rastell saith that i make a wonders work with the scripture
and allegeth certain texts that we ought to do good works
which i never denied
&amp; thereupon would conclude that works save &amp; justify
&amp; playeth me the ball lustly over the cord
but as god would there stood a post right in the way &amp; he hit it so full
that it made the ball to rebound over again backward
for in the alleging of his purpose paul sayeth eph
he hath clean lost the game
the words are these
by grace you be saved by your faith &amp; that is not of you
it is the gift of god and not of works that no man should glorify him self
we are the works created of god in christ jesus which god hath prepared that we should walk in them
here because he would have the latter end of the text to serve for his purpose which teacheth good works
which i never denied
he bringeth in that thing which clean confuteth his opinion for his opinion which in all places he hath laboured to prove
is that we are saved by good works
but now mark what he allegeth out of paul by grace you be saved by your faith
&amp; that is not of you
it is the gift of god &amp; not of works
for that no man should glorify him self
here paul saith plainly that our salvation is not of works
&amp; so hath rastell cast done that he built before
&amp; may be likened to a shroud cow
which when she hath given a large mess of milk turneth it done with her heel
thus have i answered to as much of rastell &apos;s treatise as i could get
if there be any more which may come to my hands
i shall do my diligence to disclose his disobeyed so that god give me leave to keep the court with him he shall win but little
except he convey his balls more craftily
and yet the truth to say we play not on even hand
for i am in a manner as a man bound to a post
&amp; can not so well bestow me in my play
as if i were at liberty
for i may not have such books as are necessary for me
neither yet pen
ink
paper
but only secretly
so that i am in continual fear
both of the lieutenant &amp; of my keeper
lest they should espy any such thing by me
&amp; therefore it is little marvel though the work be on ꝑfeyte
for when soever i here the keys ring at the door
straight all must be conveyed out of the way
and then if any notable thing had been in my mind
it was clean lost
&amp; therefore i beseech the good reader count it as a thing borne out of season
which for many causes can not have his form &amp; shape
&amp; pardon me my rudeness &amp; imperfection

the friar &apos;s chronicle
or
the true legend of priests and monks lives
to the right honourable the countess of devonshire
with all her other well-deserving virtvus
right honourable
although such ladies as your self
are either compared to rich caskets
containing within them more richer jewels
or resembled to precious diamonds
made the more glorious by enamelling
and the cunning of the workman
yet , i protest
being an eyewitness of your constant resort unto wisdom &apos;s feast
and apprehensive
that you love religion merely for god &apos;s love
that alone hath incited me to select you the patroness of this discourse
whereby
i make no doubt
you shall not only run with zacheus to the top of a figtree to behold jesus
but be glad in your very soul
that your footsteps are fixed in the way of salvation
and that you are now going on in the path
that will conduct you to new jerusalem
the work it self is the discovery of the unswept corners of popish monasteries
the instrument wherewith it is done
though it be not the prophet &apos;s lantern and candle to search the great city
yet it is the opening of a book
wherein you may read such loathsome particulars against papistry
that in your friend &apos;s behalf
you will do
as we were wont to do in england
even spit at the naming of the devil
and in your own
lift up your hands to heaven with thanksgiving
that god hath blessed you with a better knowledge
the author
is i confess
no divine
but a penitent sinner
and one that would fain strive to be a doorkeeper in the house of god
who hath taken this mercy upon him
to welcome him home with better acates
then to feed with the hogs at the troughs
my name you shall sure find at the last
which if it carry an unpleasant accent
oh be thus honourable
to admit of one good quality
as the mirror of his time sir philip sidney was wont to say
for a great many have none
and no man hath all
your honours humbly devoted
the friar &apos;s chronicle or the true legend of priests and monks lives
i make no question
but that true and well written discourse of the anatomy of the english nunnery at lisbon in portugal
hath not only had a gracious acceptation with you
but wrought upon your judgements and understanding
as far as the abhorring their impieties
and lamenting the seduction of silly ignorants
who i dare affirm
being brought out into the sunny splendour of truth and discovery
would either wonder
where and how they have been so long detained in darkness
or make sport at such ridiculous absurdities
as they have been befooled withal
but because there remains much more to be spoken out of other relations
and undeniable verity
to make the pride of babel loathsome to true christian souls
and the impieties of that man of sin abhorred of all judicious and understanding men
i have here under-taken further searches for the good of all truehearted protestants indeed
and although i have no such portion allotted
as with the prophet &apos;s lantern and candle to search the unswept corners of jerusalem
or with christ &apos;s rod of cords to whip the buyers and sellers out of the temple
yet i hope i shall have strength enough to wrestle down the strumpet
and lay her flat on her back to the hissing of the passengers
for all the painting of jezabel
and adorning of her head to seem more majestical to jehu
she was yet at the last thrown out of the window
and dashed against the ground
so shall babylon that great city beserued
in the end she shall be set on fire
and the merchants of the earth shall howl at her desolation
amazed afar off at her falling to rubbish
and beholding her smoke to ascend
like the smoke of a furnace
wherein that you may see the reason of god &apos;s indignation
and whereby you may entertain certain motives for your own conversion
or establishment
i have here taken upon me to discover
how the popish clergy left and forsook the pure waters of siloa
to drink the puddled streams of traditions and filthiness
scorned to quench their thirst
and buy milk and food without money
but would needs with simon magus pay dear for spiritual gifts
and in a word
denied to come to wisdom &apos;s feast
because they would run a whoring after their own inventions
and feed their sensual carcases with the banquet and acates of their own desires
and devising
at first i determined no method
or division
supposing that the spreading of instances &amp; examples would have afforded sufficient contentment to the reader for the subject in hand
which is the detection of sundry foul abuses in popery
or if you will
in the lives of priests and friars
but finding the stream to come down with a main current
and that the stopping or damning it up too close
would overflow the fields
and spoil much good ground
i thought it better to cut out certain rivulets
and passages
wherein the river might run between bounded banks
and so the lookers on receive both pleasure and profit in the handsome keeping their channels
for which purpose if you run about the stream
you shall find out certain deceitful nooks
holes
creeks
and dangerous flats or shelves
first
of lying miracles
secondly
cozening devices
thirdly
whoredom
fourthly
epicurism
fiftly
thefts and robberies

eighthly
gross ignorance
ninthly

eleventh
impieties
and 12
simony
of all which in order
or as orderly as i can
not that i place them in their seats of precedency
or tie them to any coherence of depending one upon another
but to show you with what palpable grossness they proceeded to overthrow true religion
and justified themselves in the world
to countenance their wickedness
though they were never so foul delinquents
i leave to dispute of their doctrines
school-questions
fundamental controversies
church-ceremonies
the pope &apos;s supremacy
and many other tedious disceptations
which have clogged us with heavy burdens
and filled libraries with thousands of volumes
and only at this time with elias gather up my clothes for a cursory journey
and take my staff in my hand
to go the more speedier forward
and as i confess
i must pass over much ground unseen
and unmarked
so i beseech you
gentle reader
censure me in the same manner
and excuse my not fully satisfying of you
by reason of the hastiness of my journey
and the small time i allot my self for the dispatch of my business
only herein i dare be confident
there is not a step i make
but i have warrant for my footing
nor story i relate
but is extracted out of the books of their own magazines
and authority of their former writers
and so i conclude this preface with the poet
the daughter of wonder
i will be bold to say
he that writ their golden legend
was the father of lies
but because there are so many books
and so many discoveries concerning their ridiculous stories
insomuch that the papists themselves have been ashamed of such palpable grossness
and ridiculous absurdity
i will insist the lesser on this point
and so leave you to the lives of their saints

whereupon to exprobrate their folly

he answered the image in this sporting manner
peace
madam
it is not lawful for women to speak in the church
at strasborough a certain superstitious old woman resorted much to our lady with sufficient offertories
which when the priests perceived
to countenance her devotion
they caused the child to speak &amp; thank her in our lady &apos;s arms
which made the woman look strangely
and speak somewhat angrily
for she presently replied
peace young gentleman
i have nothing to do with you
let me hear what my good lady your mother says
a tailor of florence
worshipping saint john in the church of saint michael barteldi
kneeling down
began in this manner
o glorious and blessed saint john
tell me
i pray thee
whether my wife have played false
and what shall become of my son
which the priests and clerk hearing
lying in wait for such purposes
either to make sport
or to raise a further profit
made saint john thus reply
my dear son
go in peace
and to morrow thou shalt receive an answer
the tailor
i hope
missed not his hour
nor forgot his offertory
so he made his petition
&amp; the image answered
thy wife hath made thee cuckold
and thy son shall be hanged
at which the fellow was so amazed
that he went home enraged
and wanted little of desperately making away himself through the villainy of the priests
this tale did piero de cosmo de medici
relate himself to diverse of his guests
a priest of louvain
called anthony
having solemnly invited some merry companions to dinner
knew not yet which way to entertain them
for he had neither meat nor money
at last stepping into a neighbour &apos;s house
where he was very frequent
and finding the servant absent
he took the pot from the fire
and carried it home under his gown
thus he not only supplied his wants
but pouring out the meat into some other dish
sent the pot handsomely made clean
as a pawn to the owner
and borrowed money of it
having a bill of sale for the receipt
the good man in the mean while chase and fretting for the loss of his dinner
and theft of his pot
knew not what to say
till the maid assured him
there was none there but sir anthony
he again loath to accuse so reverend a man
and indeed afraid of the danger
was more vexed then before
till the servant looking on the pawn
told him
it was his own pot
then out of all patience he accused the priest before a magistrate
but when sir anthony showed the bill of sale
it was turned to a merriment
and so the theft was shuffled over
the jacobinas of berne
and franciscans of orleans got most of their wealth by walking spirits
and resorting by night to houses
as if robin goodfellow had done the drudgery to ease the servants of their labour
friar reynald of sienna
loving a man &apos;s wife
and so resorting to the house
was overtaken on a sudden with the unlooked for coming home of her husband
and had scarce time to leap out of the bed
and carry his clothes in his hand
the man knocking still
and the wife making no great haste
some hurly-burly arose
whereupon
the woman lays the child in the friar &apos;s place
and lets in her husband
who angrily demanded
why she tarried so long
oh replied she
speaking so loud
the friar might hear her
our son had like to have perished through a fit of the colic
so that i was fain to send for friar reynald to pray for him
who bade me keep him warm in the bed
and is himself with his sexton at his devotion in the loft
with that
the friar and his companion came down with a book in his hand
and after solemn curtsy made
told the good man
the child had certain worms in his maw
and therefore he must make a statue of wax of his bigness
and present it to saint ambrose
the curate of ouziane
near to amboise
having long had the pleasure of his hostess
and bred a great deal of jealousy in her husband
thought by a crafty trick to remove that humour
pretending to be gelt
whereupon he agrees with one peier de serpens
borne at villantroies in berry
for four crowns to sport with him
and conceal the matter
which when the host understood
he promiseth him twice as much to perform the thing indeed
the surgeon taking pity of the man
and despited at the friar &apos;s knavery
bound him hand and foot
and while he looked the company should make intercession for him
and so leave him to his former liberty
the other whipped off his stones
telling him plainly
his profession was no dallying profession
and so the host seemed quieted
as being thus revenged
a woman in orleans being in love with a young scholar
who yet was not acquainted with her
knew no better way to discover her affection
then by her friar confessor
desiring him to give him good counsel
not to tempt her
nor solicit her any more
especially not to come over the wall into her orchard as he promised
the friar overtaken with her simplicity
advised the young man for the best
and to divert his love from her
the young man again knowing there was no such matter
and yet apprehensive of a woman &apos;s wit
admitted of his good instruction
but instructed himself how he nowmight enjoy a sweetheart
but when the friar understood how he had been made a bawd and pander for the business
he thought to beat out one nail with another
and so very knavishly threatened the discovery
if he might not share in the bargain
it is reported of oliver mailard
that when he saw the wickedness and villainy of priests and friars
he wondered
that the saints interred in the church
did not rise and pull out the eyes of the whoremasters
and deceivers
pontanus saith
that there were certain nunneries at valencia
which by reason of the filthiness of friars
who played the very bawds and panders to get money
became loathsome stews
and entertained young gentlemen
as in brothel houses
but all under colour of devotion
when any of the priest &apos;s knavery was discovered
there were excuses enough ready to descend them
yea
when they were found kissing of a woman
the answer was
you must suppose he did it to print a blessing on her lips
what should i name the great abuses of indulgences
and pardons
and all for money
wherein there were many tricks
and counterfeit devices
certain cheating friars having pawned their relics in a tavern
and wanting money to redeem them
showed the people a firebrand
and made them believe it was part of the fire
which broiled saint laurence
whereupon according to the ignorance of those times
many gave them money
which they spent in all unthriftiness
a lady sent to pleasure a young cardinal
according to a certain composition between him and her husband
seemed at first very coy
and for all the baseness of her husband
would by no means consent to his pleasure
till at last
by forcible persuasions
fair entreaty
extraordinary promises
the handsomeness of his person
and the greatness of his estate
she condescended unto him
and seemed well pleased in the alteration
whereupon she returns to her husband with the money
and told him plainly
she was bought and sold
and therefore would return
and forsake him for ever
and thus much of their cozening and devices
wherein i pray you take only this notice
that i mean to give you but a taste of every one of the divisions
for if i should set a banquet before you
or a feast to feed you
you would rather surfeit
then be satisfied
the dishes are so many wherewith i could furnish the table
and of that variety
that you might rather glut and gorge your selves
then content nature with a temperate diet
again
whereas it may be objected
these were the times of old
there is now great reformation since these enormities were looked into
i answer plainly and directly
the same superstition remains at this hour
and the priests do so prevail with cozening deceit
and far-fetched devices
that in spain this present year 1622
the doctrine of the conception of our lady without sin
and assumption into heaven
is newly divulged and ratified
and the contrary opinion reputed heresy
and the repugners hunted
and hissed at in every town and city
concerning their whoredom
or if you will have the cleanlier term
fornication
who knows not
that there is a common allowance of stews
more than a conveniency
under all the catholic government
for which the women do allow an annual entrado into the pope &apos;s exchequer
or to the several states where they live
in the first council of toledo
in the reign of arcadius and honorius
it was agreed
that the clergy living without wives
should have concubines
in the patents of abbots
in the realm of england
this clause was inserted
in those days it was counted good policy to have a wife
daughter or niece
a companion of a cardinal
or bishop
to befriend the kindred in matters of complaint
or in trials of law
a gentlewoman taken in adultery
and so divorced
desired for her penance to be detruded into a monastery
alleging this reason to her inward friends
that in stead of punishment
she should be sure to have there the greater pleasure
when soldiers entered into any town to be lodged
or quartered
the first thing they did
was to hunt after priests lemons
and search every corner for their whores
and thus much for the general
now to particulars
a franciscan friar lodging in the house of a gentleman of perigot
found the means to lie with his wife upon her purification
as understanding by confession his resolution
so he entered the chamber first
and when he had taken his pleasure
departed out of the house
excusing his haste to the porter
by special business
after he was departed
comes the gentleman indeed
and found by his wife &apos;s speech
that some body had wronged him
which so amazed him
that he amazed her by saying
he was abused
she with tears assured him
that none was in the house but the friar
and her brother
which was no sooner spoken
but up he gets
and to the porter he comes
and there understands
how the friar was departed
after him he follows
but not overtaking him
he returns home again
in his absence
the wife enraged to be so deflowered
hangs her self
and in the mischance overthrew a little child dead to the ground
the noise raised the house
and at last comes the brother
and finding his sister hanged
supposing her husband had done it
in some fit of jealousy
out of doors he flings
and meets him returning home
in which mood he sets upon him with villain
and defiance
and so they wound one another to death
the franciscans of strasborough
before they were expelled
accustomed to steal away men &apos;s wives
and keep them cloistered like young novices
cutting their hair
and charming them with fear of death
till at last a butcher &apos;s wife was sent in the same habit with the cater to buy meat of her husband
who eyeing her very narrowly
as having seen the face before
could not be restrained
but laid hands upon her
and so after great ado
all was discovered
&amp; the friars banished
two franciscans having no money to pay the ferry
ravished the woman that carried them
and so pleased her
a franciscan in perigot found the mean
by obscuring himself in the bride-chamber
to lie with a bride
before her husband came to her
and escaped
for all that the household could do
when they heard of it
another franciscan by lions
married his brother friar
in the habit of a scholar
to a widow &apos;s daughter of great riches and account
making them believe
he was an heir to great revenues
and sent to lions
as it were under his tutelage
but at last the mother and daughter coming to hear mass
as much devoted to this order
espied her husband answering the priest in his friar &apos;s weed
which for the time they concealed
till they came home
and at night
as his custom was
he likewise kept his hours
but being in bed
the mother comes in
and laid hold of his hands
while his daughter pulled off his cap
and discovered her shaved crown
and so he was apprehended
and sent to the magistrate
there are more stories of the franciscans
then of any other order
&amp; they were evermore played upon
because they pretended more holiness
and sanctity of life
they builded their houses and cells very near the nunneries
insomuch that many merrily said
here were the barns
it is reported
that when henry the second was king of france
and wanted a great sum of money
a certain lord wished him to sell the friar &apos;s beds
and when the king demanded
where they than should lie
he presently replied
with the nuns
but
quoth the king
there are more monks a great deal then nuns
why
said the other
one nun may very well have five or six monks
two or three curates between dauphin and savoy
persuaded the women to feign themselves mad
that while their husbands went on pilgrimage to recover their health
the priests might come and lie with them
a friar minorite of sicilia
falling in love with the young wife of old agatha the physician
taught her a trick to feign her self pained with the disease of the mother
for which the friar must be sent for
and bring in the relics of saint bernardine
which he did
commanding all the company in the chamber to avoid
and so he went to bed to the physicians wife
while his companion lay with the maid
but ere all was done
home comes the old man
and found the friar &apos;s breeches under his wife &apos;s pillow
which she confessed
as a part of the relics
there to remain
for fear of a relapse
whereupon the maid went to the friars
to tell what had chanced
who came down merrily with all the other ceremonies of the cure
and so put his breeches together with the other relics
the old tale of the abbess in lombardy is remembered to this day
who hearing that one of her nuns was in labour
came in all haste to chide her
but belike she was puzzled in the dark
for in stead of her veil
she had put on a monks breeches
that lay with her the same night
so coming to the nun
she began to revile her
who for all her pain
soberly answered
good madam mend your plaster
and all shall be well enough
i warrant you
this tale is seconded by many other stories in mine author
pogius the florentine reports of an hermit at padua
in the time of francis the
duke who was accused for enticing the young and handsome women to his lust and pleasure
whereupon the duke &apos;s secretary was very busy to examine him
hoping he would name some
at whose husbands he might make sport
and laughter
in which jollity
he urgeth him again and again to set down the women
why then
quoth the hermit
and you be so hasty
write down your own wife first
i hope you may imagine he was amazed
the duke smiled
and the whole company stood silent
for fear their turn should be next
a priest at paris
after shrift went no further than the pew he sat in
to satisfy his lust
a curate near vienne in dauphin
went behind the high altar
a woman taken in adultery with a priest
was accused and examined
but because she could not deny the fact
the priest was brought before the bishop
who prescribed him this penance
not to come in three months within a church
when the man
who was thus abused
understood of so small a punishment
he lies in wait for him
and cruelly beats him
so that he is brought before his judge to receive punishment
who awarded him not to come into a tavern in 3
months
at which the bishop seemed much offended
till the judge answered
my lord
considering the first abuse
i hope it is as great a punishment for him not to visit a tavern
as penance for the priest not to trouble a church
in a village near corguac
called cherues
a maid was got with child by her own brother
which she discovered to a priest
and he persuaded the people impragnatam à spiritu
but when so great an imposture came to the ears of the earl of angolesme
father to francis the first
he quickly found out the deceit
and so they were both burnt
and the priest suspended
to conclude this section
i will be bold with the records of the time of henry the eight in our own country
concerning the visitation of monasteries
covents
collegiate churches
and other religious houses
out of which these particulars are extracted
that in the monastery of battle
or beat
in the diocese of chichester
these so domites were discovered
and john austin
in the church of canterbury among the monks of saint bennet
all these were found sodomites
and punished accordingly
to name other places
and other commissions of whoredom and fornication
were infinite
but so it was
and will be in all nations
where impurity and superstition overcomes true zeal and devotion
yet because there were certain religious men that did observe state in their impiety
and thought scorn to go to common brothels
or prostituted whores
but kept women by the name of sequestration
and so lived more glorious
than the rest of poorer priests
i will also name you some of them
as among the monks of saint bennet
christopher james had the command and use of three married women
william
abbot of bristol had four whores
in windsor castle
nich
whyden
priest
had but four
george witborne had five
richard hunn five
robert danison
six
richard prior of maiden-bedly
five
in the monastery of shulberd
in the diocese of chichester
george walden
prior
had seven
john standney
seven
nicholas duke
five
in the monastery of bath
richard lincombe had seven
in the cathedral church of chichester
john hill had only thirteen
john white prior of bermonsdy had twenty
now if there were four hundred covents of monks
and nuns
and two hundred of begging friars
and a survey taken of all the delinquents in this kind
o judge
for god &apos;s sake judge
how many whores
and bastards of priests
and friars might be in england in those days
and then
if according to the poet
we could step into france
italy
spain
germany
and other countries
where the clergy bore the sway
and gave the example
and so pull out the dust and rubbish of their unswept corners
oh what a deal of filth
and a dunghill of noisomeness
would arise
and what a mountain of sin would this sin make
as for the distinction of time
i will be bold to say
it is as ill now
as ever it was in any time
find fault with the priests
not only for their hypocrisy
but their filthy and incontinent lives
given to gluttony and belly-cheer
which he setteth out by the terms of drunkenness and vomiting
i hope
the monks and friars of europe come behind none of them all
oh look
for god &apos;s sake
look
and you shall find in the book of god
many invectives against corrupt priests
covetous priests
winking priests
negligent priests
obstinate priests
idolatrous priests
rebellious priests
indifferent priests
gluttonous priests
blind priests
ignorant priests
dumb priests
courtly priests
idle &amp; unconstant priests
bribed priests
hypocritical priests
devilish priests
devouring priests
raging priests
incredulous priests
flattering priests
bloody priests
murchering priests
lukewarm priests
mad priests
oh look for god &apos;s sake
look
and you shall find in the cloisters of monasteries
in the cells of abbeys
in the walks of religious places
in the courts of princes
in the castles of lords
in the houses of gentlemen
in the streets of cities
in the farms of countrymen
and in the chambers of widows
religious men of all these sorts
especially hunting after belly-cheer
and to fill their veins with fullness of blood
hot
and corrupted
mark but the situation of their monasteries and houses
are they not in the fattest grounds
and the plentiful fields of the country
do they not feed on the choicest lambs of the fold
and stretch out their limbs on beds of ivory
do they not carouse in goblets and chalices of gold
and have the purest wines of the vintage
with what delicate fruits are their orchards stored
and with what walks of pleasure are their gardens contrived
was it not a byword in those days
a chuffing abbot
a fiery-faced abbot
a gorbellied abbot
is there not at this hour bread made at paris of the finest wheat
called the chapter bread
do they not every where feed on the daintiest manchet
yea
those they call mendicant friars
eceive no scraps
i hope
but whole loaves
and the best provision in an house
are not their cators sent to the markets to provide the best meat
both flesh
fish
&amp; fowl
pikes of five french crowns
carp
tenches
barbels
and all of that sort at high rates
and must they not be sod and stewed in wine
to please the palate
and heat the stomach
are not their fasting days
days of banquets
sweetmeats
and confectionary stuff
culliss and broths
cawdles
and panados
sweet and hot waters
perfumes and incense
are not their linen of the best diaper and damask
and the utensils of their house so far from temperature
and moderation
that they exceed in sumptuousness
and bravery
there was a certain cardinal in rome
that
to make demonstration of humility
had always a net for his tablecloth
but preferred to the papacy
he bade take away the net
for he had that which he fished for
when english cromwell had a great suit to clement the pope
he acquainted himself with his custom
and diet
and so invented a dish of savoury and pleasant jelly
which he brought in
in a fantastical manner
with a true man &apos;s song
a thing much in use in those days
and so whether his holiness were pleased with the sport
or delighted with the dainty
he granted his request
pope julius accustomed to eat pork and peacock &apos;s flesh
would make long meals
and was a mere glutton
becket himself was accused for an heretic
as eating capons on saint marks day
and feeding like an epicure on prohibited times
so that he should have been attached
had not the holy man miraculously turned a capon to a carp
in the legend of cardinal wolsey
it is objected against him
that he ate stewed capons in lent
and sat at his feasts as long as the king himself
i could name the rest
or at least many more
but these
i hope
shall suffice for the subject in hand
and if any have forgot the usance of their own country
let them still demand of the travellers in other places
who have frequented the monasteries of europe
and i hope they will confess the truth without blushing
thefts and robberies
but the exhausting of the treasure of a whole kingdom
insomuch
that for such thievish exaction
luther and others rolled a stone
which never jest
till it turned the pope &apos;s supremacy out of most countries of europe
was not the imposition of peter-pences in england
amounting to the yearly rent of a 100000
pound sterling
a mere theft
did not women go about
as they do still in ireland
with a cozening priest
to howl over the graves of the dead
and mourn for the desunct
teaching their eyes to weep
and their hearts to sob
and all for money
are not the priests still set on work to encroach upon the flexible nature of men and women
to persuade them to wilful poverty
that they might be enriched with their gifts and legacies
and have their monasteries augmented with their lands and revenues
were not the jesuits banished venice
for cozening the ladies and gentlewomen of their collanas&apos;
and jewels
some of them worth two thousand pound sterling
being of great oriental pearl
and other rich precious stones
what an infinite treasure did cardinal wolsey convey out of this realm
for the ransom of pope clement
and bribery of the cardinals for his own advancement to the papacy
and maintaining his ambition
is not that ridiculous tale worth the reciting
of the man that buried his dog
for which he was accused
and brought before the bishop
which he answered in this manner
o my lord
if you knew the wisdom of this dog
you would not condemn me
for at his death he bequeathed a legacy to your lordship of a hundred crowns
knowing your wants
and great occasions
by which excuse he was remitted
and the bishop pacified
but was not this either manifest atheism
or plain robbery
was and is not the crusade a trick of thievery
to make men believe
they must pay so much money
or be damned
did not a ghostly father preach in the open pulpit
that when any money was given for a soul departed
the souls in purgatory hearing it tingle in the basin
did laugh for joy
was not this the very cause
that christ did exprobate the pharisees for buying and selling in the temple
saying plainly
this should be a house of prayer
but ye have made it a den of thieves
at casal one finding three hundred crowns
confessed the same to a priest
who so terrified him with damnation
if it were not restored
that the silly fellow delivered him the money to impart it back again to the owner
as he by conjuration would find out
but he deceived him
and spent the same amongst whores
and pot-companions
a courtesan in venice lying very sick
sent for a friar to confess her sins
and so opening a casket
in which was our lady &apos;s psalter bound in gold
the friar peeping in
saw beside a 1000 zhekinos lying by
for the time he said little
but afterward found a better time to purloin the same away
was not the hermit of the valley of monte negro a jolly fellow
who with two friars kept the passages in strange habits
and robbed all comers
did not certain priests frequent the scholar &apos;s lodgings at sienna
and still as their exhibition came from their parents
they would either steal some
or be the cause of unnecessary expenses
and when money failed
they would either have books
or apparel
at the garden of simples in padua
a gentleman of poland having a rich hatband
was deceived of it by a friar
that came and lay by him
as he was searching the ground for some new herb to show the master
i could name you a thousand of these stories
both to prove their general and particular thefts
some serious
some ridiculous
some indifferent
but these shall suffice at this instant
and i make no question
there is no reader
or searcher of inuentories
but lights upon many more
and although some with lycurgus law allow of theft
to make men the more wary and cautelous of their goods
and othersome excuse them
as men subject to imperfections
or politic husbands
that may increase their estates by thriving devices
yet the truehearted christian will confess such theeveries
the branches of impiety
and if they condemn them in other men
will much more abhor them in the professors of religion
and priests of the clergy
concerning their murders
and cruel and bloody practices
either to compass their own 6
murder
and bloody cruelty
ends
or take revenge of such as had offended them
i am thus freighted with many stories
but before i come to particulars
give me leave to tell you
i could discover many horrible and fearful executions
many notorious and formidable massacres
many grievous and sanguinarious persecutions
i could tell you
that the priests persuaded silly women
that abortion was no sin
i could also add
that in the gardens of nunneries
was always a tree or two of savine
which they say the nuns used to drink steeped in wine
now the property of savine is to destroy any thing condensed in the womb
and so you may judge of the cause
and so i come to the rest
in the time of maximilian the emperor
a franciscan friar in flanders
came one night into a gentleman &apos;s house
and after he had murdered some servants
took the gentlewoman perforce
and dis-robed her of her apparel
putting a short garment on her
which he brought with him
of purpose to steal her away to the monastery
and so threatening her with death
if she spoke or discovered the matter
though she met with her husband
hurried her out of doors
riding with a long pike staff
and a short dagger disguised
but as he posted away in this manner
he met with her husband indeed and his man
the gentlewoman
as she was threatened and conjured
passed by
and durst not speak
and so the friar followed as churlishly
the servant had only a glimpse of her
and knew her
yea
he discovered the friar also
telling his master
what had happened
but he by reason of the impossibility of the matter
as he supposed
told him he was a fool
or mad
and so would have rid home without any more ado
but the servant would needs go back again to take his better view
which when the friar perceived
and apprehensive
that his knavery should be revealed
he took the advantage of the man &apos;s peering under her veil
&amp; so with a violent stroke
field him to the ground with his brains dashed out
the gentleman seeing his man fall
returned in fury
and had the fortune to close with the friar
and so struggling together
at last overthrew him
which when his wife perceived
she returned and assisted him
wounding the friar with his own dagger
thus was he taken
and afterward examined
and adjudged to dye
and so he was publicly burnt
the lord saint john of ligoures
cousin to the marshal of saint andrew &apos;s
committed incest with his wife &apos;s mother
and had diverse children by her
yea
he so loved her
or if you will
burned in lust toward her
that he revealed the same in confession to his ghostly father
who to pleasure the lord
told him plainly he might kill his wife
and so be rid of her
this was dangerous and bloody
and thereupon he made a stay
till the friar andaciously told him
he would be the executioner for his sake
and so the murder was committed by certain ruffians
but at last detected
for which the friar was publicly executed
a priest of fonsigney
called don john
under the dominion of thiez
than governor of geneva
out of mere malice and heartburning
boted out his brother &apos;s eyes
not so contented
he brought him to chambery
to a saint called saint ivory
and then in great request
and as he was passing over a bridge
would have thrown him into the river
but missing of his purpose
by access of greater company
he with certain as wicked as himself
killed him in a barn
a priest called saint john
came to autuns &apos; church in paris
to visit the curate of saint andrew des ars
who stood between him
and a benefice
but not willing to tarry the time
and growing enraged to be so long disappointed
he took an opportunity
and set upon him and his man
and with his companions killed them both
for which he was afterward executed
in an inn at soysons
the good man &apos;s daughter of the house had a child unlawfully
which was brought up in the house to his great grief
and therefore he could never endure it
because it still put him in mind of her shame
at last he contrived to put her to a nunnery with a certain piece of money
and so he bargained with a priest called hector
a baker &apos;s son of moyen
but this varlet took the child
and without any more ado cut her throat
throwing the body into a heap of nettles
but see the goodness of god hard by
was a sexton making a grave in a churchyard
to whom he proffered money to bury the body
but he suspicious of the murder
revealed all he knew to the magistrate
and so the parties were examined
and the murder found out
a priest of orleans jealous of a whore which he kept
and loath to be further tormented
carried her to a tavern
under colour of kindness
and there beginning cause of displeasure
at last cut her throat
the duke of brabant
and earl of gelderland
raised war for the dukedom of limbourg
in which the bishop of cullen as assistant to the earl
was taken prisoner
and kept seven year
till all conditions were accomplished
thus was he in the custody of the earl of mount in heinalt
whom he could not corrupt for his escape with any promise or gifts
which so enraged him
that in his heart he swore revenge
at last he is set at liberty
and all unkindness seemed to be forgotten
insomuch that the bishop came to visit the duke
&amp; in his return entreated the earl to accompany him to tuits
a town standing over against cullen
which he did
suspecting no harm
but the bishop had lived in ambuscado for him
and not only imprisoned him
but every hot day used him in this manner
he script him naked
and most cruelly put him into an iron cage
all anointed over with honey
and so set him in the sun
where flies
hornets
wasps
and bees
tormented the poor earl to death
two canons of cullen upon displeasure against herman grin
and yet dissembling their malice
invited him to dinner
and in stead of friendly fare
thrust him into a room
where was kept a hungry lion
but the valiant man winding his cloak about his arm
drew his rapier
&amp; killed the beast
and so scaped the revenge of these wicked priests
henry
archbishop of cullen
most cruelly and barbarously broke the arms and legs of earl frederick
and when he had done
cast the carcase to the crows
in the time of otho the emperor
there was a cruel bishop of mentz
who hated the poor
and said they were worse than vermin
and rats
and fit for nothing but to be burnt
whereupon in a time of dearth he filled a barn full of them
and set it on fire
consuming them to cinders
for which
the judgement of god fell upon him
and he was devoured of rats alive
for when he fled from all places
they following him in great multitudes
he went into a tower in the midst of the rhine
called the rats-tower for ever after
whither the rats swam after him
but it lay not in the strength or policy of man to deliver him
for there they devoured him alive
a jacobine poisoned henry the 7
emperor
with his breaden god
john de roma
a jacobine friar
one of the holy house of spain
so persecuted the christians of merindol and gabriere
that he filled boots with hot grease
and drew them on their legs
both to draw them to confession
and make them confess where their money was
a monk called heran
presuming of his merits
by reason of his holiness
and austerity of life
after fifty years was persuaded by the devil to throw himself into a deep well
from whence preserved and taken out by miracle
he could not be persuaded
or removed from any other opinion
but that it was an angel appeared unto him
to make him glorious to posterity
philip the emperor
and his successor otho
were both brought to their destruction by the practices of innocent the third
and why may not i bring in here
that king john of england was poisoned by a monk of swinsted abbey
seeing they themselves bring it in
and insert it in their stories
about the year 1513
henry of lutzenburg was poisoned in the sacrament by a dominican friar
which baptista ignatius affirms
and sleidan recites the reason
from a motive of clement the fifth
because he grew too strong in italy
but what followed
many friars of that order were slain afterwards by the soldiers
pope innocent the fourth was charged with the poisoning of frederic the emperor
by means of peter de vinca
but escaping at that time
he was afterward murdered by manfred
by the same pope &apos;s practice
joan queen of naples was murdered by the privity and consent of vrbane the sixth
charles king of naples
by the nefarious and bloody counsel of clement the fourth
caused conradinus and frederic duke of austria to be put to death
which at last cost the young prince his life
and
so murder upon murder followed
and the popes themselves were defamed for such hateful mischief and treasons
sixtus the fourth
was the principal contriver of that treason
whereby julian de medici &apos;s was slain
and his brother laurence hurt in the church of reparata at florence
at the elevation of the sacrament
for volateran saith
that the pope knew of it
and countenanced the malefactors
alexander the sixth most inhumanely caused gemes the turks brother to be empoisoned
being seduced and corrupted by the bribes of the great turk
and promises of more money
henry the third of france was most shamefully murdered by a dominican friar
called james clement
and the fact not only allowed of at rome
but highly commended by the pope
the lamentable story of that man of men henry the fourth of france
is not yet forgotten
and whensoever it pleaseth god to spread abroad the carpet of revenge
oh what foul souls peradventure will appear under fair faces
the late prince of orange was first wounded by john jauregui
and afterward murdered by baltasar gerard
being both persuaded by masspriests and friars
that such a facinorous act must needs be meritorious
i could also name michael reinion
peter de four
and peter pann
animated to kill prince maurice
all instructed by priests and jesuits
who are indeed the very incendiaries of the pope &apos;s furnace
to set all europe in combustion
what should i trouble you further with their own murdering one another for the papacy
with the cruelties of the consistorian cardinals
and the exorbitant wickedness
which streameth all over the city
and is more infectious to their souls
than the plague
which often happens in that place
to their bodies
concerning their blasphemies
i mean not to trouble you much with their oaths
strange invented 7
their blasphemies
oaths
forswearing
protestations
execrations
curses
equivocations
or such like
for i have other things to make you amazed withal
and such fearful speeches hammered on the anvil of the devil &apos;s shop
that i must needs say with the poet
horresco referens
yet i will begin gently
and tell you
it was a proverb
a common proverb in those times
he sweareth like an abbot
a certain priest at rome
who had been angered by a courtesan
burst out into an oath
and swore by potta de la virgin
when the monks had no wine
they used to send to their brethren
and say
date nobis de oleo vestro
quia lampades nostra extinguuntur
a certain friar preaching of the passion of christ
acted his gesture in such a manner
that he moved his auditory to shed tears
which when he perceived
he changed the accent of his voice
and cried out
weep not so greatly
for perhaps it is not true
which i told you
a wicked priest of toures
railing on the huguenots
for putting their trust in christ
durst adventure to tell them
that for his part he would believe the pope before christ
julius &apos; the third
called john de maria de monte
exclaimed thus
that if god was so angry for the eating of an apple
how great reason had he to be raged at the loss of his peacock
which meat he loved so well
cardinal bembus in a conference about their glory and wealth in the world
exclaimed with a smile
oh what riches have we gotten by this fable of christ
a popish prelate railing against lutherans
said plainly
that sure saint peter at the first was a lutherane
for out of the presumption of his faith
he would needs come to christ on the water
and might thereby have been drowned
if not saved miraculously
menot a frenchman
and barlet an italian
said
that if christ had not been crucified
the virgin mary would have performed it with her own hands for the salvation of mankind
the papists in general confess perfection in the rules of monks and friars
and the masspriests of trent do make traditions equal to scriptures
and they commonly deny scriptures to be a perfect rule of life and doctrine
the turks punish feverely such as blaspheme christ
but papists
i mean
the monks and friars tear him in pieces with their hands and mouths
for such are thought to be most clear of heresy
that can swear most wickedly
and blaspheme outrageously
though papists profess jesus christ
etc
yet do they teach that dogs and hogs do eat his body
as oft as they eat the consecrated host
the pope is called the sovereign lord of purgatory
and can deliver souls from thence by indulgences and pardons
the turks deny all manner of god-hood in man
yea
in their own prophet mahomet
and verily believe
that cosdras was vanquished by the romans
for calling himself a god
but the popes not only call themselves so
but have decreed it heretical to think otherwise
i could load you with examples
but these shall suffice
for i would not raise this mount too high
considering i determine but a kind of hillock
to overlook the neighbour fields
and easy passages
only i will add hereunto how god hath been displeased with these men
even as far as desperate deaths and punishments
yet neither have they repent
but died in their perfidious blasphemies
nor others taken warning
but continued in their malicious wickedness
the chancellor of france cried out on his deathbed
oh cardinal
thou hast sent us all to the devil
bonanenture de periere
author of that detestable book
called symbolum mundi
ran himself upon his sword
and died most desperately
as razis
and others in switzerland threw themselves headlong from high rocks
by reason of the blasphemies of pope &apos;s prelate &apos;s
the chancellor and legate du prat made a fair hospital
of which francis the first was wont to say
it was not half large enough to lodge so many poor people
as he had undone
he died at nantovillet of a strange disease
his stomach eaten thorough with worms
and while his coffers were sealing up
he roved
and said
see
what is gotten with serving the king with soul and body
stephen ponchier
archbishop of toures
labouring to erect a new court against the professors of true religion
called the burning chamber
was attached by a disease
named le feu de dieu
beginning at his feet
and rising up to his head
so that he was constrained to cut off one leg and member after another
till he died
john ruze a chancellor of parliament
and great blasphemer of god
and persecutor of the protestants
had a burning disease in his privities and stomach
which consumed him
claudius &apos; des asses
a great swearer and blasphemer
the same day he had condemned a protestant to be burnt
as he was in the act of filthiness with one of his chambermaid &apos;s
the same day died of an apoplexy
oh the lamentable deaths of our own clergy in england
raving
and blaspheming god even at the last gasp
as they say
namely
the bishop of winchester
cardinal bewford
cardinal wolsey
cardinal poole
gardner
bonner
and diverse others
john andrew a stationer
and a spy against protestants
set on by the popish clergy
died stark mad
and railing both against god and them
john menier
lord of opidel
fell into a strangury and burning disease
blaspheming his creator
and crying out against the clergy
a jacobine friar
called de roma
withdrawing himself to avignon
determined to make merry with the spoils of the protestants of provence
where he was first robbed by his own servants
and then died in beggary of a strange disease
petrus castellanus was once a professor of the gospel
in the time of francis the first
and so displeased the sorbonists at paris
afterwards he returned as they say
to the vomit
in the reign of henry the second
and thereupon was made the bishop of orleans
the reason is rendered
because the protestants had no countenance nor honour
but what followed he fell into a strange disease
the one half of his body was as hot as fire
the other as cold as might be
which
joined with a bloody flix
killed him at last
but before he died
all were amazed at his sorrow and extremity

concerning their ignorance and doltishness
7
their blasphemies
for the general
it is well known
that many priests could scarce read latin
much less understand it
and knew not their mass and matins
but by the great letters
yea when they were drunk
were often deceived in the rules of the pie
and would diverse times repeat one for another
insomuch that in england we had these phrases
ignorant sir john
a very dunce
a queen mary &apos;s priest
and such like
but to make you sport
and give you some examples
it is a common tale of a pretty boy
that set the priest &apos;s barn on fire
and speaking to him in his own latin
all was burnt
because he understood him not
pogius the florentine hath a hundred examples of the priests of his time
that knew no latin
when they came to receive orders
they are called his facetiae
and indeed he sets down the stories
merely for jests and laughter
there was an italian friar
that told the people
they were to celebrate that week the feast of epiphany
but by his troth he knew not
whether it were man or woman
when a certain priest read the gospel of christ &apos;s feeding so many men with a few loaves and fishes
he named 500 for 5000
at which the clerk being discontented
stepped to him
and told him he was mistaken
it was 5000
hold thy peace
replied the priest
i pray god they believe this number
there was a certain priest
that supposed dignus
was latin to dine
for when he came to the bishop to be preferred to a benefice
the bishop only asked him
he replied
that if it pleased his lordship
he would dine with his gentlemen
what should i name him
that could not tell the father of the four sons of aimon
or him
that knew not who begat japhet
for all they said
that noah had three sons
some
ham
and japhet
there was a priest in italy so absurdly ignorant
that when he came to baptise an infant
he accustomed to say
of diverse priests the relation is thus
a curate of artois suing his parishioners for not paving the church
alleged the prophet jeremy for his action — paveant illi
&amp; non pavean ego
a profound clerk
being urged with certain laws
called clementina and novella
was very angry
that they objected to him the testimony of whores and harlots
prat the chancellor
interpreting henry the 8
letter to francis the french king
englished
so many mules
in stead of mastiffs
hugo carensis will not have diabolus
a slanderer
but to eat up one at two morsels
body and soul
in the conference holden at poyssi
a priest called demochares
pleading for images
was so ignorant
that he had no other thing to allege
but the painted windows of saint denis
true
answered the minister
your argument is made of glass
the papists commend the collier &apos;s faith
that could answer the devil nothing
but that he believed
as the church believeth
although he knew not what that belief was
whereupon linwood and others say
it is sufficient to believe the articles of the creed
and no more
dante saith
that the friars preach their own inventions
and tell idle tales without edification
and cornelius agrippa condemneth their ignorance
as preaching mere toys
and humane devices
as not understanding any other
alfonsus &apos; à castro saith
that diverse popes were utterly unlearned
for one of them
in stead of fiat
said fiatur
gregory the sixth
according to laziardus
understood not the mass
pope zachary condemned virgilius
a bishop of germany
as an heretic
for saying there were antipodes
and paul the second could not endure the name of academy
as an enemy to all learning
john peckam
in the provincial constitution
thinketh it sufficient for priests once in a quarter of a year to expound the articles of the creed
ten commandments
the two commandments of the gospel
the seven works of mercy
the seven deadly sins
the seven virtues
the seven sacraments
and that without curiosity
durandus teacheth us
that the two points of a bishop &apos;s mitre
signifieth the old and new testament
but joys mersilius
an augustine friar saith
that the two strops of the mitre that hang on the bishop &apos;s back
do signify
that he neither understood the old nor new testament
alnarus pelagius complaineth
that the bishops of spain committed thousands of souls to their kinsmen priests
that had no learning
and the germans of late told adrian the sixth
that unlearned idiots
unfit
vile
and ridiculous fellows were made priests
the monks and friars at this hour can scarce read their canonical hours
for in the monastery of fulda
the monks accused rabanus manrus for being learned
and studying the scriptures
and neglecting their temporalities
but of late
lest children should mock the popish priests
that cannot read their mass with true accents
every word in common missals is accented
and yet they miss every day
9 concerning their beastliness
both in ribaldry and other actions
i will insist the 9 their beastliness less
because the are filthy
and can no way delight either chaste ears
nor a civil auditory yet to keep correspondency with my division
something must be spoken befitting this discourse
and agreeable to the section
in other places as well as there
when women came to confession
the friars and priests would demand of them
whether they were sodomites or no
many times putting them in mind of that
which they understood not
and causing a filthiness to be practised
which before they knew
you shall read in the life of juniperus
whom saint francis held for an honest man
that he commonly used to defile his bed
by ravening in of hodgepodge diet
as seething cabbages
roots
bacon
beef
flesh
veal
pigeons
and all together
without either scumming the pot
or cleanly dressing
they tell it for a jest
and yet not to be denied
that the monk ruffinus drove away the devil
by threatening to untruss a point in his throat
in the life of saint dominick
a certain man was possessed with devils
whereupon the saint bound about his neck certain relics
whereof some of them were no better then shitten clouts at the least
whose perfume the devils could not abide
and therefore cried out they would depart
but the holy man would not believe them
till the relics were sureties for them
as he also preached
the women were amazed
and cried out
that if he said true
they had served a very strange master
he bade them be quiet
and they should see what master they had served
whereupon enters in among them an ugly cat
with flaming eyes
showing his posteriors unto them
which were more filthy then in other beasts
at last he leaps into the belfry
and left such a stink behind him
that had almost choked them all
in the legend of s
dominick
a nun called mary
had a sore thigh
for which she prayed to s
dominick
as daring not to pray to god
who pitying her
came to her when she was asleep
and anointed the place
pope felix the eighth after s
gregory
built a church in the honour of s
cosmas
and s
damias
wherein one had his thigh almost rotten off with a canker
but these saints came with salves and ointments
yea took very excrements to cure the fellow
but when they saw they could do no good
they cut off a leg of an aethiopian newly buried
and put it to the man
and so cured him
at lodone in gascoine
the mouse that had eaten their bready god
was canonised
and called the holy mouse
the famous fransciscan de cornibus
died of the neapolitan disease
yet
when the buttons and pimples broke forth
and made him look fiery red
they reported he became a seraphin
yea
when a gentlewoman died of the stink
by kissing of his feet
it rather confirmed their opinion
than gave them eyes to look into the villainy
when a certain cardinal made report
that there was a woman possessed by a devil
who could not be conjured
no
quoth lon the public notary
give her but a glister of holy-water
and the devil will be gone
i warrant you
it is written in the life of pope sixtus the 4
that he granted liberty to the whole family of the cardinal of
s
luce
to use carnal company with the male sex
during the three hottest months
and pope alexander the 6
permitted peter mendoza
a spaniard
and cardinal of valentia
to make a ganymede of his bastard son
the marquis of zannet
but of this no more

concerning their fooleries
&amp; absurdities
10
their fooleries
i know not werhe to begin
nor once beginning
how to make an end
for there are so many remarkable things of this kind
that i stand amazed at the blindness of former times
that could not discover such fopperies and abuses
and wonder at their superstitious ignorance
which would not suffer them to be led into the fairer fields of knowledge
but to the purpose
a franciscan
putting on a short garment
and leaving off his breeches of purpose
used such emphatical speeches and gestures to the people which stood before him
about the passion of christ on a good friday
that they fell a weeping
but such as were behind
seeing his naked buttocks
as he bowed himself
fell also a laughing
he proved so ridiculous in the action
robert liciencis
another franciscan
could cause either sorrow
or laughter
by the enforcement of his words
and manner of his gesture
yea he had a trick to win wagers with his pot-companions of either &apos;s enforcement
a friar having a sweetheart
who loved him extraordinarily
but could not endure his habit
he took occasion one day to preach of the wars against the turk
and coming to the point of choosing a general
or captain
he threw off the gown
and preached in the habit of a soldier
which became him so well
that his sweetheart seeing him
was much delighted with his presence
and when for this and other fooleries he was sent for before the cardinals
he answered them very merrily and reverently
that he did it to please his love
not in any contempt of his order
or the catholic religion
a certain curate complained to his parishioners in this sort
alas
what would you have me do
o my parishioners
you bring me no offerings
and i see none of you die
how shall i live then
think ye
the franciscans of enreux counterfeited a ghost
or a spirit
to procure money
and a young franciscan novice
called harecourt
at orleans
counterfeited the ghost of the provost marshal &apos;s wife
because he gave but six crowns to the franciscans
at triers in germany
in the abbey of saint simon
saint joseph &apos;s pantoffles have been in request a long time
and in aix they showed his breeches
with the virgin maries smock
nay
there is not so much as the tail of the ass
on which our saviour road
but it is at genoa accounted for a relic
and in the country of lorraine the holy hay found in the cratch
where our saviour was laid
is very famous
at the blackfriars in arles
at vigand in languedock
and at florence
the stones are showed that killed saint steven
with the arrows wherewith saint sebastian was wounded
when nicodemus took our saviour down from the cross
he gathered some of his blood
and put it in one of the fingers of his glove
by which he wrought many miracles
&amp; for which he was persecuted by the jews
so that he was glad to be rid of it
and took a piece of parchment
writing therein all his miracles
and what the blood was
rolling it together
and enclosing it in the beak of a bird
and so tying it hard
cast it into the sea
but after 1200 years
the waves drove it into normandy
among certain shrubs
where a duke found it
and built the abbey of beck in the place
for hunting of a stag
and losing him and the dogs
they were all found kneeling before the birds bill
which when it was searched
discovered the secret
and the miracle wrought the duke to devotion
and as i said
made him build a glorious abbey
what say you to christ &apos;s blood kept in vyals
gathered from under the cross by his mother
the tears of christ
the swaddling bands of christ
the milk of the virgin mary

an admonishion to the bishops of winchester
london and others
make no tarrying to turn unto the lord and put not of from day to day
for suddenly shall his wrath come
&amp; in the time of vengeance he shall destroy the
from roan by michaelwood
many great men and potentates of the world
when they have by their unlawful and unrighteous attempts
brought themselves into extreme miseries
have at last much blamed their unfortunable estate
for that they in due time lacked counsel to have withdrawn them from such enterprises
so it is said in the common proverb
that the rich and mighty have seldom good council
except they get it of themselves
for riches and high dignity causeth them to be more insolent
so that they can abide any thing better
then to be told of their faults
and the reward of him that should frankly tell them the truth
may sooner be a brokehead then otherwise
this prudent men perceiving
rather withdraw them selves from them
than with wearying them selves in vain procure to them selves displeasure
and flatterers seeing a ready pray at their hands
daily follow upon them
with upholding their deeds and words good or bad al is excellently devised
prudently spoken
done like a good man
thus with their own pride climbing and with flattery pricked forward
they run headlong in their imaginations
till they tumble down into the pit of destruction
and then they lay the blame from them selves to other
where indeed they would never hear other
but such as served
yea rather deceived their affections with flatteries
but against such headstrong hastiness we are admonished by the holy ghost saying
be not wise in thine own conceit
fear god
&amp; departed from evil
this we wish that all men would well consider in their enterprises
first that there is a god
not a blind and deaf god
as the godless heathen painted jupiter at create
but an everliving god that seeth all the ways of adam &apos;s children
that knoweth the oppress our and him that is oppressed
that will call all things into judgement and to account and will render to every one his just recompense upon his head
him ought men to fear
for whatsoever they attempt yet at last
that he determineth must come to pass
and his will in all things shall be accomplished
this i pray you to consider now in due time
lest if you now forget it
it may hereafter chance to you as it hath done to other that in their wealth little studied on these matters
god hath marvellously saved you from the hands of such as hated you
and set you in high dignity
more than ever you had in your life
and doubtless it is to do good and not evil
to correct and amend things amiss
not to destroy and break down things that are in good case and order
your proceedings begin strangely
in that you at the first go about to deface the holy word of god
to set aside christ &apos;s institution
and to call all this realm to blindness and error
for if you take away the light of god &apos;s word from the world
what can men look for at your hands
but destruction and error
david saith
thy word o lord is a candle for my feet psalm cxviii
and a light for my steps
and christ sayeth
he that followeth me
walketh not in darkness
but shall have the light of life
we know that you have in times past nothing favoured the scriptures to be in english
but have ever winsed and kicked against them
but our hope was that once you would amend
considering how gods goodness called you to repentance
you were wont to allege you did nothing but as a common counsellor
yea you obtested by god
that when men were burned for the truths sake
you nothing procured to it
but did all that you might to the contrari
we were glad to read this in your writings
but we beseech you let the same now appear in your deeds
so shall we the better believe your writings
but if now you raise a new persecution for the words sake
truly it shall be manifest to all men
that ye were guilty of all the blood that hath been shed before time for the word of god
which blood though it be yet unadueuged yet it remaineth fresh and new in the sight of god
with abel &apos;s blood crying unto god
and with the blood of the holy martyrs saying
how long tarriest thou lord holy and true
to judge and to avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth
doubt ye not but their cry is heard and not forgotten afore god
for he maketh inquisition for their blood
and remembreth them
and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor
the office of a bishop is not to be a butcher
it is to preach god &apos;s word
not to put it down
to help such as be captives
not to cast into prison the righteous that are at liberty
to carry the poor lambs upon their shoulders
not to seek all means possible to consume them with fire or halter
o miserable lambs that shall have such shepherds
whose study is not to feed them
but to keep them from the pasture of god &apos;s word
and to poison them with dreams of men &apos;s imaginations
o horrible judgement of god
that christ and his gospel shall be called new learning and heresy
what can the turk do more than rail against christ and blaspheme his holy testament
yet must christian men be compelled to hear antichrist
and to hold their peace
when the blood of the new testament is blasphemed
what is in your latin mass
to edify with the church of england
that all things read or done in the common congregation
should be done in that tongue that the congregation understandeth
that the unlearned may say amen
and boner hath set up again in paul &apos;s salisbury latin portace
whereof the lai men understandeth no word
and god knoweth no more do the greater part of the portas patterers
paul had the spirit of christ
and what can we judge of boner doing contrary to saint paul &apos;s doctrine
if the most godly and perfect book of service which even you you rself have both in preaching and writing commended please not him
why doth he not set out his church service in english
but he knoweth well enough that there is such monstrous things in it
that if it were in english
english boys would laugh it scorn
such lies are in the saints legends
such manifest errors
that no colour can defend them yet must these occupy the place
and that in latin to make simple and plain people believe
that there is in the latin tongue some privy holy mystery truth needeth no corners or cloaks to hide it self
nor to be in a strange hid tongue
as errors ever seek the darkness to be their shield and defence every one that doth evil as christ saith hateth the light
iho iii and cometh not to the light
that his deeds should not be reproved
but he that doth the truth cometh to the light
that his deeds may be known
for they are done in god christ ordained the holy communion that christian men should together eat the holy bread
and drink the holy cup in the remembrance of his body broken
and his blood shed
paul delivered to us the same that he received of the lord
commanding us saying
as oft as ye shall eat of this bread
and drink of this cup
ye shall show the lords death until he come
i pray you
how is this observed in your private masses
where your shaven priests for the more part can as well build paul &apos;s steeple
as fulfil paul &apos;s commandment
you have not one word of scripture to maintain this profanation of christ &apos;s institution
and it is an horrible and fearful thing that ever man mortal should presume such great impiety against the immortal and everliving god
you rage sore against married priests which have for them gods word
but you forget the unchaste and detestable sodomies
incests
adulteries
fornications
murdering of infants
that hath been found in the unmarried sort of shave linges
which have no word of god but this
for such things sake
cometh the wrath of god upon the children of unbelief
and whore mongers and adulterers shall not inherit the kingdom of christ
you bishops should lay no snares to damn men &apos;s souls
but rather help them out that be in such damnable estate
and that which gods word leaveth at liberty
you ought not to bring into bondage
that you deprive the married priests of their offices &amp; livings
it is very strange
and no word of god have ye so to do
and we nothing doubt it
but though god at this present exercises the patience of his servants
yet he will at last remember his promise
for the troubles sake of the oppressed
and because of the complaint of the poor
i will up saith the lord i will help them
and set them at rest
and in isaiah the lord saith
woe be to the thou robber
shalt not thou be rob also
thou that despisest other
shalt not thou also be despised
the lord will doubtless hear the sorrowful weepings of the poor widows and fatherless children which by this robbery are driven to beggary
the lord heareth the prayer of the oppressed
he will not despise the prayer of the fatherless
nor the widow lamentably complaining to him
doth not god see the tears of the widow
and hear her exclamation against such as cause her to weep
from her cheek they ascend into heaven
and the lord that favourably heareth her
will have no pleasure in them
for gods honour therefore
and for fear of his judgement
call these things to your mind
and somewhat mitigate these hasty and rash doings
which are against god &amp; his word
for though the lord hath called you to be a scourge to other
yet remember he commandeth you to do nothing unrighteousely
for he is a god that willeth none unrighteousness
their may no ungodly person dwell with him
such as be cruel
may not stand in his sight
he is enemy unto all wicked doers
he destroyeth the liars and abhorieth the blood thirsty and deceitful
and as you now are raised to scourge others
so if you vex the innocent
doubtless the lord will throw you down
and raise up them that shall scourge you again
and fulfil christ &apos;s word
with what measure ye mete to other
the same shall be measured to you again
remember we beseech you
that as glory groweth
so envy against you groweth
not of good
but of evil men
who though they now like echo rebound ever with pleasant sound of your own voice
yet will they if god a little withdraw his hand from you be the first that shall rejoice at your fall
god will withdraw his hand from you
if you repugn against his word
if you seek to deface his truth
to cast aside christ &apos;s supper
to condemn marriage
to set up again idolatry
superstition and error
to bring in again that sodomitical feigned chastity
that drew infinite unto eternal damnation
we need not recite unto you examples what god hath done with princes and potentates
that have enterprised to resist his truth
or else to abuse it to their own private lusts
seeing you have not only read
but seen before your eyes
only we pray god you may remember what was said to
saul saul why persecutest thou me
he said
lord who art thou
the lord said
i am jesus whom thou persecutest
it shall be hard for the to kick against the prick
it is the lord jesus that in his members suffereth
it is his word that is hated and persecuted
it is he that mercifully calleth you to repentance
and he is able enough to repress all violence done against him
but as he came from heaven to save sinners
so would he rather call saul to repentance
than cast nero into destruction
but when all things shall declare you impenitent
&amp; manifest rebellor against gods word
then without doubt the lord will no more spare you
than he hath before time spared other
for god &apos;s sake therefore beware in due time and take example at others
lest other here after take example at you
acts
judas betraying the truth
purchased the bloody field
for he hung himself
and all his guts burst forth
pharaoh persecuting the people of god
got gods vengeance &amp; manifold plagues upon egypt
and he that thirsted blood
was drowned in the red sea
jamnes and jambres his prophets were at last compelled maugre their hearts to acknowledge the finger of god
how well sped hieroboam for erecting his golden calves at bethel and berseba
look for no better reward for erecting your satisfactory sacrifice
but how craftily do you cloine in this
you will command no man
but they shall say you
gratify the queen
god grant the queens grace plainly to see your falsehood
we are afraid you will bring the wrath of god upon her &amp; all this realm of england
as the priests &amp; prophets of dan &amp; bethel brought it upon the kings of israel and juda
you tell the queen the people is desirous of masses
and that they never favoured the scriptures
and you tell the people
the quencs pleasure is that they receive again the mass and popery
thus you cause no small number of hearts to be withdrawn from that hearty love and affection that they ought to bear to the queens highness
and as much as in you is sow the seed of dissension
which the lord of heaven keep from among us
and grant you to take wiser wares
the people doubtless was fully stayed in conscience
and quieted in the right way of gods word
and would have continued in the same
if you and others had not with your damnable persuasions
crafty surrelties
cruel handlings
gone about to pervert them
and every man may see
that some for hope of lucre and promotion
some for fear of punishment and loss
are ready to return as dogs to their vomit
and swine to their former puddle
as for such as all this time have dissembled
&amp; now openly declare their cankered stomachs
as ready to turn with every wind
as any weathercock
no marvel of their inconstancy in religion
for their ground is not the sure foundation of god &apos;s word
but the slippery sand of pleasing men
ye shall do doubtless a goodly act to serve such men &apos;s affections
and to rebel against god &apos;s truth
doubt not but at last ye shall have some cardinals hat for your labour
think not but god can raise a hiehue when his pleasure is
and will do it when achab least looketh for it
though poor esaias must be counted an heretic
yet god will avenge his blood
and the blood of all his servants the prophets that manasses hath shed
he answered
art thou one of the kings council
hold thy peace that isse the not
so you will say
hold thy peace thou heretic
or come fourth to dispute thy matters
if ye will dispute by the holy scriptures
by the doctors of the primitive church
it is already proffered unto you
but ye know ye can have none advantage that way
for your own conscience accuseth you
that ye are not able to stand
either with scriptures or ancient doctors to prevail against the truth
as little honour will come thereof to you in disputing
as is already won in writing
therefore your old arguments which your preachers now at paul &apos;s cross
most earnestly beat into the people &apos;s heads are suresby
fire &amp; faggot dispatcheth at once
but happy were ye
that such arguments were not made against you
well then
mark what the prophet answered amasias at his departing
and know certainly it will come to pass
the hand of the lord is not shortened
though our iniquities at this present have justly provoked his anger over us
he will at last pity us for his son christ our lords sake
and we nothing doubt
but as he his all mighty &amp; can deliver
so he his all full of goodness and will save all that trust in his mercy and call upon him day and night
and thanks to god the people hath other eyes
than they have had in times past
the holy word of god hath not been all so baren
as you would it had been
men have some knowledge between a latin satisfactory popishmass and christ &apos;s communion truly ministered according to the gospel
though you boast chastity of priests
men know a difference between a single life
&amp; a chaste life
years since some of your unmarried priests
yea as it said one of your great doctors
were complained on for their hot chastity that burned a woman
men remember yet since some priests were indicted for getting women with child
and murdering the children when they were borne
oh horrible chastity to be suffered among christians god doubtless will viset these things in due time
as he visited the sins of the wicked before time
mark how he rod was eaten with worms nero slew himself
julianus confessed christ in death against his will
antiochus stank above the earth
but to come nearer our days
more and fisher with friar forest &amp; other
desperately died in the contempt of the gospel
dudleia deceitful tyrant deceived with hope of pardon
blasphemed the gospel at the hour of death
of whom ye make a pillar to stay up your church
beware of the sin against the holy ghost
which shall not be forgiven in this world
not in the world to come
those that despise moses
die without redemption
under two or iii witnesses
but how sorer punishment remaineth
for them
that tread under foot the blood of the new testament
and rail upon the spirit of grace
once again we beseech you
for jesus christ &apos;s sake
and for the hope of the life to come
and for the judgement that we all must come afore
remember these things
and think that he that wrote this for your admonition looketh for no preferment at your hand but writeth it
if perchance ye be not altogether a damnable desperate
ye may convert to god
reverence his holy word give place to his truth
&amp; be saved from the wrath of god that is to come
god grant us all mercy and grace to turn to him
that we may be able to stand before the lord at his coming
when he shall arise to judge the earth
read the second psalm
and see what shall happen to the rebels against the lord and christ his son
therefore fear the lord
do homage unto his son
serve him with trembling &amp; feat
receive his doctrine
lest he be angry with you
&amp; so you perish from the right way
for when his wrath shall be kindled like fire which shall be shortly blessed shall all those be that trust in him
amen
certain english verses penned by david gwyn
who for the space of eleven years and ten months was in most grievous servitude in the galleys under the king of spain
and now lately by the wonderful providence of god
delivered from captivity
to the overthrow of many of the spaniards
and the great rejoicing of all true hearted english men

certain english verses
presented to the queen &apos;s most excellent majesty
in the park at saint james
on sunday the xviii
of august 1588 such rebels as do mean to sell
their crown to foreign foes
against their queen for to rebel whose secrets god disclose
mark well
and read this story mine
though simple and rude it be
and to your queen with heart incline let treason from you flee
for i am one that captive am
and know the spaniards heart
although he love the traitor &apos;s name
at length he makes him smart
he gives the traitor daily pay
while treason is a working
but afterwards to his decay
he cuts him short from barking
which is the due and just reward
that doth belong to treason
the hangman takes him by the beard
to cut his head with reason
examples many i could bring
which lately hath been proved
of those that wrote to philip king
whose hearts to treason moved
the youthful duke of bragan soil
bargansiae called by name
who gave the portugal the spoil
and brought himself to shame
also the coundie of caskails
did join with him in treason
pretending for to purchase veils
being void and clear of reason
and so they sold their native land
to philip king of spain
who having portugal in hand
as king therein did reign
who suddenly did turn his face
from this good duke and gave no credit to their race
wherein they knew the folly
therefore good christian countrymen
take heed
beware betime
let no false treason move you then
to pope
nor spanish king
let not affection blind your eyes
nor popish tales deceive
let not the spaniards tales nor lies
constrain you to believe
for they are devils
and are not gods
seeing people they deceives
i wish you well
believe him not
if you will live at ease
therefore you saxon sort
that rebels mean to live
mark well
and read the evil report
that portugals do give
the southern spanish race
that mankind would subject
to turn us all from christ &apos;s laws
to live in popish sect
repent therefore in time
and call to god for grace
to queen elizabeth do incline
and fly from spaniards race
be true unto the english crown
and do the pope detest
procure to beat the spaniards down
the romans
and the rest
examples good you may well take
of italy
and cicilia soil
by spaniards
flanders all doth quake
they portugal did spoil
therefore
good english knights
be true unto your queen
in noble minds set your delights
and fly from treason clean
mark well a captives plaint
that doth lament your case
to queen elizabeth be you not faint
and call to god for grace
and thus with mournful heart
from galley i do end
where i do feel the bitter smart
of popish spanish men
farewell good native soil
farewell good country mine
defend your land from spanish foil
and fly from spanish line
i writ with doleful pen
my leave of you to take
my life i lead in galley chain
from whence my moan i make
an other at the same time delivered to her majesty by david gwyn
the eagle and the lion fierce
do join their subjects all
against the saxon soil to pierce
their counsel they do call
to know the way for to obtain their long desired will
in judgement seat they sit again
to utter all their skill
and as the commons brag and boast
a fleet they mean to make
to sail unto the english coast
the queen and land to take
with help of rebels they do think
the saxon land to spoil
if queen and counsel do not wink
the land can have no foil
but those that lurketh in the den
and did not know the smart
i mean some kind of english men
which bears a spanish heart
they think the crown of joy to win
by treason and by guile
against the christian english queen
to please the spaniards wile
therefore good nobles play your part
defend your queen and land
against the spaniards show your art
your force and mighty hand
good christian clergy
send abroad your preachers for to show
how bondage is a deadly rod
in winter &apos;s time you know
the spaniards make the christian slave
and bondmen unto thrall
their heads &amp; beards they daily shave
which is a dreadful fall
they mean with force of fiery sword
your saxon land to run
they say it is for christ &apos;s word
and romans laws among
they swear by christ
and by their beards
the english queen to take
the counsel and the nobles heads
to make them all to quake
the merchant and the ventures
with spanish brag they threat
the officers and the labourers
with fists they mean to beat
therefore you worthy wights
that pass the southern seas ▪ man out your princely ships
your foes for to displease
and keep your english coast
from philip king of spain
and from all those that daily boast
to put you all to pain
i writ no more
i wish you well
my mind you may well know
from captives chain where i do dwell

an other presented to her majesty by david gwyn in commendation of sir francis drake
o noble knight
o worthy wight
o prince of navigation
in martial affairs is thy delight
for country &apos;s preservation
thy noble fame like phoebus &apos; trim
in all the world is spread
as eclipse the sun and moon doth dim
so spaniards do thee dread
thy valiant acts and worthy heart
deserves eternal fame
thy knowledge and astrologies art doth verify the same
thy happy course that thou didst run unto the western land
did make the spaniards all to shun
as fearing of thy hand
sanda domingo makes great moan
carthagena eke doth cry
the western isles do greatly groan
thy force hath been so nigh
kalles likewise doth greatly fear
with reason thereunto
the narrow straits do daily care
because thou art their foe
thy enterprise hath been so high
that turks could not compare
nor with his galleys come so nigh
which makes them all to fear
the grand english they thee do call of famous good report
the spaniards and the portugal
to england will resort
to serve the queen &amp; thee
good drake for thy good famous acts
the spanish king they will forsake with england to compact
thou art so dread as god is feared
in southern coast and land
the spaniard daily shakes his beard
and fears thy mighty hand
therefore good worthy drake
serve thou thy sovereign queen
and make the spanish foe to quake
and english force be seen
for help and aid thou shalt not want thy virtuous queen is bend
money and victuals is not scant
and men will not repent
if thou wilt follow victory
as first thou didst begin
all protestants will pray for thee
and for our gracious queen
the spaniards brag and make great boast as thou dost partly know
a huge great fleet they make in haste
as letters mine did show
wherein i writ a warning good
to thee and to the queen
rehearsing all both bad and good that in their fleet was seen
also i wrote the sum of men
as near as i could learn
and sent it by an englishman
whereby thou mightest discern
to know thy foes
and what they be
all kind of generation
the dukes and earls in their degree rehearsed by relation
their ships and force i daily wrote
and all their preparation
to name them all i miss not
as void of desperation
and thus
good noble knight
my simple verse i end
unto thy hand good worthy wight
my help i do commend
and wish all english christian men to pray for me poor gwyn
that lieth in bondage and in chain with popish spanish king

well governed
if thou perceive them that been under thy governance to be by thy diligence wealthy and more temperate in living
set more by leaving to thy children honest fame or renown
than great possessions or richesse
for these be transitory
honest fame
the other immortalle
also goods may be gotten by fame
but good fame can be bought with no money
also goods happen to men that be of evil disposition
but so doth not good estimation
but cometh only to them that endeavour them self with virtue to get it
be delicate in thine apparel and garments that serve for thy body
in all other parts of thy living be continent as it beseemeth all princes of honour
that they that behold thee
for thine honourable presence may dame the worthy to be a governor
and thy family and servants for thy noble courage may have of the a like good opinion
consider diligently both thine own words and thy deeds
to the intent thou mayst fall in very few errors
of all things it is best to happen on the right point of all things that are to be done
but for as much as that is very hard to be known
better is to leave somewhat
than to exceed
for moderation shall prevail more
where somewhat doth lack than where that any thing is superfluous
courtesy &amp; gravity endeavour the to be both courtesy and of a reverend gravity
for the one beseemeth a prince
the other is expedient and more agreeable to every company
all be it to use both
it is of all other things the most difficille
for thou shalt find for the more part them that use a reverent gravity to be unpleasant
them that be curteous
to be of base courage and simple
therefore the one and the other is to be used
than exchne that thing
which in any of them is ill or seemeth not convenient
experience and philosophy
if thou wouldst perfectly know that
which belongeth to kings to perceive
give the to experience and study of philosophy
for philosophy shall declare unto the the means or ways how to bring to pass thine affairs
experience in semblable business shall make the able to do or sustain them
behold diligently
what as well princes as private persons do daily
and what of their acts doth succeed or happen
surely if thou remember well things that are passed
thou shalt the better consult of things coming
think where private persons have died with good will
to the intent that after their death they mought be commended
that it were great shame to princes not to travail in such study or business
whereby in their lives they may be worthily praised
desire to leave when thou diest
rather monuments or images of thy virtues than of thy parsonage
endeavour thee specially to keep always thy self and thy contrary in surety
if necessity constrain the to jeopard thy person
these rather to die with honour
than to live in reproach
in all thine acts remember that thou art a prince
and therefore do no thing unworthy to so noble a state
do not despise so thy nature
that thou suffer thy self all holy to perish
but in as much as thy body is mortal
and thy soul immortal
assay to leave to thy soul an immortal remembrance
use the to speak of honest affairs and studies
that by such custom thou mayst think on like things as thou speaketh of
things that in consultation seem to be best
those execute thou in thy proper acts
whose opinions thou enviest
his deeds do thou follow
lake what thou counsaylest thy children or servants to do
think it convenient that thy self do the semblable
either use that which i have advised the to do
or inquire for better than that is
suppose not them to be wise men
that sharply can talk of small things and trifles
but those that can substantially speak in matters of weighty importance
nor think not them wise
that promise to other men wealth and good fortune
they them self being in great necessity
but rather those that speaking of them selves moderately
can with other men and in their affairs use them self well and discreetly
and being not troubled with any channge of their living
know how to bear honestly and temperately as well adversity as also prosperity
and marvel thou not
that i have now rehearsed many things that thou knewest before
nor that forgot i not
but knew well enough
that being such a multitude as well of princes as of private persons
some of them have spoken the same that i did
&amp; many have heard it
&amp; diverse have seen other men done it
and some there be that by them selves have experienced it
notwithstanding in matter concerning instruction
novelty is not to be sought for
for therein ought not to be founden either singular opinion
or thing impossible
or contrary to men &apos;s expectation
but suppose that to be in hearing most gracious or pleasant
which being sown in the minds of other
may assemble most matter to the purpose
and the same declare best and most aptly
for this know i well
that the counsels and wise sentences of poets and other good authors
are thought of all men to be very profitable
yet will not they gladly give ear unto them
but be therewith in the same case
as they be with these that do give them good counsel
for they praise them all
but they care not how seldom they come in their company
desiring to be rather with offenders
than with them that of sin be the rebukers
example we may take of the poems or work of hesiodus
theognes
and phocilides
for every man affirmeth them to be excellent counsels concerning man &apos;s life
but all though they say so
yet had they liefer use that
whereto their own madness induceth them
than follow that
whereto the others precepts doth advise them
moreover if one should gather out of the said authors that which men call sentences
wherein they perchance have been studious
in semblable wise towards them should they be disposed
for they should with more pleasure here a lying fable or fantasy
than the said precepts made by much cunning and diligence
but what needeth it to tarry long upon every matter
generally if we will consider the natures of men
we shall perceive
that many of them delight neither in meats that been most wholesome
nor in studies that been most honest
nor in deeds that is most convenient
nor yet in doctrine that is most commodious
but embracing pleasant appetites
which be repugnant to profit
would seem to be painful and laborious
how may any man content any such persons
either by preaching or teaching
or telling of any thing that is profitable
that for the words that be spoken
do ennie and have indignation at them that speak truly
and do take them for plain men or simple
in whom lacketh wisdom
so much they abhor truth in all things
that they know not what is theirs
or do belong to their office
but consulting or reasoning of that which doth pertain unto them
they be sad and unpleasant
when they talk of other men &apos;s affairs they be merry and joyous
more over they had liefer suffer some grief in their bodies
than in revolving what should be most necessary
travail any thing in their minds
and if a man take good heed
he shall find in their mutual assembles and companies
that either they reprove other men
or else that they of other be in some thing reproved
and when they be by themselves
they be ever wishing and never consulting
i have not spoken this again all men but only again them that be guilty in that which i have rehearsed
finally this is apparent and certain
who so ever will make or write any thing pleasant and thankful to the multitude
he may not seek for words or matters most profitable
but for them that contain most fables and leasings
for in hearing such things they rejoice
but when they perceive to be labours and contentions in their affairs
than be they pensive
wherefore homer and they that found first tragedies
may be well marveled at
who in their work used both the said forms in writing
for homer expressed in the contentions and battles of them
which for their virtues were named half gods
the other brought those fables in to actual appearance
in so much as we not only may hear them
but also may presently behold them
by such example it is declared to them that be studious to please their hearers
that they must abstain from exhorting and counselling them
and that they apply them to write and speak that only
where in they perceive the multitude to have most delectation
this before written have i declared
thinking that it beseemeth not the that are not one of the people
to be of like opinion with the multitude
nor to judge things to be honest
or men to be pleasant
according to thy sensual appetite
but to try and esteem them by their good and profitable acts
moreover for as much as they that labour in the study of philosophy
concerning the exercise of the minds
be of sundry opinions
some saying that men become wiser by much disputing and reasoning
other affirm that it happeneth by exercise in politic governance or civil causis
divers suppose it to come of other doctrines
but finally they all do confess
that he which is well brought up
may by every of the said studies gather matter sufficient to give good counsel
therefore he that will leave the doubtful opinions
and will apply to that which is certain
he must examine the raisins thereof
and specially they that be counsellors ought to have consideration of the occasion
time and opportunity
if they can not bring that to pass
than to reject and put a way as well them which speak in all matters generally
as also those that know nothing that is expedient or necessary
for it is apparent and certain
that he which can not be to him self profitable
he shall in other men &apos;s business do nothing wisely
make much of them that be wise
and do perceive more than other men
and have good regard toward them
remembering that a good counsellor
a good counsellor
is of all other treasure the most royal and profitable
and think verily that they which can most aid and profit to thy wit or reason
shall make thy kingdom most ample and honourable
wherefore for my part as much as i can
i have exhorted thee
and honoured the with such presents as be in my power to give the and desire thou not
that other men should bring unto thee
as i said at the beginning
their accustomed presents
which ye should buy much dearer of the givers
than of the sellers
but covet thou such presents
which if thou do use well and diligently omitting no time
thou not only shalt not consume them
but thou shalt also increase them
and make them of more estimation and value

1
of the miserable birth of man
and of his first calamities
man being the image of god
and the chief work of nature
of all other creatures is most miserable in his birth
for
both beasts and birds are brought into the world
either covered with hair
feathers
or wool
not so much as the seeds and corn of the ground
but nature hath clothed them with ears and husk
man only excepted
for he being once come from the prison of his mother &apos;s womb
seemeth no other thing
but the similitude of a poor worm
that cometh creeping out of the earth
with what clothing is he covered
making his entry into the palace of this world
but only with blood
where in he is bathed and covered
the which signifieth no other thing but the image and figure of sin
what is the first song that he singeth at his coming into the world
but only weepings &amp; wail
which are as messengers
and foreshowers of his calamities to come
the which because he cannot express in words
he witnesseth by tears
likewise pitiful cries in the beginning of monarchs
emperors
and kings
and others
that cause so many tragedies to happen in the world
but now chose
the worm
be he never so little
as soon as nature hath brought him out of the earth
beginneth to crawl and creep
and to seek for food
the little chicken so soon as he is out of the shell
is found clean
and needeth not to be washed like unto man
but runneth after the hen
and knoweth when he is called
he picketh and eateth
he feareth the kite
without proving before her malice
he flieth danger only guided by nature
but behold man
so soon as he is come into the world
is like unto a little monster
and a lump of flesh
which will let himself to be eaten of other beasts
if he be not seen unto
and die for hunger before he can find his mother &apos;s breast
and will as soon eat poison
as good meat
and handle hot from
before he can discern the good from the evil
yet for all this
he nameth himself the prince of all other creatures
thus man being brought into this miserable world
and plunged in the gulf of miseries
he than requireth to have nourishment and clothing
to comfort the infirmity of his nature
the office of which is appointed to mothers
in consideration whereof nature hath given them breasts
which are like two little bottles
very proper and necessary for their sustenance
but now to speak of the misery of man in his nurture
how many mothers are there at this day in the world
nay rather we may truly call them cruel stepmothers
who having according to nature
brought their children forth into the world
&amp; because they will not take a little pains to nourish them themselves
they send them to sorry villages to be nursed of strange &amp; unknown nurses
which oftentimes do change their children &amp; bring home others in their stead
yet for all this they will not be ashamed to hold a little dog in their arms rather than the fruit that was engendered in their wombs
this inhuman practice is not used amongst beasts be they never so brutish
for their natures are such
that they never put their young ones in the keeping of others
though nature give them never so many
but they nourish them themselves
and are such zealous protectors of their young ones
that they keep them almost always in their presence
till such time as they can avoid danger
and that which is more to be marvelled at
there riseth a certain strife between the male and the female
which of them shall be the keeper
and for that intent they many time &apos;s quarrel and fight one with another
the which may be seen not only in apes
but also in bears
which in nature are fierce and cruel
yet they have so great affection to their young ones
that they are not only content to nourish them with their milk
but as soon as they are brought forth
having almost no form or fashion
they lick them and polish them to make them more perfect
likewise the little birds
covering five or six under their wings
&amp; having neither grain nor other seed for their sustenance
notwithstanding they spare neither art nor diligence
wherewith nature hath endued them
for their nourishment
it is therefore a true witness of humane misery
in that children are forced against nature
to suck the milk of a strange woman
and many times of such a one as may been found best cheap
what corruption or deformity soever she have
the which many times is so contagious to their children
that it were better for them to be nourished by some bruit beast in the wilderness
than to be put into the custody of such a nurse
as for example
the cruelty and infamous life of caligula the fourth emperor of rome
was not imputed to father or mother
but to the nurse that gave him suck
which woman was so cruel and barbarous of her self
that she rubbed the nipples of her breasts with blood
causing the child to whom she gave milk
to suck them
the which thing was so well practised of him
that he did not only commit an infinite number of murvers
but many time licked his sword and dagger being bathed and stained in blood
and wished that all the world had but one head
to the end that with one blow he might behead them
and then reign alone upon the earth
seeing then that the child hath not felt or suffered sorrow enough in his mother &apos;s womb
but as soon as he is borne
there is prepared a new sorrow for him by the ingratitude of such mothers which are so delicate and tender of themselves
that they will not nourish them
but cause them to suck the milk of those that oftentimes do change their fruit
or else feed them with corrupted milk
by the which means in process of time
there riseth a number of diseases
to the great hurt of poor children
&amp; continual reproach of their mothers
this is of a truth and often verified
that if the nurse be froward
the child will be froward
not by receiving of their milk
but by often looking upon it
if she be a drunkard
she will cause the child to be the like
as it is read in the life of the emperor tiberius
who was a great drunkard
for that the nurse the gave him suck
did not only drink unmeasurably
but also did feed the child with sops tempered in wine
here you may see that the nurses have so much power as to form the manners and body of the child
so that if she be sickly
she rendereth the child sickness
if she be wicked
she causeth the child also to be wicked
but here i will leave children in their nurses keeping
and speak of their following calamities
in how many dangers be they wrapped whilst they be a nursing
some will burst with crying
some never rest in quiet all the night long
so that their nurses can take no sleep
some when they can scant go
will fall and break their faces
and their limbs
so that many times there is seen about them many grievous wounds
besides the diseases which they take by nature
but who will not wonder to see the fantastical manners of little children
who for the most part will dabble in the water and channels like a little duck
making little houses of earth
counterfeiting the horsemen in riding on a little stick
running after dogs and cats
and will be angry with some
and pleased with others
who would think that such a miserable creature
by succession of time
would become so proud and lofty
therefore if we will consider it
we have just cause to mourn at their births
and rejoice at their burials
if the prophet jeremy bewailed the captivity of the jews in babylon
if anchises lamented the destruction of proud troy
if the consul marcellus lamented the city of syracuse when he saw it on fire
and sallust the corruption of rome
we may well with so many men of fame
bewail the miserable entry that man maketh into this world
his dangerous advancement
and sorrowful departure
all which being profoundly considered by the prophet jeremy
in the 20
chapter
he bewaileth his birth
and murmureth against the knees that held him up
&amp; also the breasts that gave him suck
likewise the same prophet jeremy in the aforesaid chapter
considering that man is made of dust &amp; earth
conceived in sin
borne in pain
and at the last made a prey for worms
doth with that his mother &apos;s womb had served for his tomb
job in his fourteenth chapter
likewise setteth man out in his right colours
when he saith
man that is borne of a woman hath but a short time to live
and is full of misery
out of these words we may gather somewhat
for amongst all the creatures whom god hath created
there is none subject to more miseries than a woman
especially those that are fruitful and bear children
for they have scant a monthes rest in a whole year
but are continually overcome with sorrow
and fear
then he saith
having a short time to live
indeed what is more shorter than the life of man
unto whom in stopping his nose and his mouth
the life is gone
for his life is nothing but a blast of wind enclosed therein
i have read of many that have murmured against nature for giving long life to hearts and ravens
whose lives bring no profit
and unto man
king of all things upon earth
but a short life
although he knoweth how to employ his time
and yet the little time that he hath to live
is shortened by sleeps
dreams
sorrows and cares
therefore we may justly say
that man &apos;s life is full of misery and sorrow
chap
ij
of the misery of man entering into his youth
and years of discretion
ye have already heard discoursed and showed in order
what perils and dangers man hath at his first coming into the world
now therefore let us consider what he is when he is sprung up
and whether that there been an end of his miseries or no
of which
if we be equal judges
we shall find that he doth rather increase than decrease the miseries
for this is the time of man &apos;s life wherein nature doth rear against him a more furious combat
for his blood beginneth to rise
the flesh provoketh him to his own pleasure
the wicked world espieth him
the devil tempteth him
and his self-willed youthfulness leadeth him
so that it is impossible
but that he which is assailed with so many vices
and succoured of none
in the end is discomfited and overcome
for in the body of youth
riot
liberty and deliciousness aboundeth
for all the uices in the world
saith marcus aurelius
do there plant their siege
therefore it behooveth when the trees are young
to uphold them
and to lop the over-weighty branches
if afterward ye intent to gather any fruit
likewise it is necessary to reform and correct the uices that reign in youth
lest afterward it return to the parents shame and reproach
but there are at this day
many fathers and mothers
which for default not to have well instructed their children in their youth
do receive much sorrow and grief in their age
moreover
there are many mothers
which in stead of giving them good and godly instructions
nourish and bring them up in voluptuousness and pride
and although they be nourishers of their bodies
so are they destroyers of their souls
if hely was grieevously punished with his children
for that he did not so sharply chastise them as their offences did require
what shall become of these fathers and mothers
which in stead of correctors
are their children &apos;s corruptors
such parents may well be compared to apes
which kill their young ones by too much straining them between their arms
and keeping them so dear
and this is the cause that so many fall into the hands of the hangman
which are to them
reformers and correctors
many there be that in stead of giving good exhortations to their family
do show them first themselves naughty and wicked examples
for the first commandment that they give them how to live well
is to blaspheme
swear
exercise gluttony
and drunkenness
to spoil the substance of their youth
to be fornicators
and to kiss women and maidens in their presence
there be also many mothers here in england
that learn their daughters to dance
to use rhetoric terms
to haunt companies
to scoff and flout
to paint and colour their faces
to deck their fingers with rings
and their necks with jewels
as though they were jewel sellers
pretending to keep a shop
but in the end it will happen to them as it did to the prophet david
2 king
13
&amp; 15
whose sin was punished in his children
which were most of them so wicked
that the one of them deflowered his own sister
and the other killed his brother
and afterward sought the death of his own father
and chased him out of his kingdom
the ancient philosophers maintained this argument
that all sins committed in this world
were punished in the world to come
except the sin that man committeth in the bringing up of his children
and for that
he suffereth punishment in this world
for the father can give nothing to his child but frail and mortal flesh
by the corruption whereof the life taketh end
but by good learning &amp; knowledge
eternal praise and memory is gotten
therefore to conclude
if that children have been in great misery
being nourished with spotted milk
yet the misery doubleth in those that should cause them to be instructed
for the food of the body is more vile than the food of the soul
but now when he is come to the seventh year of his age
it behooveth his parents to have tutors and schoolmasters for to instruct him in good learning
but growing further into years
and coming to his adolescency
it is needful then to have more rigorous reformers for to tame his wild youth
and to break him to labour
of the misery of man being come to his full strength
having finished this our second discourse
man is grown to his full perfection both of strength and discretion
in which time he entereth into deeper cogitations and travel in the spirit
it is requisite therefore
that he frequent public places
that he haunt the company of those that are as touchstones for to know the good from evil
if he be come of a great and a noble stock
he must make many enterprises of war
put himself in perils
hazard his life
and shed his blood for to die in the bed of honour
or else he shall be reputed a dastardly coward
and utterly despised of all men
if he be of bare estate
and that he be called to the knowledge of arts
sciences
and needful trades
yet for all that
he runneth into a thousand dangers
travels
pains and troubles
as well of the body as of the soul
he toileth day and night
and sweateth water and blood to get a maintenance during his life
and oftentimes it is seen that what pains soever man taketh for his living
yet it is scant sufficient to serve his necessity
it is not therefore without cause that marcus aurelius was wont to say
when he considered the misery of mankind
i mused in my mind
said he
whether there might be found in any age a man that could vaunt
that he never in all his life-time tasted adversity
and assuredly
if there might be such a one found
he would be such a fearful monster upon the earth
that all living things would be amazed to behold him
then he concluded after this sort
saying
and in the end i found mine own thoughts true
for he that was yesterday rich
was to day poor
he that was yesterday in health
was to day sick
he that laughed yesterday
to day did weep
he that was yesterday in prosperity
was to day in adversity
and he that was yesterday alive
was to day dead ▪ but let us now return to our former matter
and set down our discourses in order
what living man is he in all the world
that hath given himself to any science
or otherwise to live
but that at one time or other
he disliketh of his own profession
and is weary thereof
and for the better understanding of the same
we will particularly discourse the miseries
and troublesome lives of all the principal estates living upon the bosom of the sinful earth
chap
iu
of the misery of wicked kings
princes
and monarchs
searching into all estates of men
we shall find that fortune above all other mortal creatures
hath provided for kings most liberally
for what maketh man more happy in this world
than goods
honours
dignities
and rule
licence to do good or evil without controlment
power to exercise liberality
and all kind of pleasure
as well of the body as of the mind
all that may be wished for to the contentation of man
either in variety of meats
magnificence in service
or in vestures
to raise at their pleasure the meanest man to high place
and with a frown
disgrace the mightiest
all which continually is at a prince &apos;s command
there is nothing that may please the memory
or flatter the desires of the flesh
but is prepared for them even from their cradles
only to make their lives more happy and full of felicity
but now if we judge of their lives uprightly
and weigh them in a true balance
we shall find that the self same things which makes them happy in this world
are the very instruments of vice
and the cause of greater sorrows
for what availeth their costly ornaments
honourable services
and delicate meats
when that they are in continual fear to be poisoned
wrong seduced
and often beguiled by their servitors
have we not had experience thereof many times
doth not histories report
that some princes have been poisoned with papers
and with the smoke of torches
we may read likewise of certain emperors that dust not lie down to rest in the night
before they had caused their beds to be lain on
and all the corners of their chambers to be searched
lest they should be strangled or murdered in their sleeps
others that would not permit any barbers to touch their faces
for fear that in trimming of their heads or beards
they would cut their throats
and yet to this day they are in such fear
that they dare not put meat in their mouths before their taster have tasted thereof
what felicity can a king or prince have
that hath many thousands of men under their governments
when he must watch for all
hear the complaints and cries of every one
procure every man &apos;s safeguard
provoke some to do well by liberal gifts
and others by terror and fear
he must nourish peace amongst his subjects
and defend his realm against the invasion of foreign enemies
besides many other calamities that are depending upon a regal crown
but now touching the unhappy states of wicked princes
unto whom three kinds of people are most agreeable
and familiar
the first are flatterers
which been the chief enemies to all virtue
and they that impoison their souls with a poison so pestiferous
that it is contagious to all the world
their prince &apos;s folly
they call prudence
their cruelty
justice
their lechery
wantonness
their fornications ▪ pleasures and pastimes
if they be covetous
they call it good husbandry
if they be prodigal
they call it liberality
so that there is no vice in a prince
but they cloak it under the shadow of some virtue
the second sort are such
who never rest night
but that in the morning they bring in some new invention or other
how to tax and draw money from the poor people
and generally all their study is employed to been wasteful and prodigal in the exactions and miseries of the poor commons
the third and last sort are such
that under the cloak of kindness and honesty
counterfeiting good men
have always their eyes upon other men &apos;s livings
and make themselves reformers of vices
they invent wicked and false devices
not only how to get other men &apos;s goods
but oftentimes their lives
who before god are most innocent
behold
here you may well see the manifold miseries that compass sceptres and states of princes
here are the thorns that they receive in recompense of their brightness and royal dignity
which ought like a lamp to give light to all the world
but when it is eclipsed or darkened with any vice
it is more reproachful in them
than in any other private person whatsoever
for they sin not only in the fault which they commit
but also by the example that they give
the abundance of honours and pleasures that princes enjoy
serveth as a bait to induce them to evil
and are the very matches to give fire to vice
what was saul before he was made king ▪ whose life is showed in the holy scripture
whom god did elect
yet he made a sudden eclipse or changing
how wonderful was the beginning of the reign of king solomon
the which being overcome with royal pleasures
gave himself as a prey to women
of two and twenty kings of juda
there is found but five or six
that have continued in their virtue
if we consider the estate of the assyrians
persians
grecians and egyptians
we shall find more of them wicked than good
if we consider what the kings and roman emperors were
which hath been the most flourishing commonwealth in the world
we shall find them so overcome with vices
and all kind of cruelties
that i do almost abhors to speak of their corrupt &amp; defiled lives
what was the estate of their commonwealth
before that scylla &amp; marius did murmur against it
before that catiline and catulla did perturb it
before that caesar and pompey did slander it
before that augustus and marcus antonius did destroy it
before that tiberius and caligula did defame it
before that domitian and nero did deprave it
for although they made it rich with many kingdoms and lordships
yet were the vices they brought with them
more greater than the kingdoms they gained
for their goods and riches are consumed
yet their vices remain unto this day
what memory remaineth of romulus
that founded the city of rome
of numa pompilius
that erected the capitol
of ancus martius
that compassed it with walls
did not they show what felicity remaineth in high estates
who are more subject to the assaults of fortune
than any other earthly creature
for many times the thread of life breaketh
when they think least of death
and then the infamy of those that been wicked
remaineth written in histories
for a perpetual memory thereof
the which thing all estates ought more to regard a thousand times
than the tongue that speaketh evil
which can but shame the living
but books record a perpetual infamy for ever
which thing being duly considered of by many emperors and kings in times past
they forsook their sceptres
and royal empires
and betook them to an obscure life
resting better contented with a little in quiet
than to enjoy with full sail the crooked honours of the world
chap
v
of the misery of vicious courtiers
and of their wicked lives
what greater felicity can there been in this world
than to been in a prince &apos;s favour
to be at his elbow at all times
to use courtly manners
and other offices of humanity
of which number
there be some so subtle &amp; crafty
that they do play as the fisherman
who as soon as he hath gotten any thing in his net
giveth over the court
and goeth his way
othersome there are
that play all out
and other that remain until they become wondrous rich
and in the end
they are made to restore all back again
there are also others that do nothing but invent means to enlarge their treasures
and become wealthy with spoiling poor people
princes do by them many times
as we do by our hogs
we let them fatten to the end we may eat them afterward
so likewise are they suffered many times
to enrich themselves
to be disposed of afterward when they are fat
and one that is new come
oftentimes is preferred in their places
by this you may see that courtiers oftentimes do sell their liberty to become rich
for they must obey all commandments
they must frame themselves to laugh when the prince laugheth
to weep when he weepeth
approve that which he approveth
and condemn that which he condemneth
they must alter and change their natures
to be severe with those that are severe
sorrowful with those that are sorrowful
and in a manner transform themselves
according to the nature of him whom they will please
or else he shall get nothing
to be brief
they must frame themselves
to his manners and nature
and yet many times one little offence staineth all the service they have done in their life time before
many in princes courts put off their caps to them
whom they would gladly see cut shorter by the head
and often bow their knees to do them reverence
whom they wish had broken their necks
here you may see ▪ the life of a great number of vicious courtiers
which is no life
but rather a lingering death
here you may see wherein their youth is employed
which is no youth
but a transitory death
for when they come to age
they bring nothing from thence but grey heads
their feet full of gouts
their backs full of pain
their hearts full of sorrow
and their souls filled with sin
chap
vj
of the misery of magistrates
that administer not true justice
with a discourse against wicked judges
now our discourse of courtiers being past
it is requisite that we speak of things done in the civil life
and to how many miseries it is subject
for although it be at this day a degree most noble and necessary for the peace of man &apos;s life
yet shall we find that it deserves to have his part in this pilgrimage
as well as others
and if there be any delectation
pleasure
or honour
depending thereon
yet it is transitory and unconstant
first
knowing that all the actions of magistrates
pass before the eyes of the common people
whose judgements in matters of state be but simple
yet have they a certain smell or savour to know the good from evil
wherefore those that be judges and magistrates
be subject
as in a play
to be hissed at and chased away with shame and confusion
for the harebrained people
which is compared to a monster with many heads
are mutable
uncertain
fraudulent
apt to wrath and mutiny
ready to praise or dispraise
without wisdom or discretion
variable in their talk
unlearned and obstinate
therefore it behooveth that the life of a judge or magistrate be sincere and virtuous
for as he judgeth openly
so shall he be judged of the people severally ▪ not only in matters of weight and importance
but in those of small consequence
for always the rude people will find somewhat to reform
as the lacedæmonians murmured at their lawmaker lycurgus
for that he went always holding down his head
the venetians defamed wise cato in his eating
and accounted pompeius uncivil
for that he would scratch with one finger only
yet these are but few in comparison of other good men that the common sort have persecuted
banished
and in the end put to death
if that great orator demosthenes were alive
he could say some what
who after he had a long time been a just and faithful governor of the commonwealth of athens
was in the end
without cause
unjustly banished
moses
and many other holy men have so many times tasted the fury of the common people
that if they were this day living
they would pour out most grievous complaints against them
now we have showed and set forth the miseries that proceed from common people
so must we in like sort put into the balance the errors and corruptions that are found in wicked judges
of the which sort some are corrupted with fear
for such fear they have
that rather than they will displease a prince or a great lord
they will violate justice like pilate
that condemned christ
for fear that he had to displease the emperor tiberius
other magistrates are corrupted by love
as was herod
who for to please the foolish love of a damsel that danced
condemned to death saint john baptist
although he knew he was just and innocent
some are many times corrupted by hatred
as was the chief priest
that condemned saint paul to be stoned to death
though he deserved it not
some magistrates are corrupted by silver and gold
and other gifts and presents
as were the children of the prophet samuel
and this disease is so contagious
that i fear
at this day
many are infected with it
they all love rewards saith the prophet
they all seek for gifts
they do not right to the orphan
and the widow &apos;s complaint cometh not before them
and in an other place
woe be to you that are corrupted by money
by hatred or love
and which judge the good to be evil
and the evil good
making the light darkness
and the darkness light
woe be to you that have not respect to the deserts of things
but to the deserts of men
that regard not equity
but gifts that are given
that regard not justice
but money
you are diligent in rich men &apos;s causes
but you defer the cause of the poor
you are to them most cruel and rigorous judges
but unto the rich kind and tractable
the prophet jeremy cryeth out against wicked judges
and saith
they are magnified
and become rich
they have left the orphans
and have not done justice for the poor
shall not
i therefore punish these things
saith the lord
and my soul take vengeance on such manner of people ▪ hear also the sentence that saint james pronounceth against them at the day of judgement
you have condemned and killed the just
you have lived in wantonness in this world
and taken your ease
now therefore
saith the lord of hosts
weep and howl in your wretchedness that shall come upon you
your garments are moth-eaten
your gold and silver is cankered
and the rust thereof shall be a witness against you
and it shall eat your flesh as it were fire
for the complaints of the poor are ascended up to my throne
these are the complaints that the prophets and apostles made against wicked judges and magistrates
and likewise the censures that our good god hath thundred against them
and now i will speak of the misery of marriage
with a discourse of the same
of the praise of marriage
and likewise the miseries that ensue thereon
there is no joy nor pleasure in the world
which may be compared to marriage
for there is such fellowship between the parties coupled
that they seem two minds to be transformed into one
likewise both good fortune and bad
is common to both
their cares equal
and their joys equal
and to be brief
all things are in common between them two
if we account it pleasure to commit our secrets to our friends and neighbours
how much greater is the joy
when we may discover our thoughts to her
that is joined to us by such a knot of affinity
that we put as much trust in her as in our selves
making her wholly treasurer or faithful keeper of the secrets of our minds
what greater witness of fervent love and undissoluble amity can there be
than to forsake father
mother
sister and brother
and generally all their kindred
till they become enemy to themselves
for to follow a husband
that doth honour and reverence her
and having all other things in disdain
she only cleaveth to him
if he be rich
she keepeth his goods
if he be poor
she is companion with him in poverty
if he be in prosperity
his felicity is redoubled in her
if he be in adversity
he beareth but the one half of the grief
and furthermore
she comforteth him
assisteth and serveth him
if a man will remain solitary in his house
his wife keepeth him company
if he will go into the fields
she conducteth him with her eye as far as she can see him
she desireth and honoureth him
being absent
she complaineth and sigheth
and wisheth his company
being come home he is welcomed
and received with the best show and tokens of love
and for to speak truth it seemeth that a wife is a gift from heaven granted to a man
as well for the contentation of youth
as the rest and solace of age
nature can give us but one father
and one mother
but marriage presenteth many in our children
the which do reverence and honour us
and are more dear unto us than our own selves
for
being young
they play
prattle
laugh and show us many pretty toys
they prepare us an infinite number of pleasures
and it seemeth that they are given us by nature
to pass away part of our miserable life
if we be afflicted with age
they show the duty of children
close up one eyes
and bring us to the earth
from whence we came
they are our bones
our flesh and blood
for in seeing them
we see our selves
the father beholding his children
may be well assured that he seeth their lively youth renewed in their faces
in whom we are almost regenerate and borne again
in such sort
that age is most grievous unto us
beholding the mirrors and similitudes of our selves
the which doth make our memories almost immortal
many are the joys and sweet pleasures in marriage
which for brevity &apos;s sake i pass over
but if we do well consider it
and weigh it in a just balance
we shall find that amongst these roses
are many thorns growing
and amongst these sweet showers of rain
we shall find that there falleth much hail
but with reverence now i crave pardon of all virtuous women
that with patience i may discover my intent
and that my presumption may not gain the least frown from their chaste brows
for to the vicious i speak
and not to them whose breasts harbours the liberal fountain of virtue and wisdom
the athenians
being a people much commended for their prudence and wisdom
seeing that husbands and wives could not agree
because of an infinite number of dissensions that chanced between them
were constrained to ordain certain magistrates in their country
whom they called reconcilers of married ones
the office of whom was to set agreement between the husband and the wife
the spartans and romans had also such like laws and orders amongst them
so great was the insolence and rashness of some women towards their husbands
in this age there are but few i think
can bear patiently the charges of marriage
or can endure the unbridled rage of some women
and to speak truth without flattery
if thou takest her rich
thou makest thy self a bondslave
for thinking to marry thine equal
thou marriest a commanding mistress
if thou takest her foul
thou canst not love her
if thou takest her fair
it is an image at thy gate to bring thee company
beauty is a tower that is assailed of all the world
&amp; therefore it is a hard thing to keep that
where every one seeketh to have the key
then this is the conclusion
riches causes a woman to be proud
beauty maketh her suspected
and hard favour causeth her to be hated
therefore hyponactes having tasted the martyrdoms of marriage
said that there was but two good days in all the life of marriage
whereof the one was the wedding day upon which is made good cheer
the bride fresh and fair
and of all pleasures the beginning is most delectable
the other good day is when the woman dieth
for then the husband is out of bondage and thraldom
yet for all this a woman is to man a necessary evil
and one whom he cannot well live without
seeing that there is nothing more harder to find in this world
than a good woman
a good mule
and a good goat
who are three unhappy beasts
and to conclude
there is nothing more lighter than a woman &apos;s tongue
unbridled
more piercing than her outrageous words
more to be feared
than her boldness
more cruel
than her malice
nor more dangerous than her fury
besides many other hurtful discommodities of their housewifery
which for this time i pass over
and so return to our former discourse
of the world &apos;s general misery
and the vices of all sorts in the communality
of all the miseries that happeneth to man in this pilgrimage of woe
these hereafter following
are the greatest
of which nature her self hath complained unto god
who saith
that man for every vice hath a cloak of virtue to cover it
as for example
those that wound and kill one another
we call them hardy and strong
and we say that they have a regard to honour
and therefore deserve commendation
they that violate women
and ravish virgins
we call that bearing of love
those that are proud
and seek by all unlawful means to climb up to high dignities
we call them honourable
grave
and men of ripe judgement
those that are covetous
and beguile their neighbours by crafty subtleties and inventions
and so in short time become rich
those they call good husbands
and men that will seek to live
besides many other vices which are shadowed under the mantle of virtue
the which is one principal cause that so many miseries do fall upon the world
and to speak truth
the whole earth is drowned in sin
that it seemeth to be the sink wherein all the wickedness of the former age hath been emptied
who ever saw the sin of covetousness more deeper rooted in the world
than at this present day
for all the cities
provinces and kingdoms of the earth
be very shops and storehouses of covetousness and avarice
this is the world which the prophets did foreshow
that men join house to house
and land to land
as though themselves would alone dwell upon the earth
covetousness is the well spring of miseries
for from thence proceeds war and destruction
and the great effusion of blood
with the which the earth is overflown
from covetousness proceed murders
treasons
thefts
usuries
forswearing
the corruption of witnesses
and perverting of judgements
from covetousness the tedious delays in law
and linger of suits do proceed
and to be short
from thence cometh all wickedness
this grievous sin is grown so familiar amongst men
that many live without mercy
in such sort that now we may see the streets full of poor beggars
naked and clad with poverty
with an infinite number of banished women
driven out of their countries
bearing their children in their arms
wanting that which covetous men hoard up with such cares
that they make it their god
and will rather let a poor body dye at their gates
than refresh him with food
therefore let us now leave these wicked men
idolaters of their treasures
with the covetous rich man mentioned in the holy scripture
and speak of an other vice which is called envy
the malady wherewith many minds in this new world
is grievously afflicted
the time is now come
that the whole earth is nothing but a very place of the envious
a vice which is the oldest of all vices
&amp; hath been used in the world &apos;s infancy
the experience thereof was approved in the first age of adam and the serpent
in abel and cain
in jacob and esau
in joseph and his brethren
in saul and david
in hammon and mardocheus
the which pursued not one another for their riches
but for the envy that the one bore to the other
but all this is nothing to the envy which is used amongst men at this day
which wicked vice
not only reigneth amongst the common sort
but also amongst the higher
for when they are mounted to the top of fortune &apos;s wheel
and think peaceably to enjoy the favour of princes
behold suddenly the envy of some other
conspires against them
and causeth them to be disdained
&amp; cast out of favour
therefore i think there is no other means for to avoid envy
but to avoid dignity and rule
the reason is
that we are the children of envy
and he that leaveth most goods
leaveth most envy
for this cause the elders counselled the rich
that they should not dwell near the poor
nor the poor near the rich
for the one are envied for their wealth
and the other for their poverty
here will we now leave this grievous sin of envy
and a little glance at the ambitious pride
that reigneth amongst us
who ever saw such excessive pride in all estates
as we see at this present
whereby we may well name this world
a world of glistering gold
of silver
and velvet
of purple
of silk
with the which we deck our bodies curiously
and have no regard of the sins that overload the souls
but let us beware that the same happen not to us
which the prophets writ against the women of jerusalem
who reproved their pride
their unshamefull looks
their rolling eyes
their attires
their chains
jewels and bracelets
and other their vainglorious fashions
it will happen to you
saith the lord of hosts
that in stead of perfumes
you shall have stink
in stead of curled hair
baldness
and the fairest young men amongst you shall pass through the edge of the sword
and the strongest shall be slain
and perish in the wars
many other vices could i largely discourse of
as the sin of gluttony and drunkenness
where with the whole earth is infected
and i greatly marvel
that many unsatiable belly-gods do not rot and burst in the midst of their riotous excess
that will sit bousing in taverns
spoiling that which might comfort many succourless people
and in the mean time
the poor lazarus standeth at the gate
&amp; cannot have so much as the crumbs that fall from their table
and to conclude
these wicked vices of gluttony &amp; drunkenness hath continued upon the earth ever since the beginning of the world
as for example
the liquorous lusting of adam and eve
was the cause that the gate of paradise was shut up against us
esau sold his birthright
saint john baptist was slain after herod had banqueted
noah being overcome with wine
slept with his privy parts uncovered
and was mocked of his children

which for this time i pass over
and now i will discourse of other miseries and calamities belonging to man &apos;s woeful pilgrimage
chap
ix
of the misery of age
and of man &apos;s death
with his resurrection
and the terrible judgement of god at the latter day
thus after man hath waded in a sea of misery
as it were therein overwhelmed even from his birth
at last
age comes creeping on
and then
when he ought to rest
griefs and dolours are renewed
the heart afflicted
the brain troubled
the face withered
the body crooked
the sight dimmed
the hairs falling
the teeth rotten
and
to be short
the body is then
as it were a similitude of death
for in age man is wonderfully changed
he is prompt to wrath
hard to appease
sad
covetous and suspicious
the which being well considered by the emperor augustus
said
that man
till fifty years
lived in pleasure and felicity
and he that liveth longer for the most part
passeth his time in sorrow and grievous sickness
death of children
loss of goods
to bury his friends
with an infinite number of other worldly troubles
so that it were better to have their eyes closed in youth
than to live to behold these things in their crooked age
thus after man hath sorrowed all his days under the heavy burden of his sins
he is forced at last
to yield unto death
yet by no means may he know after what manner he shall end his life
some there be that are forced to dye by hunger
others by thirst
others by fire
others by water
others by poison
others are smothered
others are torn in pieces by wild beasts
others devoured of the fowls of the air
others are made meat for fishes
and others for worms
yet for all this man knoweth not his end
and when he thinketh himself most at rest
he suddenly perisheth
what a dreadful sight is it to see him lying in bed
that is oppressed with the pains of death
what shaking
and changing of all the bands of nature will he make
the feet will become cold
the face pale
the eyes hollow
the lips and mouth to retire
the hands diminish
the tongue waxeth black
the teeth doth close
the breath faileth
the cold sweat appeareth by violence of sickness
all which is a certain token that nature is overcome
but now when it cometh to the last gasp
or at the sorrowful departure that the soul makes from his habitation
all the bands of nature are broken
beside
when the devil or wicked spirit is assured of our end
what furious assaults will he make against our souls
to bring us in despair of god &apos;s mercy
it is the hour when as satan doth his power to strive against god
for to hinder the salvation of mankind
and he is more boisterous in these latter days
for that he knoweth that his time is but short
and that the end of his kingdom is at hand
and therefore he is the more inflamed
for he never more tormenteth those whom he doth possess
than when he knoweth that he must depart
but now when man hath passed the bitter anguish of death
where is then become his glories
where are his pomps and triumphs
where is his voluptuousness and wantonness
where is his majesty
excellence and holiness
they are vanished as the shadow
and it is chanced to them
as to the garment that the worms have eaten
or as the wool that the moth hath devoured
let us behold man when he is in his grave
who ever saw a monster more hideous than the dead carcase of man
behold his excellence
majesty and dignity
covered with a lump of earth
here you may see him that was cherished
reverenced and honoured
even to kiss his hands and feet
by a sudden mutation
become a creature most abominable
and to them it happeneth
as solomon writeth in his book of wisdom
what hath it profited
saith he
the pride and great abundance of riches
all these things are passed
as is the arrow shot to the white
or as the smoke that is dispersed with the wind
let us therefore now leave the body of man resting in his grave
as in a bed for a season
and speak of his resurrection
and the judgement of god
which was so much feared of the prophet david
that he prayed god not to enter into judgement with his servant
being dead in this world
he must then appear before the judgement seat of god
with such a terror to those that consider it well
that there is no member but trembleth
it is the day that the lord will come like a tempest
when every one &apos;s heart shall fail them
and all the world shall be astonished
for even as the lightning that riseth in the east
and extendeth to the west
so shall the coming of the son of man be
tribulation then shall be so extreme and great
as the like hath not been since the beginning of the world
till now
nor never shall be the like
the sun shall be darkened
and the moon shall give no more light
the stars shall fall from heaven
and the waves of the sea shall rage
and men shall be amazed with fear
and the powers of heaven shall move
woe shall be in those days to them that are with child
and to them that give suck
for as it was in the days before the flood
they did eat and drink
marry
and were married
even unto the day that noah entered into the ark
and knew nothing till the flood came and took them all away
so shall the coming of the lord been
and then shall all kindreds of the earth mourn
and shall hide themselves in dens and caves
and in the mountains
and shall say unto them
fall upon us
and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne
blow out the trumpet
saith the prophet joel
that all such as dwell in the world may tremble at it
for the day of the lord cometh
and is hard at hand
a dark day
a gloomy day
yea and a stormy day
before him shall be a consuming fire
and behind him a burning flame
then the dead that are in their graves
shall rise and come forth
the bones
and the other parts shall find out their joints
for to join again together with the body
that the earth hath putrified and corrupted ▪ all those that the beasts and birds of the air hath devoured
all those that the sea hath swallowed up
all those that are invapored in the earth
and all those that the fire hath consumed
shall be reduced and brought to their former state
all the blood that thieves
pirates
murderers
tyrants
and false judges
have unjustly shed
shall then appear before the majesty of god
so that there shall not one drop of blood be lost
from the time of abel
that was the first slain of men
unto the last
so that there shall not one hair perish
if the uaile of the temple did break
the earth quake
the sun darken and change his brightness
for the wrong that was done to jesus christ being on the cross
although in nothing he did offend
what countenance may then poor sinners show
that have offended him an innumerable times
who then shall abide the shining brightness of god &apos;s majesty sitting upon his throne of glory
it is the dreadful hour when wicked monarchs
kings and princes
shall give account of their unlawful exactions that they have made upon their subjects
and of the blood that they have wrongfully spilt
it is the hour wherein merchants
and such as have traded in the circle of the world that have beguiled and sold by false weights and measures
shall render just account of the least fault that they have committed
it is the hour that covetous men and usurers
that have beguiled some
and undone others
shall pay themselves the cruel interests of that which they have ill gotten
it is the hour when magistrates and wicked judges that have corrupted
violated
and suspended justice
shall be countable for their corruption and iniquities
it is the very hour wherein widows
orphans
and other afflicted persons
shall make their complaints before god
of the wrong and oppression that hath been showed them
it is the hour wherein the wicked shall say
repenting in themselves
troubled with horrible fear
behold these which in times past we had in derision
infamy and reproach
are now accounted amongst the children of god
whose portion is amongst the saints
it is the hour wherein many foolish and dumb persons shall be more happier than the wise and eloquent
many shepherds and carters shall be preferred before philosophers
many beggars before rich princes and monarchs
and many simple and ignorant
before the witty and subtle

master basse his career
or the new hunting of the hare
to a new court tune
long ere the morn expects the return of apollo from the ocean queen
before the creak of the croe or the break of the day in the welkin is seen
mounted idelia cheerfully makes to the chase with his bugle clear
and nimbly bounds to the cry of the hounds and the music of his career
oft doth ha &apos; trace
through wood
park and chase
when he mounteth his steed aloft
oft he doth run beyond far his home
and deceiveth his pillow soft
oft he expects
yet still hath defects
for still he is crossed by the hare
but more often he bounds to the cry of his hounds
and doth thunder out his career
hercules &apos; hunted and spoilt the game
wheresoever he made his sport
adonis did hunt but was slain by the same
through juno &apos;s bad consort
did the heart over go
and he purged the forests there
when his horn did rebound
the noise to the hound
he did thunder out his career
now bonny bay with his foam waxeth grey
deep grace waxeth bay with blood
white lily tops doth send for their caps
black lady makes it good
sorrowful watte
her widow &apos;s estate
forgets these delights to hear
and nimbly bounds to the cry of the hound
and doth thunder out his career
hills with the heat of the gallopers sweat
revives their freezing tops
dales purple flowers
the spring from the showers
which down from the rowels drops
swains they repast
and strangers they hast
no neglect when our horns they hear
to see a fleet pack of hounds in a sheet
and the hunter in his career
thus he careers over the moors
or the meers
over deeps
over downs and day
till he hath won
the day from the sun
and the evening from the day
sports than he ends
and joyfully wends home to his cottage
where frankly he feasts both himself and his guests
and carowseth to his career
finis
the falconers hunting
to the tune of basse his career
early in the morn
when the night &apos; s overworn
and apollo with his golden beams
the daystar overtakes
and cynthia forsakes
to frolic with his silver streams
we with our delights
and the haggard in our flights
that afronts the celestial sphere
with lures and with trains
we gallop over the plains
to behold a canceclere
from the fist she goes
and her nimbly throws
to out fly the whistling wind
onward still again
over bush over plain
till her gelding gen faintly she finds
an upshot than she makes
till the clouds she overtakes
her ambition rests not there
but mounting still she flies
like a phoenix in the skies
and comes down with a canceclere
mounting in the sky
to the shape of a fire
like a spark of elemental fire
upward then she tends to make good her place amends
till the retriefe gives her desire
no swallow
nor dove
their clipping wings can move like her when i &apos; the clouds they appear
she comes down from above
like the thunderbolt of jove
both young and old prepare
to the sport that is so rare from their weary labour coming for to see
lifting up their eyes from the plains to the skies
where the wonders of the welkin &apos;s be
the spirits of the air in huddles do repair
the music of the bells for to hears
and quickly fly apart affrighted at the heart
when she stoops to the canceclere
the mallard with complaints in her golden feathers faints while the haggard with the coy disdain
triumphant in her prey
concludes the evening grey with a pleasant and a lovely gain
homeward than we wend
&amp; the twilight than we spend in discourse our delights to hear
we taste the quail we killed
and carouse in what is

the prologue at the black friars
where the bee can suck no honey
she leaveth her sting behind
and where the bear cannot find origanum to heal his grief
he blasteth all other leaves with his breath
we fear it is like to fare so with us
that seeing you cannot draw from our labours sweet content
you leave behind you a sour mislike
and with open reproach blame our good meanings
because you cannot reap your wonted mirths
our intent was at this time to move inward delight
not outward lightness
and to breed
if it might be soft smiling
not loud laughing
knowing it to the wise to be as great pleasure to hear counsel mixed with wit
as to the foolish to have sport mingled with rudeness
they were banished the theater at athens
and from rome hissed
that brought parasites on the stage with apish actions
or fools with uncivil habits
or courtesans with immodest words
we have endeavoured to be as far from unseemly speeches
to make your ears glow
as we hope you will be from unkind reports to make our cheeks blush
the griffyon never spreadeth her wings in the sun
when she hath any sick feathers
yet have we ventured to present out exercise before your judgements
when we know them full of weak matter
yielding rather our selves to the courtesy
which we have ever sound
then to the preciseness
which we ought to fear
the prologue at the court
the arabians being stuffed with perfumes
burn hemlock
a rank poison
&amp; in hybla being cloyed with honey
they account it dainty to feed on wax
your highness eyes
whom variety hath filled with fair shows
and whose ears pleasure hath possessed with rare sounds
will we trust at this time resemble the princely eagle
who fearing to surfeit on spices
stoopeth to bite on wormwood
we present no conceits nor wars
but deceits and loves
wherein the truth may excuse the plainness
the necessity
the length
the poetry
the bitterness
there is no needless point so small
which hath not his compass
nor hair so slender
which hath not his shadow
nor sport so simple
which hath not his shadow
nor sport so simple
which hath not show
whatsoever we present
whether it be tedious which we fear or toyish which we doubt sweet or sour
absolute or imperfect
or whatsoever
in all humbleness we all
&amp; i on knee for all
entreat
that your highness imagine your self to be in a deep dream
that staying the conclusion
in your rising your majesty vouchsafe but to say
and so you awaked

thou art a ferry-man
phao
yet a free man
possessing for riches content
and for honours quiet
thy thoughts are no higher than thy fortunes
nor thy desires greater than thy calling
who climbeth
standeth on glass
and falleth on thorn
thy heart &apos;s thirst is satisfied with thy hands thrift
and thy gentle labours in the day
turn to sweet slumbers in the night
as much doth it delight thee to rule thine oar in a calm stream
as it doth sapho to sway the sceptre in her brave court
envy never casteth her eye low
ambition pointeth always upward
and revenge barketh only at stars
thou farest delicately
if thou have a fare to buy any thing
thine angle is ready
when thine oar is idle
and as sweet is the fish which thou gettest in the river
as the fowl which other buy in the market
thou needst not fear poison in thy glass
nor treason in thy guard
the wind is thy greatest enemy
whose might is withstood with policy
o sweet life seldom found under a golden covert
often under a thatched cottage
but here cometh one
i will withdraw my self aside

venus
it is no less unseemly than unwholesome for venus
who is most honoured in prince &apos;s courts
to sojourn with vulcan in a smiths forge
where bellows blow in steed of sighs
dark smokes rise for sweet perfumes
&amp; for the panting of loving hearts
is only heard the beating of steeled hammers
unhappy venus
that carrying fire in thine own breast
thou shouldest dwell with fire in his forge
what doth vulcan all day but endeavour to be as crabbed in manners
as he is crooked in body
driving nails
when he should give kisses
and hammering hard armours
when he should sing sweet amours
it came by lot
not love
that i was linked with him
he gives thee bolts
cupid
in stead of arrows
fearing belike jealous fool that he is that if he should give thee an arrow head he should make himself a broad head
but come
we will to syracusa
where thy deity shall be shown

i will yoke the neck
that yet never bowed
at which
if jove repine
jove shall repent
sapho shall know
be she never so fair
that there is a venus
which can conquer
were she never so fortunate

he will devise some new shape to entertain her
venus

that she conquers affections
and sendeth love up and down upon errands
i am afraid she will yerk me

peevish boy
can mortal creatures resist that
which the immortal god &apos;s cannot redress
cupid
the gods are amorous and therefore willing to be pierced
venus
and she amiable
&amp; therefore must be pierced

i dare not
venus
draw thine arrow to the head
else i will make thee repent it at the heart
come away and behold the ferry boy ready to conduct us

canst thou devise any pastime
phao
if the wind be with me
i can angle

it will be pleasure for you to see me take pains

i like not fishing
yet was i borne of the sea

that caught such an one in the sea
venus
it was not with an angle
my boy
but with a net
phao
so was it said
that vulcan caught mars with venus
venus
didst thou hear so
it was some tale
phao
yea madam and that in the boat i did mean to make my tale
venus
it is not for a ferry man to talk of the god &apos;s loves
but to tell how thy father could dig
and thy mother spin

pandion
since your coming from the university to the court
from athens to syracusa
how do you feel your self altered either in humour or opinion
pandi
altered trachinus
i say no more
and shame that any should know so much
trachi
here you see as great virtue
far greater bravery
the action of that which you contemplate
sapho
fair by nature
by birth royal
learned by education by government politic
rich by peace
insomuch as it is hard to judge
whether she be more beautiful or wise
virtuous or fortunate
besides
do you not look on fair ladies in steed of good letters
and behold fair faces in stead of fine phrases
in universities virtues and vices are but shadowed in colours white and black
in courts showed to life good and bad
there
times past are read of in old books
times present set down by new devices
times to come conjectured at by aim
by prophesy
or chance here
are times in perfection
nor by devise
as fables
but in execution
as truths
believe me pandion
in athens you have but tombs
we in court the bodies
you the pictures of venus &amp; the wise goddesses
we the persons &amp; the virtues
what hath a scholar found out by study
that a courtier hath not found out by practice
simple are you that think to see more at the candle snuff
than the sun beams
to sail further in a little brook
then in the main ocean
to make a greater harvest by gleaning
then reaping
how say you pandion
is not all this true
pandi
trachinus
what would you more
all true
trach
cease then to lead thy life in a study
pinned with a few boards
and endeavour to be a courtier to live in embossed ruffs
pandi
a labour intolerable for pandion
trach
why
pandi
because it is harder to shape a life to dissemble
than to go forward with the liberty of truth
trach
why do you think in court any use to dissemble
pandi
do you know in court any that mean to live
trach
you have no reason for it
but an old report
pandi
report hath not always a blister on her tongue
trach
ay
but this is the court of sapho nature &apos;s miracle
which resembleth the tree salurus
whose root is fastened upon knotted steel
&amp; in whose top bud leaves of pure gold
pandi
yet hath salurus blasts
and water boughs
worms and caterpillars
trach
the virtue of the tree is not the cause
but the easterly wind
which is thought commonly to bring cankers and rottenness
pandi
nor the excellency of sapho the occasion
but the iniquity of flatterers
who always whisper in princes &apos; ears suspicion and sourness
trach
why
than you conclude with me
that sapho for virtue hath no copartner
pandi
yea
&amp; with the judgement of the world
that she is without comparison
trach
we will thither straight
pandi
i would i might return straight
trach
why
there you may live still
pandi
but not still
trach
how like you the ladies
are they not passing fair
pandi
mine eye drinketh neither the colour of wine nor women
trach
yet am i sure that in judgement you are not so severe
but that you can be content to allow of beauty by day or by night
pandi
when i behold beauty before the sun
his beams dim beauty
when by candle
beauty obscures torch light
so as no time i can judge
because at any time i cannot discern being in the sun a brightness to shadow beauty
and in beauty a glistering to extinguish light
trachi
scholarlike said
you flatter that
which you seem to mislike
and to disgrace that
which you most wonder at
but let us away
pandi
i follow
and you sir boy go to syracusa about by land
where you shall meet my stuff
pay for the carriage
and convey it to my lodging
trach
i think all your stuff are bundles of paper
but now must you learn to turn your library to a war drop
&amp; see whether your rapier hang better by your side
than the pen did in your ear

serves a great company of such cats

a square die in a page &apos;s pocket

molus you courtiers be mad fellows
we silly souls are only plodders at ergo
whose wits are clasped up with our books
&amp; so full of learning are we at home
that we scarce know good manners when we come abroad
cunning in nothing but in making small things great by figures
pulling on with the sweat of our studies a great shoe upon a little foot
burning out one candle in seeking for an other
raw worldlings in matters of substance passing wranglers about shadows
criti
then is it time lost to be a scholar
we pages are politians
for look what we hear our masters talk of
ye determine of
where we suspect
we undermine
and where we mislike for some particular grudge
there we pick quarrels for a general grief
nothing among us but in steed of good morrow
what news
we fall from cogging at dice to cog with states
&amp; so forward are mean men in those matters
that they would be cocks to tread down others
before they be chickens to rise themselves
youths are very forward to stroke their chins
though they have no beards
and to lie as loud as he that hath lived longest
molus these be the golden days

began to wax squeamish beneath
not unlike to asolis
which being made green by heavenly drops
shrinketh into the ground when there fall showers
or the syrian mud
which being made white chalk by the sun
never ceaseth rolling
till it lie in the shadow
he to sweet prayers added great promises
i either desirous to make trial of his power
or willing to prolong mine own life
caught up my handful of sand
consenting to his suit
if i might live as many years as there were grains
phoebus
for what cannot god &apos;s do
and what for love will they not do
granted my petition
and then i sigh and blush to tell the rest
i recalled my promise
phao
was not the god angry to see you unkind
syb
angry my boy
which was the cause that i was unfortunate
phao what revenge for such rigor used the gods
syb
none
but suffering us to live
and know we are no gods
sapho
i pray tell on
syb
i will having received long life by phoebus
&amp; rare beauty by nature
i thought all the year would have been may
that fresh colours would always continue
that time &amp; fortune could not wear out
what gods and nature had wrought up
not once imagining that white and read should return to black and yellow
the juniper
the longer it grew
the crookeder it waxed
or that in a face without blemish
there should come wrinkles without number
i did as you do
go with my glass
ravished with the pride of mine own beauty
&amp; you shall do as i do
loath to see a glass disdaining deformity
there was none that heard of my fault
but shunned my favour
insomuch as i stooped for age before i tasted of youth
sure to be long lived
uncertain to be beloved
gentlemen that used to sigh from their hearts for my sweet love
began to point with their fingers at my withered face
&amp; laughed to see the eyes
out of which fire seemed to sparkle
to be suckered being old with spectacles
this causeth me to withdraw my self to a solitary cave
where i must lead six hundred years in no less pensiveness of crabbed age
than grief of remembered youth
only this comfort
that being ceased to be fair
i study to be wise
wishing to be thought a grave matron
since i cannot return to be a young maid
phao is it not possible to die before you become so old
sybilla no more possible than to return as you are
to be so young
phao could not you settle your fancy upon any
or would not destiny suffer it
sybilla women willingly ascribe that to fortune
which wittingly was committed by frowardness
phao what will you have me do
sybilla take heed you do not as i did
make not too much of fading beauty
which is fair in the cradle
&amp; foul in the grave
resembling polyon
whose leaves are white in the morning
and blue before night
or anyta
which being a sweet flower at the rising of the sun
becometh a weed
if it be not plucked before the setting fair faces have no fruits
if they have no witnesses
when you shall behold over this tender flesh a tough skin
your eyes which were wont to glance on others faces to be sunk so hollow
that you can scarce look out of your own head
and when all your teeth shall wag as fast as your tongue
then will you repent the time which you cannot recall
and be enforced to bear what most you blame
lose not the pleasant time of your youth
than the which there is nothing swifter
nothing sweeter
beauty is a slippery good
which decreaseth whilst it is increasing
resembling the meddler
which in the moment of his full ripeness is known to be in a rottenness
whiles you look in the glass
it waxeth old with time
if on the sun parched with heat
if on the wind
blasted with cold
a great care to keep it
a short space to enjoy it
a sudden time to lose it
be not coy
when you are courted
fortune &apos;s wings are made of times feathers
which stay not whilst one may measure them
be affable and courteous in youth
that you may be honoured in age
roses that lose their colours
keep their savours
and plucked from the stalk
are put to the still
cotonea
because it boweth when the sun riseth
is sweetest
when it is oldest
and children
which in their tender years sow courtesy
shall in their declining states reap pity
be not proud of beauties painting whose colours consume themselves
because they are beauties painting
phao i am driven by your counsel into diverse conceits
neither knowing how to stand
or where to fall
but to yield to love is the only thing i hate
sybilla i commit you to fortune
who is like to play such pranks with you
as your tender years can scarce bear
nor your green wits understand
but repair unto me often
and if i cannot remove the effects
yet i will manifest the causes
phao i go
ready to return for advice
before i am resolved to adventure
sybilla yet harken two words
thou shalt get friendship by dissembling
love by hatred
unless thou perish
thou shalt perish
in digging for a stone
thou shalt reach a star
thou shalt be hated most
because thou art loved most
thy death shall be feared &amp; wished
so much for prophecy
which nothing can prevent
and this for counsel
which thou mayst follow
keep not company with ants
that have wings
nor talk with any
near the hill of a mole
where thou smellest the sweetness of serpent &apos;s breath
beware thou touch no part of the body
be not merry among those that put bugloss in their wine
and sugar in thine
if any talk of the eclipse of the sun
say thou never sawest it
nourish no coneys in thy vaults
nor swallows in thine eves
sow next thy vine mandrake
and ever keep thine ears open
and thy mouth shut
thine eyes upward
and thy fingers down
so shalt thou do better than otherwise
though never so well as i wish
phao
alas madam
your prophesy threateneth miseries
and your counsel warneth impossibilities
sybilla farewell
i can answer no more

molus criticus comes in good time
i shall not be alone
what news criticus
cryti
i taught you that lesson
to ask what news
&amp; this is the news
to morrow there shall be a desperate fray between two
made at all weapons
from the brown bill to the bodkin
molus now thou talkest of frays
i pray thee what is that
whereof they talk so commonly in court
valour
the stab
the pistol
for the which every man that dareth is so much honoured
criti
o molus
beware of valour
he that can look big
and wear his dagger pommel lower than the point
that lieth at a good ward
and can hit a button with a thrust
and will into the field man to man for a bout or two
he
molus
is a shrewd fellow
and shall be well followed
molus what is the end
criti
danger or death
molus if it be but death that bringeth all this commendation
i account him as valiant that is killed with a surfeit
as with a sword
criti
how so
molus if i venture upon a full stomach to eat a rasher on the coals
a carbonado
drink a carouse
swallow all things that may procure sickness or death
am not i as valiant to die so in a house
as the other in a field
me thinks that epicures are as desperate as soldiers
and cooks provide as good weapons as cutlers
criti
o valiant knight
molus i will die for it
what greater valour
criti
scholars fight
who rather seek to choke their stomachs
then see their blood
molus i will stand upon this point
if it be valour to dare die
he is valiant howsoever he dieth
criti
well
of this hereafter but here cometh calipho
we will have some sport
caly
my mistress
i think hath got a gadfly
never at home
and yet none can tell where abroad
my master was a wise man
when he matched with such a woman
when she comes in
we must put out the fire
because of the smoke
hang up our hammers because of the noise
and do no work
but watch
what she wanteth
she is fair
but by my troth i doubt of her honesty
i must seek her
that i fear mars hath found
criti
whom dost thou seek
caly
i have found those i seek not
molus i hope you have found those
which are honest
caly
it may be
but i seek no such
molus criticus
you shall see me by learning to prove calipho to be the devil
cryti
let us see but i pray thee prove it better
than thou didst thy self to be valiant
molus calipho
i will prove thee to be the devil
caly
then will i swear thee to be a god
molus the devil is black
caly
what care i
molus thou art black
caly
what care you
molus therefore thou art the devil
caly
i deny that
molus it is the conclusion
thou must not deny it
caly
in spite of all conclusions
i will deny it
criti
molus
the smith holds you hard
molus thou seest he hath no reason
criti
try him again
molus i will reason with thee now from a place
caly
i mean to answer you in no other place
molus like master
like man
caly
it may be
molus but thy master hath horns
caly
and so mayst thou
molus therefore thou hast horns
and ergo a devil
caly
be they all devils have horns
molus all men that have horns
are
caly
then are there more devils on earth than in hell
molus but what dost thou answer
caly
i deny that
molus what
caly
whatsoever it is
that shall prove me a devil
but hearest thou scholar
i am a plain fellow
and can fashion nothing but with the hammer
what wilt thou say
if i prove thee a smith
molus then will i say thou art a scholar
cryti
prove it calipho
and i will give thee a good colaphum
caly
i will prove it
or else
criti
or else what
caly
or else i will not prove it
thou art a smith
therefore thou art a smith
the conclusion
you say
must not be denied
&amp; therefore it is true
thou art a smith
molus ay
but i deny your antecedent
caly
ay
but you shall not
have i not touched him criticus
criti
you have both done learnedly
for as sure as he is a smith
thou art a devil
caly
and then he a devil
because a smith
for that it was his reason to make me a devil being a smith
molus there is no reasoning with these mechanical dolts
whose wits are in their hands
not in their heads
criti
be not choleric
you are wise
but let us take up this matter with a song
caly
i am content
my voice is as good as my reason
molus than shall we have sweet music
but come
i will not break of

far unfit for thy thoughts
unmeet for thy birth
thy fortune
thy years

unhappy
canst thou not be content to behold the sun
but thou must covet to build thy nest in the sun
doth sapho bewitch thee
whom all the ladies in sicily could not woo
yea
poor phao
the greatness of thy mind is far above the beauty of thy face
and the hardness of thy fortune beyond the bitterness of thy words
die phao
phao die
for there is no hope if thou be wise
nor safety
if thou be fortunate
ah phao
the more thou seekest to suppress those mounting affections
they soar the loftier
&amp; the more thou wrestlest with them the stronger they wax
not unlike unto a ball
which the harder it is thrown against the earth
the higher it boundeth into the air
or our sicilian stone
which groweth hardest by hammering
o divine love
and therefore divine
because love
whose deity no conceit can compass
and therefore no authority can constrain
as miraculous in working as mighty
&amp; no more to be suppressed then comprehended
how now phao
whether art thou carried
committing idolatry with that god
whom thou hast cause to blaspheme
o sapho
fair sapho peace miserable wretch
enjoy thy care in covert
we are willow in thy hat
and bay in thy heart
lead a lamb in thy hand
&amp; a fox in thy head
a dove on the back of thy hand
&amp; a sparrow in the palm
gold boileth best
when it bubbleth least
water runneth smoothest
where it is deepest
let thy love hang at thy heart &apos;s bottom
not at the tongue &apos;s brim
things untold
are undone
there can be no greater comfort
than to know much
nor any less labour
than to say nothing
but ah thy beauty sapho
thy beauty
beginnest thou to blab
i blab it phao
as long as thou blabbest her beauty
bees that die with honey
are buried with harmony
swans that end their lives with songs
are covered when they are dead
with flowers
and they that till their latter gasp commend beauty
shall be ever honoured with benefits
in these extremities i will go to none other oracle
than sibylla
whose old years have not been idle in these young attempts
&amp; whose sound advice may mitigate though the heavens cannot remove my miseries
o sapho
sweet sapho
sapho

i love sapho
sibylla
sapho
ah sapho
sibylla
syb
a short tale phao
and a sorrowful
it asketh pity rather than counsel
phao so it is sibylla
yet in those firm years me thinketh there should harbour such experience
as may defer
though not take away
my destiny
syb
it is hard to cure that by words
which cannot be eased by herbs
and yet if thou wilt take advice
be attentive
phao i have brought mine ears of purpose
and will hang at your mouth
till you have finished your discourse
syb
love
fair child
is to be governed by art
as thy boat by an oar
for fancy
though it cometh by hazard
is ruled by wisdom
if my precepts may persuade
and i pray thee let them persuade i would wish thee first to be diligent
for that women desire nothing more than to have their servants officious
be always in sight
but never slothful
flatter i mean
lie
little things catch light minds
and fancy is a worm
that feedeth first upon fennel
imagine with thy self all are to be won
otherwise mine advise were as unnecessary as thy labour
it is unpossible for the brittle metal of women to withstand the flattering attempts of men
only this
let them be asked
their sex requireth no less
their modesties are to be allowed so much
be prodigal in praises and promises
beauty must have a trumpet
&amp; pride a gift
peacocks never spread their feathers
but when they are flattered
&amp; gods are seldom pleased
if they be not bribed
there is none so foul
that thinketh not her self fair
in commending thou canst lose no labour
for of every one thou shalt be believed
o simple women
that are brought rather to believe what their ears hear of flattering men
then what their eyes see in true glasses
phao you digress only to make me believe
that women do so lightly believe
sybilla then to the purpose
choose such times to break thy suit
as thy lady is pleasant
the wooden horse entered troy
when the soldiers were quaffing
and penelope forsooth
whom fables make so coy
among the pots wrong her wooers by the fists
when she lowered on their faces
grapes are mind glasses
venus worketh in bacchus &apos; press
&amp; bloweth fire upon his liquor
when thou talkest with her
let thy speech be pleasant
but not incredible
choose such words as may as many may melt her mind
honey rankleth
when it is eaten for pleasure and fair words wound
when they are heard for love
write
and persist in writing
they read more than is written to them
&amp; write less than they think
in conceit study to be pleasant in attire brave
but not too curious
when she smileth laugh outright
if rise
stand up
if sit
lie down
loose all thy time to keep time with her
can you sing
show your cunning
can you dance
use your legs
can you play upon any instrument
practise your fingers to please her fancy
seek out qualities
if she seem at the first cruel
be not discouraged
i tell the a strange thing
women strive
because they would be overcome
force they call it
but such a welcome force they account it
that continually
they study to be enforced
to fair words join sweet kisses
which if they gently receive
i say no more
they will gently receive
but be not pinned always on her sleeves
strangers have green rushes
when daily guests are not worth a rush
look pale
and learn to be lean
that who so seeth thee
may say
the gentleman is in love
use no sorcery to hasten thy success
wit is a witch
ulysses was not fair
but wise
not cunning in charms
but sweet in speech
whose filed tongue made those enamoured that sought to have him enchanted
be not coy
bear
sooth
swear
die to please thy lady
these are rules for poor lovers
to others i am no mistress
he hath wit enough
that can give enough
dumb men are eloquent
if they be liberal
believe me great gifts are little gods
when thy mistress doth bend her brow
do not thou bend thy fist
camokes must be bowed with sleight
not strength
water to be trained with pipes
not stopped with sluices
fire to be quenched with dust
not with sword
if thou have a rival
be patient
art must wind him out not malice
time
not might
her change
and thy constancy
whatsoever she weareth
swear it becomes her
in thy louce be secret
venus &apos; coffers
though they be hollow
never sound
&amp; when they seem emptiest
they are fullest
old fool that i am
to do thee good
i begin to dote
&amp; counsel that
which i would have concealed
thus phao have i given thee certain regards
no rules
only to set thee in the way
not to bring thee home
phao ah sibylla
i pray go on
that i may glut my self in this science
syb
thou shalt not surfeit phao
whilst i diet thee
flies that die on the honey suckle become poison to bees
a little in love is a great deal
phao but all that can be said not enough
syb
white silver draweth black lines
and sweet words will breed sharp torments
phao what shall become of me
syb
go dare phao i go
phao
thou canst but die

as pine in base fortunes

sapho sola
ah impatient disease of love
and goddess of love thrice unpitiful
the eagle is never stricken with thunder
nor the olive with lightning and may great ladies be plagued with love
o venus
have i not strawed thine altars with sweet roses
kept thy swans in clear rivers
feed thy sparrows with ripe corn
&amp; harboured thy doves in fair houses
thy tortoise have i nourished under my fig tree
my chamber have i ceiled with thy cockleshells
&amp; dipped thy spung into the freshest waters
didst thou nurse me in my swaddling clouts with wholesome herbs
that i might perish in my flouting years by fancy
i perceive
but too late i perceive
and yet not too late
because at last
that strains are caught as well by stooping too low
as reaching too high
that eyes are bleared as soon with vapours that come from the earth
as with beams that proceed from the sun
love lodgeth sometimes in caves
&amp; thou phoebus
that in the pride of thy hair shinest all day in our horizon
at night dippest thy head in the ocean
resist it sapho
whilst it is yet tender
of acorns comes oaks
of drops floods
of sparks flames of atomies elements
but alas it fareth with me as with wasps
who feeding on serpents
make their stings more venomous
for glutting myself on the face of phao
i have made my desire more desperate
into the nest of an halcyon no bird can enter but the halcyon
and into the heart of so great a lady can any creep but a great lord
there is an herb not unlike unto my love which the further it groweth from the sea
the salter it is
and my desires the more they serve from reason
the more seem they reasonable
when phao cometh
what then
wilt thou open thy love
yea
no sapho
but staring in his face till thine eyes dazzle
and thy spirits faint
die before his face
than this shall be written on thy tomb
that though thy love were greater than wisdom could endure yet thine honour was such
as love could not violate

you think belike i could sleep if i did but see him
let him not come at all

let him come
do you hear
milet

it shall be done peace

my simples are in operation as my simplicity is
which if they do little good
assuredly they can do no harm
milet
were i sick
the very sight of thy fair face would drive me into a sound sleep
phao
indeed gentlewomen are so drowsy in their desires
that they can scarce hold up their eyes for love
milet
i mean the delight of beauty would so blind my senses
as i should be quickly rocked into a deep rest
phao
you women have an excuse for an advantage
which must be allowed
because only to you women it was allotted
milet
phao
thou art passing fair
&amp; able to draw a chaste eye not only to glance
but to gaze on thee
thy young years
thy quick wit
thy stayed desires are of force to control those which should command
phao
lady
i forgot to commend you first
and least i should have overslipped to praise you at all
you have brought in my beauty
which is simple
that in courtesy i might remember yours
which is singular
milet
you mistake of purpose
or misconster of malice
phao
i am as far from malice
as you from love
&amp; to mistake of purpose
were to mislike of peevishness
milet
as far as i from love
why
think you me so dull i cannot love
or so spiteful i will not
phao
neither lady
but how should men imagine women can love
when in their mouths there is nothing rifer
than in faith i do not love
milet
why
will you have women &apos;s love in their tongs
phao
yea
else do i think there is none in their hearts
milet
why
phao
because there was never any thing in the bottom of a woman &apos;s heart
that cometh not to her tongue &apos;s end

you are too young to cheapen love

sapho
what herbs have you brought phao
phao
such as will make you sleep madam
though they cannot make me slumber
sapho
why
how can you cure me
when you cannot remedy your self
phao
yes madam
the causes are contrary
for it is only a dryness in your brains
that keepeth you from rest
but
sapho
but what
phao
nothing
but mine is not so
sapho
nay
than i despair of help
if our disease be not all one
phao
i would our diseases were all one
sapho
it goes hard with the patient
when the physician is desperate
phao
yet medea made the everwaking dragon to snort
when she poor soul could not wink
sapho
medea was in love
&amp; nothing could cause her rest but jason

indeed i know no herb to make lovers sleep but hearts ease
which because it groweth so high
i cannot reach
for
sapho

phao
for such as love
sapho
it groweth very low
and i can never stoop to it that
phao
that what
sapho
that i may gather it
but why do you sight so phao phao
it is mine use madam
sapho
it will do you harm
and me too
for i never hear one sigh
but i must sight also
phao
it were best then that your ladyship give me leave to be gone
for i can but sigh
sapho
nay stay
for now i begin to sigh
i shall not leave
though you be gone
but what do you think best for your sighing to take it away
phao
yew madam
sapho
me
phao
no madam
yew of the tree
sapho
then will i love you the better
and indeed i think it would make me sleep too
therefore all other simples set aside
i will simply use only you

be not dismayed
phao shall yield

un happy venus
who in bestowing a benefit upon a man
hast brought a bane unto a goddess
what perplexities dost thou feel
o fair phao
and therefore made fair to breed in me a frenzy
o would that when i gave thee golden locks to curl thy head
i had shackled thee with iron locks on thy feet
and when i nursed thee sapho with lettuce
would it had turned to hemlock
have i brought a smooth skin over thy face to make a rough scar in my heart
and given thee a fresh colour like the damask rose
to make mine pale like the stained turkey
o cupid
thy flames with psyche &apos;s were but sparks
and my desires with adonis but dreams
in respect of these unacquainted torments
laugh juno
venus is in love
but juno shall not see with whom
lest she be in love
venus belike is become stale
sapho forsooth because she hath many virtues
therefore she must have all the favours
venus waxeth old
and then she was a pretty wench
when juno was a young wife
now crows foot is on her eye
and the black ox hath trod on her foot
but were sapho never so virtuous
doth she think to contend with venus to be as amorous
yield phao
but yield to me phao
i entreat where i may command
command thou
where thou shouldest entreat
in this case cupid what is thy counsel
venus must both play the lover &amp; the dissembler
&amp; therefore the dissembler
because the lover
cupid
you will ever be playing with arrows
like children with knives
&amp; then when you bleed
you cry
go to vulcan
entreat by prayers
threaten with blows
woo with kisses
ban with curses
try all means to rid these extremities
venus
to what end
cupid
that he might make me new arrows
for nothing can root out the desires of phao
but a new shaft of inconstancy
nor any thing turn sappho &apos;s
but a new arrow of disdain
and then they disliking one the other
who shall enjoy phao but venus
venus
i will follow thy counsel
for venus
though she be in her latter age for years
yet is she in her nonage for affections
when venus ceaseth to love
let love cease to rule

what dreams are these mileta
and can there be no truth in dreams
yea
dreams have their truth
me thought i saw a stock dove or woodquist
i know not how to term it
that brought short straws to build his nest in a tall cedar
where
whiles with his bill he was framing his building
he lost as many feathers from his wings
as he laid straws in his nest
yet scambling to catch hold to harbour in the house he had made
he suddenly fell from the bough where he stood
and then pitifully casting up his eyes
he cried in such terms as i imagined as might either condemn the nature of such a tree
or the daring of such a mind
whilst he lay quaking upon the ground
&amp; i gazing one the cedar
i might perceive ants to breed in the rind coveting only to hoard
&amp; caterpillars to cleave to the leaves
labouring only to suck
which caused more leaves to fall from the tree
then there did feathers before from the dove
me thought mileta
i sighed in my sleep
pitying both the fortune of the bird
&amp; the misfortune of the tree but in this time quills began to bud again in the bird
which made him look as though he would fly up
and then wished i that the body of the tree would bow
that he might but creep up the tree
then and so
heigh
ho
milet
and so what
sapho
nothing mileta
but
and so i waked
but did no body dream but i
milet
i dreamed last night
but i hope dreams are contrary
that holding my head over a sweet smoke
all my hair blazed on a bright flame
me thought ismena cast water to quench it
yet the sparks fell on my bosom
and wiping them away with my hand
i was all in a gore blood
till one with a few fresh flowers staunched it
and so stretching my self as stiff i started
it was but a dream
isme
it is a sign you shall fall in love with hearing fair words
water signifieth counsel
flowers death
and nothing can purge your loving humour but death
milet
you are no interpreter
but an interpreter
harping always upon love
till you be as blind as a harper
isme
i remember last night but one
i dreamed mine eye tooth was loose
&amp; that i thrust it out with my tongue
milet
it foretelleth the loss of a friend
and i ever thought thee so full of prattle
that thou wouldest thrust out the best friend with the tattling
isme
yea mileta
but it was loose before
and if my friend be loose
as good thrust out with plain words
as kept in with dissembling

i seldom dream madam
but sithence your sickness
i cannot tell whether with over watching but i have had many fantastical visions
for even now slumbering by your beds side
me thought i was shadowed with a cloud
where labouring to unwrap my self
i was more entangled
but in the midst of my striving
it seemed to myself gold
with fair drops
i filled my lap
and running to show it my fellows
it turned to dust
i blushed
they laughed and than i waked
being glad it was but a dream
isme
take heed canope
that gold tempt not your lap
and than you blush for shame
cano
it is good luck to dream of gold
isme
yea
if it had continued gold
lamya
i dream every night
and the last night this
me though that walking in the sun
i was stung with the fly tarantula
whose venom nothing can expel but the sweet consent of music
i tried all kind of instruments
but found no ease
till at the last two lutes tuned in one key
so glutted my thirsting ears
that my grief presently seized
for joy whereof as i was clapping my hands
your ladyship called
milet
it is a sign that nothing shall assuage your love but marriage
for such is the tying of two in wedlock
as is the tuning of two lutes
in one key
for striking the strings of the one
straws will stir upon the strings of the other
and in two minds linked in love
one cannot be delighted but the other rejoiceth
fauil
me thought going by the sea side among pebbles
i saw one playing with a round stone
ever throwing it into the water
when the sun shined
i asked the name
he said
it was called abeston
which being once hot
would never be cold
he gave it me
and vanished
i forgetting my self
delighted with the fair show
would always show it by candle light
pull it out in the sun
and see how bright it would look in the fire
where catching heat
nothing could cool it
for anger i threw it against the wall
and with the heaving up of mine arm i waked
milet
beware of love
favilla
for women hearts are such stones
which warmed by affection
cannot be cold by wisdom
fauil
i warrant you
for i never credit men &apos;s words
isme
yet be wary
for women are scorched sometimes with men &apos;s eyes
though they had rather consume than confess
sapho
cease your talking
for i would feign sleep
to see if i can dream
whether the bird hath feathers
or the aunt &apos;s wings
draw the curtain

who being

hath chosen thee of all the gods the most foul
thou must needs then confess i was most loving
inquire not the cause of my suit by questions
but prevent the effects by courtesy
make me six arrow heads
it is given thee of the gods by permission to frame them to any purpose
i shall request them by prayer
why lourest thou vulcan
wilt thou have a kiss
hold up thy head
venus hath young thoughts

roots have strings
when boughs have no leaves
but harken in thine ear vulcan
how sayest thou
vulc
vulcan is a god with you
when you are disposed to flatter
a right woman
whose tongue is like a bee &apos;s sting
which pricketh deepest
when it is fullest of honey
because you have made mine eyes drunk with fair looks
you will set mine ears on edge with sweet words
you were wont to say that the beating of hammers made your head ache
and the smoke of the forge your eyes water
and every coal was a block in your way
you weep rose water

and spit vinegar
when you have obtained
what would you now
with new arrows
belike mars hath a tougher skin one his heart

venus
come cupid
receive with thy father &apos;s instruments
thy mother &apos;s instructions
for thou must be wise in conceit
if thou wilt be fortunate in execution
this arrow is feathered with the wings of aegitus
which never sleepeth for fear of his hen
the head touched with the stone perillus
which causeth mistrust and jealousy
shoot this
cupid
at men that have fair wives
which will make them rub the brows
when they swell in the brains
this shaft is headed with lydian steel
which striketh a deep disdain of that which we most desire
the feathers are of turtle
but dipped in the blood of a tigress
draw this up close to the head at sapho
that she may despise
where now she dotes
good my boy
gall her on the side
that for phaos &apos; love she may never sigh
this arrow is feathered with the phoenix wing
and headed with the eagle &apos;s bill
it maketh men passionate in desires
in love constant
and wise in conveyance
melting as it were their fancies into faith
this arrow
sweet child
and with as great aim as thou canst
must phao be stricken withal
and cry softly to thy self in the very loose
venus
sweet cupid mistake me not
i will make a quiver for that by it self
the fourth hath feathers of the peacock
but glued with the gum of the myrtle tree
headed with fine gold
and fastened with brittle chrysocoll
this shoot at dainty and coy ladies
at amiable and young nymphs
choose no other white but women
for this will work liking in their minds
but not love affability in speech
but no faith
courtly favours
to be mistresses over many
but constant to none
sighs to be fetched from the longs
not the heart
and tears to be wrong out with their fingers
not their eyes
secret laughing at men &apos;s pale looks and neat attire
open rejoicing at their own comeliness and men &apos;s courting
shoot this arrow among the thickest of them
whose bosoms lie open
because they would be stricken with it
and seeing men term women jupiter &apos;s fools
women shall make men venus &apos; fools
this shaft is lead in the head
and whose feathers are of the night raven
a deadly and poisoned shaft
which breedeth hate only against those which sue for love
take heed cupid thou hit not phao with this shaft
for then shall venus perish
this last is an old arrow
but newly mended
the arrow which hit both sapho and phao
working only in mean minds an aspiring to superiors
&amp; in high estates a stooping to inferiors
with this cupid i am galled my self
till thou have galled phao with the other
cupid
i warrant you i will cause phao to languish in your love and sapho to disdain his
venus go
loiter not
nor mistake your shaft
now venus
hast thou played a cunning part
though not current
but why should venus dispute of unlawfulness in love
or faith in affection
being both the goddess of love and affection
knowing there is as little truth to be used in love
as there is reason
no
sweet phao
venus will obtain because she is venus
not thou jove with thunder in thy hand
shalt take him out of my hands
i have new arrows now for my boy
and fresh flames
at which the gods shall tremble
if they begin to trouble me

thy fair face deserved greater favours
i cannot love
venus hath hardened my heart

i will be sappho &apos;s son
i have as you commanded stricken her with a deep disdain of phao
and phao as she entreated me
with a great despite of you
venus
unhappy wag
what hast thou done
i will make thee repent it every vain in thy heart
sapho
venus be not choleric
cupid is mine
he hath given me his arrows
and i will give him a new bow to shoot in
you are not worthy to be the lady of love
that yield so often to the impressions of love
immodest venus
that to satisfy the unbridled thoughts of thy heart
transgressest so far from the stay of thine honour
how sayest thou cupid
wilt thou be with me
cupid
yes
sapho
shall not i be on earth the goddess of affections
cupid

shall not i rule the fancies of men

it is a good boy
venus
what have we here
you the goddess of love
and you her son
cupid
i will tame that proud heart
else shall the gods say
they are not venus friends
and as for you
sit boy
i will teach you how to run away
you shall be stripped from top to toe
and whipped with nettles
not roses
i will set you to blow vulcan &apos;s coals
not to bear venus &apos; quiver
i will handle you for this gear
well
i say no more
but as for the new mistress of love
or lady
i cry you mercy
i think you would be called a goddess
you shall know what it is to usurp the name of venus
i will pull those plumes
and cause you to cast your eyes on your feet
not your feathers
your soft hair will i turn to hard bristles
your tongue to a sting
and those alluring eyes to unluckiness
in which if the god &apos;s aid me not
i will curse the gods
sapho
venus
you are in a vain answerable to your vanity
whose high words neither become you
nor fear me
but let this suffice
i will keep cupid in despite of you
and yet with the content of the gods
venus
will you
why then we shall have pretty gods in heaven
when you take god &apos;s prisoners on earth
before i sleep you shall both repent
and find what it is but to think unreverently of venus
come cupid
she knows not how to use thee
come with me
you know what i have for you
will you not
cupid
not i
venus
well
i will be even with you both

i will direct thine arrows better
every rude ass shall not say he is in love
it is a toy made for ladies

cupid
but what will you do for phao
sapho
i will wish him fortunate
this will i do for phao

and yet hurt whilst they are seen
a ferry phao
no the stars cannot call it a worser fortune
range rather over the world
forswear affections
entreat for death
o sapho
thou hast cupid in thine arms
i in my heart
thou kissest him for sport
i must curse him for spite
yet will i not curse him sapho
whom thou kissest
this shall be my resolution
wherever i wander
to be as i were ever kneeling before sapho
my loyalty unspotted
though unrewarded
with as little malice will i go to my grave
as i did lie with all in my cradle
my life shall be spent in sighing and wishing
the one for my bad fortune
the other for sappho &apos;s good
sybil
do so phao
for destiny calleth thee as well from sicily as from love
other things hang over thy head
which i must neither tell
nor thou inquire
and so farewell
phao
farewell sibylla
and farewell sicily
thoughts shall be thy food
and in thy steps shall be printed behind thee
that there was none so loyal left behind thee
farewell syracusa
unworthy to harbour faith
and when i am gone
unless sapho be here
unlikely to harbour any
the epilogue
they that tread in a maze
walk oftentimes in one path
&amp; at the last come out where they entered in
we fear we have led you all this while in a labyrinth of conceits
diverse times hearing one device
&amp; have now brought you to an end
where we first began
which wearisome travail
you must impute to the necessity of the history
as theseus did his labour to the art of the labyrinth
there is nothing causeth such giddiness
as going in a wheel
neither can there any thing breed such tediousness
as hearing many words uttered in a small compass
but if you accept this dance of a fairy in a circle
we will hereafter at your wills frame our fingers to all forms
and so we wish every one of you a thread to lead you out of the doubts
wherewith we leave you entangled
that nothing be mistaken by our rash oversights
nor misconstrued by your deep insights

our mind soothly is the image of god or else thus the mind soothly is the image of god
wretchedness of man in his conceiving
the nobless of the soul and of the sudden mischief of wicked men
accusing by confession of diverse sins
of three ghostly enemies
of the bliss of heaven

yet they be not all faultless if the should be straightly judged
how many evil works we do by process of little time
and what good things we by our negligence leave undone
but suffer our mind to be occupied about trifles
it is also very hard to be much occupied in worldly things
there can no man judge and rebuke himself perfectly for he is so much occupied
he is smitten with sudden fear

all have been joyful of our lord whose countenance and cheer is meek
whose face is fair and beauteous
to follow perils of this world
and to be subject of the wicked tyranny of the devil and covet
to flee to the blessed company of saints and felicity of angels to the solmenity and feast of heavenly gladness
and to the joy and sweetness of contemplative life in the kingdom of our lord
the abundant riches of his goodness
we shall see the beauty of eternal glory and the most benign goodness of the holy trinity

strain the clearest through a linen cloth putting to it for every pot of water
half ounce of brasil scraping and let them seethe well in it
bet yet they must be boiled first in alum
to dye yellow take the bark of an apple tree
not the outward hard and rough bark
but the inward
cut it in small lupins
and pour some water upon them
and then put in your wood
bone or horn to it
with alum
and let it seethe well together
to dye black
take galls broken or bruised in pieces
and seethe them in strong vinegar and put your wood
bone
or horn
in it
and let all seethe well together in it
take them then out
and put them in white of eggs
putting to it juice of walnuts
and let them seethe well together to mollify horn so that you may imprint in it take the juice of white marrubium
and of alexanders
and of milfoil the juice of radish roots
the juice of celandine
and strong vinegar
mix all together
and put your horn into it well covered 7 days
together in a dunghill
and then knead it and work it as you did before to make clear stones of amber
seethe turpentine in a pan leaded
with a little cotton
stirring it until it be as thick as paste
and then pour it into what you will
and set it in the sun eight days
and it will be clear and hard enough
you may make of this little balls
hastes for knives
or such like
to make verdigris or spanish green
take brass of filed copper
sprinkle it with old piss and salt ammoniac
lay the copper upon a board in the sun
and when it is dry sprinkle it again till it wax green
thus is verdigris made
take copper beaten like a plate
make it clean
and bray some atramentum upon a stone with piss
and anoint the copper plate on every side
and let it dry in the sun
then put it in a pot leaded
and set it on the coals
and let it heat the space of 2 hours
and sometime open the pot above
and when you see black smoke come out of it
take the pot from the fire
and let it cool
and open the pot for to take out the copper plate
rubbing it into powder between your hands
and that which will not yet turn to powder
do it again in all things as you did before
until it may be made in powder
then wash it with hot water or piss in a basin
and let it stand still
for the copper will go to the bottom
and the atramentum will swim above
then pour it out
and dry the copper in the sun
this done
take of the said powder a pound
of tartar calcined 2 ounces
beat them together with child &apos;s piss
and let them dry
then put them in your pot

with a great fire until you see a green smoke come out of it
and then let it cool again
and open your pot
and you shall find it fair and green
to make lutum sapientiæ
take dry earth
and stamp it small
and sift it
and cast upon it
some wheat flower rank upon rank
and then the yolks of eggs and vinegar and mingle all together
then plaster or lute glasses
pots or limbecks with it
and dry them in the shadow
and they will never fail nor break in the fire
you may also mingle it with ox blood in stead of water
it is also good for that purpose to soften all metals
and other things that are not soft
so that they shall be soft and gentle to be wrought upon take mastic
frankincense
myrrh
borax
vernix
of each half ounce
make all into a powder together
and cast the bigness of two or three peas of it
upon the hard things
and they will be soft and tender
take what metal you will
heat it upon the coals
and quench it in the water of salt ammoniac
and it will be soft to take gilt from a cup that is gilded within take pyrethrum
and seethe it in strong vinegar
so that there may come no smoke nor breath go out of it
then pour it into a cup gilt within and the gold will go of
and go to the bottom
and there you shall have it to boil gold or silver to make it receive a fair colour
take tartar well brayed
and put some well water or rainwater to it
and that which you shall boil in it shall be fair to give a colour to gold take the hairs of a man to the bigness of a finger
and lay them upon quick coals

put it in a mortar of iron
and put to it some oil olive or oil of bays
this done set it on a small fire
and let it seethe therein
but take heed
that the smoke of it hurt you not
for it is unwholesome
put oftentimes some oil into it
and also strong vinegar distilled that it may boil in it
and by this means it will be mortified and killed
then take it out
for it is hard and will endure the hammer to white any vessel of copper with silver colour
take 2 parts of mercury
3 parts of tin
melt first the tin in a melting pot
and then put the mercury to it
stir it well together
and then pour it out and let it cool and stamp it well in a mortar till it be brought to powder
then take alum
and stamp it also in a mortar
and it will be like a white powder
which you shall lay upon a marble stone
garnished on the sides with potter &apos;s clay in a moist cave or seller
setting under it a glass
which may receive the alum dissolved into water
and when you will silver your vessel of copper
take the said water of alum
and anoint your vessel with it and let it dry
do thus three or 4 times
and leave it open that the bottom may be the better
then take the powder that you have made
and rub it upon it
and your vessel will be whiten
and seem as it were silver
the mother of all waters
to make all metals liquifiable
take a pound of salt nitrum
a pound of vitriol
stamp each of them by itself
and then mingle them together in a mortar
distill the said water
without adding any other water to it
take an ounce of the said water an ounce of wine not distilled

and they will burn of themselves
so that you may light a candle at them
it is also the mother of all colours
also take 3 ounces of the said water three ounces of mercury
the fourth part of quick brimstone
put them all together to dissolve in a glass
and when they be dissolved
let the smoke come out
and you shall find the mercury fixed very red
and so may you fix all the spiritus
if you will make this water altogether strong
add to the 7 parts of all these things aforesaid vitriol and saltpetre
a pound of each
and distill them
putting the water into a glass again
and it will be so strong
that it will break both iron and things made with forge
