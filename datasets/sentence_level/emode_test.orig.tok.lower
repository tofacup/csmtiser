primate of all england
and metropolitan
and to the most reverend father in god
our right trustie and welbeloved counceller
richard
by divine providence
lord arch-bishop of york
primate and metropolitan of england respectively directed
bearing date the twentieth day of februarie
in the fifteenth yeer of our reign
to appear before the said lord arch-bishop of canterburie in our cathedrall church of s
paul in london
and before the said lord arch-bishop of york
in the metropolitan church of s
peter in york the fourteenth day of april then next ensuing
or elswhere
as they respectively should think it most convenient to treat
consent and conclude
vpon certain difficult and urgent affairs contained in the said writs
did thereupon at the time appointed
and within the cathedrall church of st paul
and the metropolitan church of st peter aforesaid
assemble themselves respectively together
and appear in severall convocations for that purpose
according to the said severall writs
before the said lord arch-bishop of canterburie
and the said lord arch-bishop of york respectively
and forasmuch as we are given to understand
that many of our subjects being misled against the rites and ceremonies now used in the church of england
have lately taken offence at the same
upon an unjust supposall
that they are not onely contrary to our laws
but also introductive unto popish superstitions
whereas it well appeareth unto vs upon mature consideration
that the said rites and ceremonies which are now so much quarrelled at
were not onely approved of
and used by those learned and godly divines
to whom at the time of reformation under king edward the sixth
the compiling of the book of common prayer was committed divers of which suffered martyrdome in queen maries dayes
but also again taken up by this whole church under queen elizabeth
and so duely and ordinarily practised for a great part of her reign within the memory of divers yet living as that it could not then be imagined
that there would need any rule or law for the observation of the same
or that they could be thought to savour of popery
and albeit since those times
for want of an expresse rule therein
and by subtile practises
the said rites and ceremonies began to fall into disuse
and in place thereof
other forrain and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in
yet forasmuch as in our own royall chappels
and in many other churches
most of them have been ever constantly used and observed
we cannot now but be very sensible of this matter
and have cause to conceive that the authors and fomentors of these jealousies
though they colour the same with a pretence of zeal
and would seem to strike onely at some supposed iniquity in the said ceremonies
yet as we have cause to fear
ayme at our own royall person
and would fain have our good subiects imagine that we our self are perverted
and do worship god in a superstitious way
and that we intend to bring in some alteration of the religion here established
now how far we are from that
and how utterly we detest every thought therefore
we have by many publike declarations
and otherwise upon sundry occasions
given such assurance to the world
as that from thence we also assure our self
that no man of wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious entertainment to such brain-sick jealousies
and for the weaker sort
who are prone to be misled by crafty seducers
we rest no lesse confident
that even of them
as many as are of loyall
or indeed but of charitable hearts
will from henceforth utterly banish all such causlesse fears and surmises
upon these our sacred professions
so often made by vs
a christian defender of the faith
their king
and soveraign
and therefore if yet any person
under whatsoever mask of zeal or counterfeit holinesse
shall henceforth by speech or writing
or any other way notwithstanding these our right
hearty
faithfull
and solemn protestations made before him
whose deputy we are against all and every intention of any popish innovation be so ungracious and presumptuous as to vent any poisoned conceits
tending to such a purpose
and to cast these devilish aspersions and jealousies upon our royall and godly proceedings
we require all our loyall subjects
that they forthwith make the same known to some magistrate
ecclesiasticall or civill
and we straightly charge all ordinaries
and every other person in any authority under vs
as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perill
that they use no palliation
connivence
or delay therein
but that taking particular information of all the passages
they do forthwith certifie the same unto our court of commission for causes ecclesiasticall
to be there examined
and proceeded in with all fidelity and tendernesse of our royall majestie
as is due to vs their soveraigne lord and governour
but forasmuch as we well perceive that the misleaders of our well minded people
do make the more advantage for the nourishing of this distemper among them from hence
that the foresaid rites and ceremonies
or some of them
are now insisted upon but onely in some diocesses
and are not generally revived in all places
nor constantly and uniformly practised thorowout all the churches of our realm
and thereupon have been lyable to be quarrelled and opposed by them who use them not
we therefore out of our princely inclination to vniformity and peace
in matters especially that concern the holy worship of god
proposing to our self herein the pious examples of king edward the sixth
and of queen elizabeth
who sent forth injunctions
and orders about the divine service
and other ecclesiasticall matters
and of our dear father of blessed memory
king james
who published a book of constitutions and canons ecclesiasticall
and according to the act of parliament in this behalf having fully advised herein with our metropolitan
and with our commissioners authorised under our great seal for causes ecclesiasticall
have thought good to give them free leave to treat in convocation
and agree upon certain other canons necessary for the advancement of gods glory
the edifying of his holy church
and the due reverence of his blessed mysteries and sacraments
that as we ever have been
and by gods assistance by whom alone we reign shall ever so continue carefull and ready to cut off superstition with one hand
so we may no lesse expell irreverence and profanenesse with the other
whereby it may please almighty god
so to blesse vs
and this church committed to our government
that it may at once return unto the true former splendour of vniformity
devotion
and holy order
the luster whereof for some yeers by past hath been overmuch obscured
through the devices of some ill affected to that sacred order
wherein it had long stood from the very beginning of the reformation
and through inadvertencie of some in authority in the church under vs
we therefore by vertue of our prerogative royall
and supream authority in causes ecclesiasticall
by our severall and respective letters patents under our great seal of england
dated the fifteenth day of aprill now last past
and the twelfth day of may then next following
for the province of canterbury
and by our like letters patents dated the seven and twentieth day of the same moneth of aprill
and the twentieth day of the moneth of may aforesaid

to the end and purpose of vs limited and prescribed unto them
and have thereupon offered and presented the same unto vs
most humbly desiring vs to give our royall assent unto the same
according to the form of a certain statute or act of parliament made in that behalf in the 25th
yeer of the reign of king henry the eighth
and by our said prerogative royall and supream authority in causes ecclesiasticall
to ratifie by our letters patents under our great seal of england
and to confirm the same
the title and tenour of them being word for word as ensueth
constitutions and canons ecclesiasticall
treated upon by the archbishops of canterbury and york
presidents of the convocations for the respective provinces of canterbury and york
and the rest of the bishops and clergie of those provinces
and agreed upon with the kings majesties licence in their severall synods begun at london and york 1640

and sixteenth
i
concerning the regall power
whereas sundry lawes
ordinances
and constitutions have been formerly made for the acknowledgment and profession of the most lawfull and independent authority of our dread soveraign lord
the kings most excellent majestie
over the state ecclesiasticall and civil
we as our dutie in the first place bindes us
and so far as to us appertaineth enjoyn them all to be carefully observed by all persons whom they concern
upon the penalties in the said laws and constitutions expressed
and for the fuller and clearer instruction and information of all christian people within this realm in their duties in this particular
we do further ordain and decree
that every parson
vicar
curate
or preacher upon some one sunday in every quarter of the yeer at morning prayer
shall in the place where he serves
treatably
and audibly read these explanations of the regall power here inserted
the most high and sacred order of kings is of divine right
being the ordinance of god himself
founded in the prime laws of nature
and clearly established by expresse texts both of the old and new testaments
a supream power is given to this most excellent order by god himself in the scriptures
which is
that kings should rule and command in their severall dominions all persons of what rank or estate soever
whether ecclesiasticall or civill
and that they should restrain and punish with the temporall sword all stubborn and wicked doers
the care of gods church is so committed to kings in the scripture that they are commended when the church keeps the right way
and taxed when it runs amisse
and therefore her government belongs in chief unto kings
for otherwise one man would be commended for anothers care
and taxed but for anothers negligence
which is not gods way
the power to call and dissolve councels both nationall and provincial is the true right of all christian kings within their own realms or territories
and when in the first times of christs church
prelates used this power
it was therefore onely because in those dayes they had no christian kings
and it was then so onely used as in times of persecution
that is
with supposition in case it were required of submitting their very lives unto the very laws and commands even of those pagan princes
that they might not so much as seem to disturb their civill government
which christ came to confirm
but by no means to undermine
for any person or persons to set up
maintain
or avow in any their said realms or territories respectively
under any pretence whatsoever
any independent coactive power
either papall or popular whether directly or indirectly is to undermine their great royall office
and cunningly to overthrow that most sacred ordinance
which god himself hath established
and so is treasonable against god
as well as against the king
for subjects to bear arms against their kings
offensive or defensive
upon any pretence whatsoever
is the least to resist the powers
which are ordained of god
and though they do not invade
but onely resist
st
paul tels them plainly
they shall receive to themselves damnation
and although tribute
and custome
and aide
and subsidie
and all manner of necessary support and supply
be respectively due to kings from their subjects by the law of god
nature
and nations
for the publike defence
care and protection of them
yet neverthelesse
subjects have not onely possession of
but a true and just right
title and propertie
to
and in all their goods and estates
and ought so to have
and these two are so far from crossing one another
that they mutually go together
for the honourable and comfortable support of both
for as it is the dutie of the subjects to supply their king
so is it part of the kingly office to support his subjects in the property and freedom of their estates
and if any parson
vicar
curate
or preacher shall voluntarily or carelesly neglect his duty in publishing the said explications and conclusions
according to the order above prescribed
he shall be suspended by his ordinary
till such time as upon his penitence he shall give sufficient assurance
or evidence of his amendment
and in case he be of any exempt jurisdiction
he shall be censurable by his majesties commissioners for causes ecclesiasticall
and we do also hereby require all archbishops
bishops
and all other inferiour priests and ministers
that they preach
teach
and exhort their people to obey
honour
and serve their king
and that they presume not to speak of his majesties power in any other way then in this canon is expressed
and if any parson
vicar
curate
preacher
or any other ecclesiasticall person whatsoever
any deane
canon
or prebendarie of any collegiate or cathedrall church
any member or student of colledge or hall
or any reader of divinity
or humanity in either of the universities
or elswhere
shall in any sermon
lecture
common place
determination
or disputation either by word or writing
publikely maintain or abett any position or conclusion
in opposition or impeachment of the aforesaid explications
or any part or article of them
he shall forthwith by the power of his majesties commissioners for causes ecclesiasticall
be excommunicated till he repent
and suspended two yeers from all the profits of his benefice
or other ecclesiasticall
academicall
or scholasticall preferments
and if he so offend a second time
he shal be deprived from all his spirituall promotions
of what nature or degree soever they be
provided alwayes
that if the offence aforesaid be given in either of the universities
by men not having any benefice or ecclesiasticall preferment
that then the delinquent shall be censured by the ordinary authority in such cases of that university respectively
where the said fault shall be committed
ii
for the better keeping of the day of his majesties most happy inauguration
the synode taking into consideration the most inestimable benefits which this church enjoyeth
under the peaceable and blessed government of our dread sovereign lord
king charles
and finding that aswell the godly christian emperours in the former times
as our own most religious princes since the reformation
have caused the dayes of their inaugurations to be publikely celebrated by all their subjects
with prayers and thanksgiving to almighty god
and that there is a particular form of prayer appointed by authority for that day and purpose
and yet with all considering how negligent some people are in the observance of this day
in many places of this kingdom doth therefore decree and ordain
that all manner of persons within the church of england
shall from henceforth celebrate
and keep the morning of the said day
in coming diligently and reverently unto their parish church or chappell at the time of prayer
and there continuing all the while
that the prayers
preaching
or other service of the day endureth
in testimony of their humble gratitude to god for so great a blessing
and dutifull affections to so benigne and mercifull a sovereign
and for the better execution of this our ordinance
the holy synode doth straitly require and charge
and by authority hereof enableth all archbishops
bishops
deanes
deanes and chapters
arch-deacons
and other ecclesiasticall persons
having exempt or peculiar jurisdiction
as also all
chancellors
commissaries
and officialls in the church of england
that they enquire into the keeping of the same in their visitations
and punish such as they shall finde to be delinquent
according as by law they are to censure
and punish those who wilfully absent themselves from church on holy-dayes
and that the said day may be the better observed
we do enjoyn
that all church-wardens shall provide at the parish charge
two of those books at least
appointed for that day
and if there be any want of the said book in any parish
they shall present the same at all visitations respectively
iii
for suppressing of the growth of popery
all and every ecclesiasticall persons
of what rank or condition soever
arch-bishops
and bishops
deanes
arch deacons
all having exempt or peculiar jurisdiction
with their severall chancellours
commissaries
and officials
all persons intrusted with cure of soules
shall use respectively all possible care and diligence by conferring privately with the parties
and by censures of the church in inferiour and higher courts
as also by complaints unto the secular power
to reduce all such to the church of england
who are misled into popish superstition
and first these private conferences shall be performed in each severall diocesse
either by the bishop in person
if his occasion will permit it
or by some one or more learned ministers at his speciall appointment
and the said bishop shall also designe the time and place of the said severall conferences
and all such persons as shall be present which if recusants refuse to observe
they shall be taken for obstinate
and so certified to the bishop
and if the said time and place be not observed by the minister or ministers so appointed
they shall be suspended by their ordinary for the space of six moneths
without a very reasonable cause alleadged to the contrary
provided that they be not sent above ten miles from their dwelling
if the said conferences prevail not
the church must and shall come to her censures
and to make way for them
the said ecclesi ● sticall persons shall carefully inform themselves in the places belonging to their severall charges
of all recusants above the age of twelve yeers
both of such as come not at all to church
as also of those who coming sometimes thither
do yet refuse to receive the holy eucharist with us
as likewise of all those
who shall either say
or hear masse
and they shall in a more especiall manner enquire oft all those
who are either dangerously active to seduce any persons from the communion of the church of england
or seditiously busie to disswade his majesties subjects from taking the oath of allegiance
together with all them who abused by their sophistry
refuse to take the said oath
and we straightly command all parsons
vicars
and curates
that they carefully
and severally present at all visitations
the names and surnames of the delinquents of these severall kindes in their own parishes
under pain of suspension for six moneths
and likewise we straightly enjoyn all church-wardens and the like sworn officrs whatsoever
that by vertue of their oathes
they shall present at the said visitations the names of such persons
whom they know or hear of
or justly suspect to be delinquent
in all or any of these particulars
and that under the pains of the highest censures of the church
that so these delinquents may be legally cited
and being sound obstinate
they shall be excommunicated
and such excommunication shall be pronounced both in the cathedrall church of the diocesse
and in the severall parishes where such recusants live
and every third moneth they shall be again publikely repeated in the places aforesaid
that all may take notice of those sentences
and because there are places which either have
or pretend to haue exemptions
in which such delinquents do usually affect to make their aboad
therefore we enjoyn
that all bishops shall within their severall diocesses
send unto such places one or more of their chaplains
or some of their officers whom they may relie on
to make strict inquiry after o ● f ● nders in those kindes
who diligently returning their information accordingly
the said bishop shall certifie such informations to his metropolitan
that the aforesaid proceedings may forthwith issue from some higher courts in these cases
whereof by reason of the said exemptions the inferiour courts can take no cognisance but if neither conferring nor censures will prevail with such persons
the church hath no way left but complaints to the secular power
and for them we enjoyn
that all deanes and arch-deacons
and all having inferiour or exempt jurisdiction
shall every yeare within sixe moneths after any visitation by them holden
make certificate unto their severall bishops
or archbishop
if it be within his diocesse under their seale of office
of all such persons who have been presented unto them as aforesaid
under pain of suspension from their said jurisdictions by the space of one whole yeare
and we in like manner enjoyne all archbishops and bishops
that once every yeare at the least
they certifie under their episcopall seale in parchment
unto the justices of assise of every county in the circuits and within their diocesses respectively
the names and sirnames not onely of those who have been presented unto them from the said deanes
archdeacons
&amp; c
but of those also who upon the oathes of church-wardens and other sworne men at their visitations
or upon the information of ministers imployed in the said conferences
have been presented unto them
that so the said intended proceedings may have the more speedy and the more generall successe
in particular
it shall be carefully inquired into at all visitations under the oathes of the church-wardens and other sworne men
what recusants or popish persons have been either married or buryed
or have had their children baptized otherwise then according unto the rules and formes established in the church of england
and the names of such delinquents if they can learne them
or otherwise such names as for the time they carry shall be as aforesaid given up to the bishop
who shall present them to the justices of assise
to bee punished according to the statutes
and for the education of recusants children
since by canon already established
no man can teach schoole
no not in any private house except hee bee allowed by the ordinary of the place
and withall have subscribed to the articles of religion established in the church of england
we therefore straightly enjoyne
that forthwith at all visitations there bee diligent enquiry made by the churchwardens or other sworne ecclesiasticall officers of each parish
under their oathes
who are imployed
as schoole-masters to the children of recusants
and that their severall names be presented to the bishop of the diocesse
who citing the said schoole-masters shall make diligent search whether they have subscribed or no
and if they or any of them bee found to refuse subscription
they shall bee forbidden to teach hereafter
and censured for their former presumption
and withall the names of him or them that entertaine such a schoole-master
shall be certified to the bishop of the diocesse
who shall at the next assise present them to the judges to bee proceeded against according to the statutes
and if they subscribe
enquiry shall be made what care they take for the instruction of the said children in the catechisme established in the book of common prayer
and all ordinaries shall censure those whom they finde negligent in the said instruction
and if it shall appeare
that the parents of the said children doe forbid such schoole-masters to bring them up in the doctrine of the church of england
they shall notwithstanding doe their duty
and if thereupon the said parents shall take away their children
the said schoole-masters shall forthwith give up their names unto the bishop of the diocesse
who shall take care to returne them to the justices of assise in manner and forme aforesaid
and because some may cunningly elude this decree
by sending their children to bee bred beyond the seas
therefore wee ordaine that the church-wardens and other sworne ecclesiasticall officers shall likewise make carefull enquiry
and give in upon their oathes at all visitations
the names of such recusants children
who are so sent beyond the seas to be bred there
or whom they probably suspect to bee so sent
which names as aforesaid shall be given up to the bishop
and from him returned to the judges as aforesaid
that their parents
who so send them
may be punished according to law
provided alwayes that this canon shall not take away or derogate from any power or authority already given or established by any other canon now in force
and all the said complaints or certificates shall be presented up to the judges in their severall circuits by the bishops register
or some other of his deputies immediately after the publishing of his majesties commission
or at the end of the charge
which shall bee then given by the judge
and this upon paine of suspension for three moneths
this sacred synode doth earnestly intreat the said reverend justices of assise
to bee carefull in the execution of the said lawes committed to their trust
as they will answer to god for the daily encrease of this grosse kinde of superstition
and further
we doe also exhort all judges
whether ecclesiastical or temporall upon the like accompt
that they would not admit in any of their courts any vexatious complaint
suit or suits
or presentments against any minister
churchwardens
questmen
sidemen
or other church-officers for the making of any such presentments
and lastly
we enjoyne that every bishop shall once in every yeare send into his majesties high court of chancery
the names and sirnames of all such recusants who have stood excommunicated beyond the time limited by the law
and shall desire that the writ might bee at once sent out against them all ex officio
and for the better execution of this decree
this present synode doth most humbly beseech his most sacred majesty
that the officers of the said high court of chancery
whom it shall concerne
may bee commanded to send out the aforesaid writ from time to time as is desired
for that it would much exhaust the particular estates of the ordinaries
to sue out severall writs at their owne charge
and that the like command also may be laid upon the sheriffes and their deputies
for the due and faithfull execution of the said writs
as often as they shall be brought unto them
and to the end that this canon may take the better and speedier effect
and not to be deluded or delayed
we further decree and ordaine
that no popish recusant
who shall persist in the said sentence of excommunication
beyond the time prescribed by law
shall be absolved by vertue of any appeale in any ecclesiasticall court
unlesse the said partie shall first in his or her owne person
and not by a proctor
take the usuall oath
iv
against socinianisme
whereas much mischiefe is already done in the church of god by the spreading of the damnable and cursed heresie of socinianisme
as being a complication of many ancient heresies condemned by the foure first generall councels
and contrariant to the articles of religion now established in the church of england
and whereas it is too apparent that the said wicked and blasphemous errours are unhappily dilated by the frequent divulgation and dispersion of dangerous books written in favour and furtherance of the same
whereby many
especially of the younger or unsetled sort of people
may be poysoned and infected
it is therefore decreed by this present synode
that no stationer
printer
or importer of the said books
or any other person whatsoever
shall print
buy
sell
or disperse any booke
broaching or maintaining of the said abominable doctrine or positions
upon paine of excommunication ipso facto to be thereupon incurred
and wee require all ordinaries upon paine of the censures of the church
that beside the excommunication aforesaid
they doe certifie their names and offences under their episcopall seale to the metropolitan
by him to be delivered to his majesties attorney generall for the time being
to be proceeded withall according to the late decree
in the honourable court of star-chamber
against spreaders of prohibited books
and that no preacher shall presume to vent any such doctrine in any sermon under paine of excommunication for the first offence
and deprivation for the second
and that no student in either of the universities of this land
nor any person in holy orders
excepting graduates in divinity
or such as have episcopall or archidiaconall jurisdiction
or doctors of law in holy orders shall be suffered to have or reade any such socinian booke or discourse
under paine if the offender live in the university that he shal be punished according to the strictest statutes provided there against the publishing
reading
or maintaining of false doctrine
or if he live in the city or country abroad
of a suspension for the first offence
and excommunication for the second
and deprivation for the third
unlesse he will absolutely and in terminis abjure the same
and if any lay-man shall be seduced into this opinion
and be convicted of it
he shall be excommunicated
and not absolved but upon due repentance and abjuration
and that before the metropolitane
or his owne bishop at the least
and wee likewise enjoyne
that such bookes
if they be found in any prohibited hand
shall be immediately burned
and that there be a diligent search made by the appointment of the ordinary after all such books
in what hands soever
except they be now in the hands of any graduate in divinity
and such as have episcopall or archidiaconall jurisdiction
or any doctor of lawes in holy orders as aforesaid
and that all who now have them
except before excepted
be strictly commanded to bring in the said books
in the universities to the vice-chancellors
and out of the universities to the bishops
who shall returne them to such whom they dare trust with the reading of the said books
and shall cause the rest to be burned
and we farther enjoyne
that diligent enquiry be made after all such that shall maintaine and defend the aforesaid socinianisme
and when any such shall be detected
that they be complained of to the severall bishops respectively
who are required by this synode to represse them from any such propagation of the aforesaid wicked and detestable opinions
v
against sectaries
whereas there is a provision now made by a canon for the suppressing of poperie and the growth thereof by subjecting all popish recusants to the greatest severitie of ecclesiasticall censures in that behalfe
this present synode well knowing that there are other sects which indeavour the subversion both of the doctrine and discipline of the church of england no lesse then papists doe
although by another way
for the preventing thereof doth hereby decree and ordain
that all those proceedings and penalties which are mentioned in the aforesaid canon against popish recusants as far as they shall be appliable
shall stand in full force and vigour against all anabaptists
brownists
separatists
familists
or other sect or sects
person or persons whatsoever
who do or shall
either obstinately refuse
or ordinarily
not having a lawfull impediment that is
for the space of a moneth neglect to repair to their parish churches or chappels where they inhabit
for the hearing of divine service established
and receiving of the holy communion
according to law
and we do also further decree and ordain
that the clause contained in the canon now made by this synod against the books of socinianisme
shall also extend to the makers
importers
printers
and publishers
or dispersers of any book
writing
or scandalous pamphlet devised against the discipline and government of the church of england
and unto the maintainers and abettors of any opinion or doctrine against the same
and further
because there are sprung up among us a sort of factious people
despisers and depravers of the book of common prayer
who do not according to the law resort to their parish church or chappel
to joyn in the publique prayers
service
and worship of god with the congregation
contenting themselves with the hearing of sermons onely
thinking thereby to avoid the penalties due to such as wholly absent themselves from the church
we therefore for the restraint of all such wilfull contemners or neglecters of the service of god
do ordain that the church or chappell wardens
and questmen
or sidemen of every parish
shall be carefull to enquire out all such disaffected persons
and shall present the names of all such delinquents at all visitations of bishops
and other ordinaries
and that the same proceedings and penalties mentioned in the canon aforesaid respectively
shall be used against them as against other recusants
unlesse within one whole moneth after they are first denounced
they shall make acknowledgement and reformation of that their fault
provided alwayes
that this canon shall not derogate from any other canon
law
or statute in that behalf provided against those sectaries
vi
an oath injoyn &apos;d for the preventing of all innovations in doctrine and government
this present synod being desirous to declare their sincerity and constancie in the profession of the doctrine and discipline already established in the church of england
and to secure all men against any suspition of revolt to poperie
or any other superstition decrees that all arch-bishops
and bishops
and all other priests and deacons in places exempt or not exempt
shall before the second day of november next ensuing take this oath following against all innovation of doctrine or discipline
and this oath shall be tendred them
and every of them
and all others named after in this canon
by the bishop in person
or his chancelour
or some grave divines named and appointed by the bishop under his seal
and the said oath shall be taken in the presence of a publique notarie
who is hereby required to make an act of it
leaving the universities to the provision which followes
the oath is
i a
b
do swear
that i do approve the doctrine and discipline or government established in the church of england
as containing all things necessary to salvation
and that i will not endeavour by my self or any other
directly or indirectly
to bring in any popish doctrine
contrary to that which is so established
nor will i ever give my consent to alter the government of this church
by arch-bishops
bishops
deanes
and arch-deacons
&amp; c
as it stands now established
and as by right it ought to stand
nor yet ever to subject it to the usurpations and superstitions of the sea of rome
and all these things i do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear
according to the plain and common sence and understanding of the same words
without any equivocation
or mentall evasion
or secret reservation whatsoever
and this i do heartily
willingly
and truely
upon the faith of a christian
so help me god
in jesus christ
and if any man beneficed or dignified in the church of england
or any other ecclesiasticall person shall refuse to take this oath
the bishop shall give him a moneths time to inform himself
and at the moneths end
if he refuse to take it
he shall be suspended ab officio
and have a second moneth granted
and if then he refuse to take it
he shall be suspended
and have a third moneth granted him for his better information
but if at the end of that moneth he refuse to take the oath above-named
he shall by the bishop be deprived of all his ecclesiasticall promotions whatsoever
and execution of his function which he holds in the church of england
and we likewise constitute and ordain
that all masters of arts the sons of noble-men onely excepted all bachelours and doctors in divinity
law
or physick
all that are licenced to practise physick
all registers
actuaries
and proctors
all school-masters
all such as being natives or naturalized
do come to be incorporated into the universities here
having taken a degree in any forraign university
shall be bound to take the said oath
and we command all governours of colledges and halls in either of the universities
that they administer this said oath to all persons resident in their severall houses that have taken the degrees before mentioned in this canon
within six moneths after the publication hereof
and we likewise constitute
that all bishops shall be bound to give the said oath unto all those to whom they give holy orders
at the time of their ordination
or to whomsoever they give collation
institution
or licence to preach
or serve any cure
vii
a declaration concerning some rites and ceremonies
because it is generally to be wished
that unity of faith were accompanied with uniformity of practise
in the outward worship and service of god
chiefly for the avoiding of groundlesse suspitions of those who are weak
and the malicious aspersions of the professed enemies of our religion
the one fearing innovations
the other flattering themselves with a vain hope of our backslidings unto their popish superstition
by reason of the situation of the communion table
and the approaches thereunto
the synod declareth
as followeth that the standing of the communion table
side-way under the east window of every chancell
or chappell
is in its own nature indifferent
neither commanded nor condemned by the word of god
either expresly
or by immediate deduction
and therefore that no religion is to be placed therein
or scruple to be made thereon
and albeit at the time of reforming this church from that grosse superstition of popery
it was carefully provided that all meanes should be used to root out of the mindes of the people
both the inclination thereunto
and memory therof
especially of the idolatry committed in the masse
for which cause all popish altars were demolished
yet notwithstanding it was then ordered by the injunctions and advertisements of queen elizabeth
of blessed memory
that the holy tables should stand in the place where the altars stood
and accordingly have been continued in the royall chappells of three famous and pious princes
and in most cathedrall
and some parochiall churches
which doth sufficiently acquit the manner of placing the said tables from any illegality
or just suspition of popish superstition or innovation
and therefore we judge it fit and convenient
that all churches and chappels do conform themselves in this particular
to the example of the cathedral
or mother churches
saving alwaies the generall liberty left to the bishop by law
during the time of administration of the holy communion
and we declare that this situation of the holy table
doth not imply that it is
or ought to be esteemed a true and proper altar
whereon christ is again really sacrificed
but it is
and may be called an altar by us
in that sense in which the primitive church called it an altar
and in no other
and because experience hath shewed us
how irreverent the behaviour of many people is in many places
some leaning
others casting their hats
and some sitting upon
some standing
and others sitting under the communion table in time of divine service
for the avoiding of these and the like
it is thought meet and convenient by this present synod
that the said communion tables in all chancells or chappells
be decently severed with rails to preserve them from such or worse profanations
and because the administration of holy things is to be performed with all possible decency and reverence
therefore we judge it fit and convenient
according to the word of the service-book established by act of parliament
draw neer
&amp; c
that all communicants with all humble reverence shall draw neer and approach to the holy table
there to receive the divine mysteries
which have heretofore in some places been unfitly carried up and down by the minister
unlesse it shall be otherwise appointed in respect of the incapacity of the place
or other inconvenience by the bishop himself in his jurisdiction
and other ordinaries respectively in theirs
and lastly
whereas the church is the house of god
dedicated to his holy worship
and therefore ought to minde us
both of the greatnesse and goodnesse of his divine majestie
certain it is that the acknowledgement thereof
not onely inwardly in our hearts
but also outwardly with our bodies
must needs be pious in it self
profitable unto us
and edifying unto others
we therefore think it very meet and behoovefull
and heartily commend it to all good and well affected people
members of this church
that they be ready to tender unto the lord the said acknowledgement
by doing reverence and obeisance
both at their coming in
and going out of the said churches
chancels
or chappels
according to the most ancient custome of the primitive church in the purest times
and of this church also for many yeers of the reign of queen elizabeth
the reviving therefore of this ancient and laudable custome
we heartily commend to the serious consideration of all good people
not with any intention to exhibite any religious worship to the communion table
the east
or church
or any thing therein contained in so doing
or to perform the said gesture
in the celebration of the holy eucharist
upon any opinion of a corporall presence of the body of jesus christ
on the holy table
or in the mysticall elements
but onely for the advancement of gods majestie
and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him
and no otherwise
and in the practise or omission of this rite
we desire that the rule of charity prescribed by the apostle
may be observed
which is
that they which use this rite despise not them who use it not
and that they who use it not
condemn not those that use it
viii
of preaching for conformity
whereas the preaching of order and decencie
according to st pauls rule
doth conduce to edification
it is required
that all preachers as well beneficed men as others shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the people in their publike sermons twice in the yeer at the least
that the rites and ceremonies now established in the church of england are lawfull and commendable
and that they the said people and others
ought to conform themselves in their practise to all the said rites and ceremonies
and that the people and others ought willingly to submit themselves unto the authority and government of the church as it is now established under the kings majestie
and if any preacher shall refuse or neglect to do according to this canon
let him be suspended by his ordinary
during the time of his refusall
or wilfull forbearance to do thereafter
ix
one book of articles of inquiry to be used at all parochiall visitations
for the better settling of an uniformity in the outward government and administration of the church
and for the more preventing of just grievances which may be laid upon church-wardens and other sworn-men
by any impertinent
inconvenient
or illegall enquiries in the articles for ecclesiasticall visitations
this synode hath now caused a summary or collection of articles out of the rubricks of the service-book
and the canons and warrantable rules of the church to be made
and for future direction to be deposited in the records of the arch-bishop of canterbury
and we do decree and ordain
that from henceforth no bishop or other person whatsoever having right to hold
use
or exercise any parochiall visitation
shall under the pain of a moneths suspension upon a bishop
and two moneths upon any other ordinary that is delinquent
and this to be incurred ipso facto cause to be printed or published
or otherwise to be given in charge to the church-warden
or to any other persons which shall be sworn to make
any other articles or formes of enquiry upon oath
then such onely as shal be approved and allowed unto him upon due request made by his metropolitan under his seal of office
provided alwaies that after the end of three yeers next following the date of these presents
the metropolitan shal not either at the instance of those which have right to hold parochiall visitations
or upon any other occasion
make any addition or diminution from that allowance to any bishop
of visitatory articles
which he did last before in any diocesse
within his province approve of
but calling for the same shall hold and give that onely for a perpetual rule
and then every parish shal be bound onely to take the said book from the arch-deacons and other having a peculiar or exempt jurisdiction
but once from that time
in three yeers
in case they do make it appear that they have the said book remaining in their publike for the use of the parish
and from every bishop they shall receive the said articles at the episcopall visitation onely
and in manner and form as formerly they have been accustomed to do
and at no greater price then what hath bin usually paied in the said diocesse respectively
x
concerning the conversation of the clergie
the sober
grave and exemplary conversation of al those that are imployed in administration of holy things
being of great avail for the furtherance of pietie it hath been the religious care of the church of england
strictly to enjoyn to all &amp; every one of her clergie
a pious
regular
and inoffensive demeanour and to prohibit all loose and scandalous carriage by severe censures to be inflicted upon such delinquents
as appeares by the 74
and 75
canons anno 1603
provided to this purpose
for the more affectuall successe of which pious and necessary care
this present synode
straitly charges all cleargie men in this church
that setting before their eyes the glory of god
the holinesse of their calling
and the edification of the people committed to them
they carefully avoid all excesse and disorder
and that by their christian and religious conversation they shine forth as lights unto others in all godlinesse and honesty
and we also require all those to whom the government of the clergie of this church is committed
that they set themselves to countenance and encourage godlinesse
gravitie
sobrietie
and all unblameable conversation in the ministers of this church
and that according to the power with which they are intrusted
they diligently labour by the due execution of the above named canons
and all other ecclesiasticall provisions made for this end
to reform all offensive and scandalous persons
if any be in the ministerie
as they tender the welfare and prospering of pietie and religion
and as they will answer to god for those scandals
which through their remisnesse and neglect shall arise and grow in this church of christ
xi
chancellours patents
for the better remedying and redresse of such abuses as are complained of in the ecclesiasticall courts
the synode doth decree and ordain
that hereafter no bishop shall graunt any patent to any chancellour
commissarie
or officiall
for any longer terme
then the life of the grauntee onely
nor otherwise then with expresse reservation to himself
and his successours
of the power to execute the said place
either alone
or with the chancellour
if the bishop shall please to do the same
saving alwayes to the said chancellors
&amp; c
the fees accustomably taken for executing the said jurisdiction
and that in all such patents
the bishop shall keep in his own hands the power of institution unto benefices
as also of giving licenses to preach or keep school
and further
that no deane and chapter confirme any patent of any chancellour
commissaries
or officials place
wherein the said conditions are not expressed
to the deane or his locum tenens if he passe the act in his absence and to every canon
or prebendary
voting to the confirmation of the said act
to be inflicted by the arch-bishop of the province
and further
the holy synode doth decree and ordain that no reward shall be taken for any chancellours
commissaries or officials place under the heaviest censures of the church
xii
chancellours alone not to censure any of the clergie in sundry cases
that no chancellour
commissarie
or officiall
unlesse he be in holy orders
shall proceed to suspension
or any higher censure against any of the clergie in any criminall cause
other then neglect of appearance
upon legall citing
but that all such causes shall be heard by the bishop in person
or with the assistance of his chancellour
or commissarie
or if the bishops occasions will not permit
then by his chancellour
or commissarie
and two grave dignified
or benficed ministers of the diocesse to be assigned by the bishop
under his episcopall seal
who shall hear and censure the said cause in the consistorie
xiii
excommunication and absolution not to be pronounced but by a priest
that no excommunications or absolutions shall be good or valid in law
except they be pronounced
either by the bishop in person
or by some other in holy orders
having ecclesiasticall jurisdiction
or by some grave minister beneficed in the diocesse
being a master of arts
at least
and appointed by the bishop
and the priests name pronouncing such sentence of excommunication
or absolution to be expressed in the instrument issuing under seal out of the court
and that no such minister shall pronounce any sentence of absolution but in open consistory
or at the least in a church or chappell
the penitent humbly craving and taking absolution upon his knees
and having first taken the oath
and that no parson
vicar
or curate
shall declare any of his or their parishioners to be excommunicate
or shall admit any of them so excommunicate into the church
and there declare them to be absolved
except they first receive such excommunications and absolutions under the seal of the ecclesiasticall judge
from whom it cometh
xiiii
concerning commutations
and the disposing of them
that no chancellor
commissary
or officiall
shall have power to commute any penance in whole
or in part
but either together with the bishop in person
or with his privity in writing
or if by himself
there he shall give up a full and just account of all such commutations once every yeer
at michaelmas to the bishop
who shall with his chancellor
see that all such moneyes be disposed of to charitable and publike uses
according to law
and if any chancellor or other
having jurisdiction
as aforesaid
shall not make such a just account to the bishop
and be found guilty of it
he shall be suspended from all exercise of his jurisdiction
for the space of one whole yeer
alwayes provided
that if the crime be publikely complained of
and do appear notorious
that then the office shall signifie to the place
from whence the complaint came
that the delinquent hath satisfied the church for his offence
and the minister shall signifie it as he shall be directed
saving alwayes to all chancellers
and other ecclesiasticall officers their due and accustomable fees
if he or they be not so suspended as aforesaid
xv
touching concurrent iurisdictions
that in such places wherein there is concurrent jurisdiction
no executor be cited into any court or office
for the space of ten dayes after the death of the testator
and that aswell every apparitor herein
as every register
or clark that giveth or carrieth out any citation or processe to such intent
before that the said ten dayes be expired
shall for the first offence herein
be suspended from the execution of his office
for the space of three moneths
and for the second offence
in this kinde
be and stand excommunicated
ipso facto
not to be restored
but by the metropolitan of the province
or his lawfull surrogate
and that yet neverthelesse
it be lawfull for any executor
to prove such wills when they thinke good
within the said ten dayes
before any ecclesiasticall judge respectively
to whose jurisdiction the same may
or doth appertaine
xvi
concerning licences to marrie
whereas divers licences to marry
are granted by ordinaries
in whose jurisdiction
neither of the parties
desiring such licence
is resident
to the prejudice of the archiepiscopall prerogative
to whom only the power of granting such licences
to parties of any jurisdiction
by law belongeth
and for other great inconveniences thereupon ensuing
it is therefore decreed
that no licence of marriage shall be granted by any ordinary to any parties
unlesse one of the said parties have beene commorant in the jurisdiction of the said ordinary
for the space of one whole moneth
immediately before the said licence be desired
and if any ordinary shall offend herein
and be sufficiently evinced thereof
in any of the lord archbishops courts
he shall be liable to such censure as the lord archbishop shall thinke fit to inflict
and we further decree
that one of the conditions in the bond of securitie given by the parties taking such licence
shall be
that the said partie
or one of them
have
or hath beene a moneth commorant in the said jurisdiction
immediately before the said licence granted
and the synod decrees
that whatsoever is ordered in these six last canons
concerning the jurisdiction of bishops
their chancellors

shall so farre as by law is applyable be in force
concerning all deanes
deanes and chapters
collegiate churches
archdeacons
and all in holy orders
having exempt
or peculiar jurisdiction
and their severall officers respectively
xvii
against vexatious citations
and that this synod may prevent all grievances
which may fall upon the people by citations into ecclesiasticall courts
upon pretence only of the breach of law
without either
or any other just ground
this present synod decrees
that for all times to come no such citation
grounded only as aforesaid
shall issue out of any ecclesiasticall court
except the said citation be sent forth under the hand and seale of the chancellor
commissarie
archdeacon
or other competent judge of the said court
within thirty dayes after the fault committed
and returne thereof to be mode the next
or second court day after the citation served at the farthest
and that the partie so cited
unlesse he be convinced by two witnesses
shall
upon the denyall of the fact upon oath
be forthwith freely dismissed without any payment of fees
provided that this decree exceed not to any grievous crime
as schisme
incontinencie
misbehaviour in the church in time of divine service
obstinate inconformitie

to the redres of long accustome euylls and damnable sectes
to the supportacion and mayntenaunce of godly and alowable ceremonyes
to the suppressynge and most to be desired abolishyng of the deuelishe and detestable vsurped aucthoryties
dampnable errours and prophane abuses brought in by that myghty golyas
that obdurated phareo
that proude nembroth whome god amende the byshope of rome

and so to establishe the hartes of hys gracys true subiectes that they may wyllyngly and according to theyr dueties
obey and fulfyll hys most lawfull and godly ordened lawes and commaundementis wherby they shall not onely do the thyng agreable to goddes wylle and teachynges
in that he willeth euery soule to be subiected to the hygher power and obedyent to theyr prynce
but also to theyr greate laude and prayse shall shewe them selfe to be redy and confirmable to do theyr dueties in aydyng hys excellent hyghnes to the reformacyon of all pernicious abuses and chiefly of detestable ydolatrye
whiche is so muche prohibited in holy scripture and most displeasant to god
for whiche intent and purpose the sayd most noble and famous clarke dsiderius erasmus
compiled and made this dialoge in laten
as it foloweth her after nowe lately translated into our mother the englishhe tonge
auoyd therfore
most deare readere
all abuses wherby any inconuenyence may growe
other to the hynderaunce of godes worde
to the displeasure of thy prynce
whome thou arte so straytly commaunded to obaye
or to the domage of a publike weale
whiche aboue all vices is noted most to be abhorred
not alonely of the most holy wryteres and expownderes of scripture
but also of prophane gentylles
whiche neuer perceyuyd other thinge than nature enclyned theyr hartes vnto
and so consequently to obtayne the fruytion of the godhode thorowe the faythe that was spoken of at the begynnynge to the whiche the lorde iesus christe brynge vs all with a perfaycte quyetnes
so be it
a pylgremage for pure deuocyon
signifieth to forsake
what new thynge ys it
that i se
doo i nat see gyus my neybur
whom no man could espie of all thes sex monthes before
yt was a sayng that he was deed
it is euen he
except that i be ferre deceyuyd
i wyll go to hym
and byd hym good morow
good morow , was faynyd of an old kynge of thebanes
good morow to you
i pray you frome what contray do you come to vs ayen so saffe
for here was a great comunicacyon that you dyd sayle streght to hell
thankyd be god
i haue faryd as well syns i went hens
as euer i dyd in all my lyffe
well
a man may well perceyue that all suche rumours be but vanytye
but i pray you what araye is this that you be in
me thynke that you be clothyd with cokle schelles
and you be pretely garnyshyd with wrethes of strawe and your arme is full of
walsyngam ys callyd para thalass ● ● by cause it is ny to the see
snakes egges
i haue bene on pylgremage at saynt iames in compostella
and at my retourne i dyd more relygyously vysyte our lady of walsyngam in england
a very holy pylgremage
but i dyd rather vysyte her
for i was ther before within this thre yere
my mother in law dyd make a vowe that if her doughter shuld be delyueryd of a man chyld alyue
than that i shuld go to saynt iames on pylgremage
and ther to salute and thanke hym
dyd you salute saynt iames alonly in your name
and your mothers
no
in the name of all owre house
uerely i thynke that your howshold as well shold haue prosperd
in case you had not salutyd hym at all
but i pray you what answer dyd he make to your salutacyon
nothynge at all
but whan i dyd offre
me tought he dyd lawghe vpon me
and becke at me with his hedde
and dyd reche to me this cokleshell
wherfore dothe he gyue rather suche schelles
than other thynges
for the see
whiche is nye vnto hym dothe mynystre plenty of suche
o holy saynt iames
that bothe is a mydwyffe to women with chyld
and also dothe helpe his pylgrymes
but i pray you what new kynd of makyng vowes is that that whan a man is ydle he shall put the burden apon an other mannes bakke
in case that you doo bynd youre selffe with a vowe
that yf the matter chaunche happyly whiche you haue in hande
that i for you shall fast twyse in on weke
do you beleue that i can fulfyll youre vow
no
i doo not beleue it if that you dyd vowe it in youre awne name
it is but a sport with yow to mokke sayntes
but this was my mother in law
i must nedys obey her
you know womenes affectyones
and i must obaye heres
if that you had not perfourmyd your vowe
what had you be in
i graunt
he could not haue had an accyon ayenst me in the law
but he myght fromhensforthe be deafe to my vowes
orels pryuyly send some calamytye or wretchednes amongste my housholde
yow know well enuffe the maneres of great men
tell me now what that same honest man saynt iames dothe
and howe he farythe
moche colder than he was wontyd to do
what is the cause of it
his age
oh you scoffer
yow know wel enoghe that sayntes wax nat olde
but this new learnynge
whiche runnythe all the world ouer now a dayes
dothe cause hym to be vysytyd moche lesse than he was wontyd to be
for if any doo come thay salute him alonly
but they offre lytle or nothynge
and say that theyr monaye may bettre be disposyd amongste pore people
o a wykyd comunicacyon
ye and so great an apostle whiche was wontyd to stand all in precyous stones and gold
now standythe all of wodde hauynge before hym skaresly a wax candle
if it be trew that i here
it is great ioperdy lest that same chance to all the rest of the sayntes
i thynk it wel
for ther is an epistle abrode whiche our lady dyd wryte apon the same matter
what lady
our ladi of stone in raurachia whiche is a certayne cuntre
she that hathe her name of a stone
i trawe it is in raurachia
that same is it
yow tell me of a stony lady
but to whome dyd she wryte
the epistle dothe playnely shew his name
by whome was it sent
no dowbt but by an angell
whiche dyd lay the wrytynges apon the aultre
wherof he prechythe to whome it was sent
and lest there shuld be any suspectyon of crafty conuayence in you
you shall se the epistle wryten with his owne hande
do you know so well the hand of th angell whiche is secretary to our lady
yee why nat
by what argument
i haue redde that is a scripture wryten on a graue
epithaphe of bede which was grauyd of the angell
and the letteres agre in all thynges
i haue redden also the obligacyon whiche was sent to saynt gyles as dothe aper
dothe not thes argumentes proue that mater to be good enoghe
may a man loke apon them
ye and if you wyll swere to kepe it preuy
oh you shall speake to a stone
ther be stones now a dayes of that name very slanderous
that wyll hyde nothynge
you shall speake to a domme man
and yow trust nat a stone
apon that condycyon i wyll tell it
loke that you here with bothe youre eyares
so i doo
the epistle of our lady
mary the mother of iesu to glaucoplutus desirus of ryches
glaucoplutus sendythe gretynge
insomoche as you folowe luther
you nobly perswade
that it is but in vayne to call apon sayntes
do ye well know for that to be grettly in my fauore
for vntyll thys day i haue almost be slayne with the importunate prayers of men
of me alone they askyd al thynges
as who shuld say my sone were alway a babe
because he is so faynyd and payntyd apon my breste
that yet he wold be at my commaundement and durst nat denye my petycyon
dredynge that if he denye my petycyon
that i shuld denye hym myte ate whan he is a thurst
and veryoft thay requyre that of me
whiche a shamfast yongman dare scantly aske of a bawde
yee they be suche thynges as i am ashamyd to put in wrytynge
now comythe the marchauntman and he redy to sayle into spayne for a vantage
dothe commytte hys wyues honesty to me
than commythe thet lytle preaty nunne and she castythe away her vayle redy to runne away
she leuythe with me the good name of her vyrgynytye
whiche shortly she entendythe to take monay for
than cryeth the wykyd soudyer purposyd to robbe and saythe
blessyd lady send me a good praye
now commythe the vnthryfty dyasser and cryethe
send me good chance lady and thow shalt haue parte of my wynnynges
and if the dyasse runne ayenst hym
he blasphemes
and cursythe me
bycause i wyll nat fauor his noghtynes
now cryeth she that sellythe her selffe for fylthye lukre and saythe
swete lady send me some costomers
and if i denye it
they exclame ayenst me and say
thou arte not the mother of marcy
moreouer the vowes of some women be no lesse wykyd than folishe
the mayd cryeth and saythe
o swet mary send me a fayre and riche husbond
the maryed woman saythe send me goodly chylderen
now laborythe the woman with chyld
and cryeth dere lady dylyuer me of my bondes
than commythe the olde wyffe
and saythe flowre of all women send me to lyue longe withowt coghe and drynes
now crepythe the dotynge oldman and saythe
lady send me for to wax yonge ayen
than commythe forth the phylosopher and cryethe send me some argumentis that be insoluble
the great prest cryethe send me a fat benefyce
than saythe the bysshope kepe well my churche
than cryethe the hye iustyce shew me thy sone or i passe out of this worlde
than saythe the cowrtyer send me trwe confession at the howre of my deathe
the husbondman saythe send vs temperate wether
the mylke wyffe cryethe owt blessyd lady saue our catell
now if i denye anythynge by and by
if i commytte it to me sone
i here them say
he wyll what so euer you wyll
shall i than alone bothe a woman and a mayd helpe maryneres
sawd yeres
marchantmen
dyasseres
maryedme ̄
women with chyld
iudges
kynges
and husbondmen
ye and this that i haue sayd is the least parte of my payne
but i am nat now so moche trobled with soche busynes
for that i wold hartely thanke you
but that this commodytye dothe brynge a greater disco ̄ modytye with hym
i haue now more ease
but lesse honor and profett
before this tyme i was callyd quene of heuen
lady of the world
but now any man wyll skarsly say ave maria or hayle mary
before i was clothyd with precyous stones and gold
and had my chaunges
and dayly ther was offeryd gold and precyous stones
now i am skarsly coueryd with halffe a gowne and that is all beeyten with mysse
my yerly rentes be now so smalle that i am skarsly able to fynde my pore quere kepar to light a wax candle before me
yet all this myght be sufferyd
but you be abowt to pluke away greater thynges
you be abowt as they say that what so euer any saynte hathe in any place
to take hyt frome the churches
but take hede what you doo
for ther is no saynte without a way to reuenge his wronge
if you cast saynt petre forthe of the churche
he may serue you of the same sauce
and shite vp heuyngates ayenst you
ye saynt paule hathe his sworde
barthylmew is nat without his great knyffe
saynt wyllyam is harnysyd vnder his monkes cloke
nat withowt a greate speare
what canst thou doo ayenst saynt george whiche is bothe a knyght and all armyd with hys longe spere and his fearfull sword
nor saynt antony is nat withowt hys weapenes for he hathe holy fyre with hym
ye the rest of the sayntes haue theyr weapones or myschefues
whiche they send apon whome they liste
but as for me thou canst not cast owt
except thou cast owt my sone
whiche i hold in myne armes
i wyll nat be seperat frome hym
other thou shalt cast hym owt with me orels thou shalt let vs bothe be
except that you wold haue a temple withowt a christe
these be the thynges that i wold yow shall know ymagyne you therfore what shal be your answer
for this thinge pleasythe me very well
frome oure stony churche the calendes of auguste
the yere frome my sonnes passyon
i stony lady subscrybyd thys with myne owne hande
trewly that was a soro and fearfull epistle
i suppose that glaucoplutus wyll beware fro ̄ he ̄ sforthe
ye and if he be wyse
wherfore dyd nat that good saynt iames wryte to that man of the same mater
i can nat tell
except it be bycause he is so ferre of
and now a dayes men be moche searchyd for suche maters
and in theyr iornaye theyr lettres taken frome them
i pray you
what god dyd send you into englond
i saw the wynd maruelouse prosperouse thyderward
and i had almoste promysyd this to that blessyd lady of walsyngam that i wold seke her within two yere
what wold you axe of her
no new thyngꝭ at all
but suche as be comen
as to kepe saffe and sownd my housholde
to encreasse my goodes
and in thys world to haue alonge and mery liffe
and whan i dye euerlastynge lyffe in another worlde
may nat owr lady grante the same at home with vs
she hathe at antwarpe a moche more lordly temple than at walsynganie
i denye nat but it may be so
but in dyuers places she grantes dyuers thynges
wether it be her pleasur so to do
or bycause she is so gentle
that as concernynge this purpose
she wyll gyue her selfe to our affectyo ̄ es
i haue harde oft of saynt iames
but i pray you describe to me the kyngdome of walsyngam
uerely i shall tell you as shortly as i canne
yt is the most holy name in all england
and you may fynde some in that
that suppose thayr substance shal nat prospayre except they vysyte her with thayr offerynge euery yere ones as thay be able to gyue
wher dothe she dwell
at the vttermost parte of all england betwyxt the northe and the weste
nat vary ferre frome the see
skarsly iij myles
the towne is almost susteynyd by the resort of pylgrymes
the college is of cano ̄ es
but thay be suche as hathe thayr name of the laten tonge and be called seculares
a kynd betwyxte monkes and chanones
suche as the monstre fyber is abeste of the see and the land
fyber is
no thay be rather suche as the a cocatrice wil kyll a man with a loke
cocatrice
but withowt dissimulation
i shall put you owt of this dowte in thre wordes
to them that thay hate
thay be chanones
and to them that thay loue thay he monkes menede
yet yowe doo nat open thys redle
i shall paynte it before youre eyes
if the bysshope of rome doo shot hys thonderbowlt amongst all monkes
thay wyll than be chanones
and nat monkes
but and if he wold suffre all monkes to take wyues
than wyll they be monkes
o new partakeres
i wold to god they wold take away my wyffe
but to come to our purpose
the college hathe skarsly any other renttes
emolumentes but of the liberalite of our lady
for the great offeryngis be kepyd stylle
but if ther be any litle some of monaye offerid that goith to the comens of the company
and the mayster whome thay call pryoure
be thay of a vertuous lyffe
nat to be dispraysyd
thay be more vertuous than ryche of thayr yerely renttes
the temple ys goodly and goregious
but oure lady dwellythe nat in it
but that was purchasyd for the honor of her sone
she hathe her owne temple
that she may be of the ryght hand of her sone
apon the righthand
whiche way dothe her sonne loke than
it is well remembryd
whan he lokythe to te west
his mother is apon his right hand
but whan he turnythe hym to the este she is apon the lefte hand
but yet she dwellythe nat in that churche
for it is nat yet buyldyd all vpe
and the wynde runnythe thorow euery parte with open wyndowes and dowres
and also nat ferre of is the occiane seye father of all wyndes
what doo yow tell me wher dothe she dwell than
in the same churche whiche i told you was nat all fynyshyd
ther is a lytle chapell seelyd ouer with wodde
on ether syde a lytle dore wher the pylgrymes go thorow
ther is lytle light
but of the taperes
with a fragrant smell
all these be mete for religyon
ye menedemus if you loke within you wyll say that it is a seate mete for sayntes
all thynges be so bright with gold
syluer
and precyous stones
you almost moue me to go thyther also
it shal nat repente you of your iornay
spryngithe ther no holy oyle
i trowe you dote
that spryngythe nat but owt of the sepulchres of sayntes
as saynt andrew
and saynt kateren
owr lady was nat beried
i graunt i sayd amysse
but tell on your tale
so moche more as thay persayue youre deuocyon
so moche larger reliques wyl thay shew to you
ye and peraduenture that thay may haue larger offerynges
as is sayd that
many lytle offerynges makythe a heuy boxe
gy
her chaplenꝭ be alway at hand
be thay of the chanones
no
thay be nat permyttyd to be with her
lest that peraduenture by occasyon of that religyon
thay shuld be plukkyd frome thayr owne religyon
and whylst thay kepe that virgyne
thay regard very lytle thayr awne virgynyte
alonly in that inner chapell whiche is our ladyes preuy chambre
ther standithe a certayne chanon at the autre
for what purpose
to receyue and kepe
that whiche is offeryd
dothe any man gyue ayenst hys wyll
no
but many men hathe suche a gentle shamfastnes
that thay wyll gyue some thynge to hym that standythe by
other thay wyll offre more largely
whiche that wold nat doo perauenture if that he were absent
that standithe there
you tell me of mannes affectiones
whiche i my selffe prouyd very ofte
ye trewly there be some so gyuen to our blessyd lady
that whan thay apere to putvpe thayr handes to offre
with a propre conuayance
thay stayl that whiche other men hathe gyuen
than lett no man be there
wyll nat oure lady shote her thonderbowlte at suche
wherfor shuld our lady rather doo so
than god hymselffe
whom thay be nat affrayd to pluke owt hys robes
and breake the churche walles therfore
i am in a great doubt whether i shuld
rather maruayle apon th ayre wykyd boldnes
or goddys great gentlenes and longe sufferynge
apon the northe parte ther is a certayne gaate
but lest that you should make a lye
it is nat of the churche
but of the pale that compassithe a bowte the churche yarde
and that hathe a lytle wykyt
suche as be in great mennes gaates
that who so euer wyll entre
must fyrst putin hys legge
nat withowt some ioperdie
and than bowe downe hys hedde
it is ioperdie to goo thorow suche a dore
to a mannes enemye
so it is
the sexten dyd tell me that ther was ones a knyght whiche fleeynge hys enemye
than aprochynge
dyd ride thorow the wykyte
and than the wretche dispayrynge in hym selffe
apon a soden motion
dyd commend hymselffe to the blessyd virgyne
whiche was than at hand
but now commythe the myrakle
by and by that knyght was all in the churche yarde
and hys aduersary was ragynge at the dore withowte
and dyd he tell you so maruylous a myrakle for a trewthe
no dowte
but i suppose that he could nat so lyghtely doo that to you so a great a philosopher
he dyd shewe to me in that same wykytte in a plate of coper
the ymage of the knyght fastenyd with nayles and with the same garmentes that the englishmen were wontyd to wayre at that tyme
as you may see in that olde pictures
whiche wyl nat lye
barbourꝭ had but lytle lyuynge at that tyme
and dieres and websteres gotte but litle monay
why so
for he had a berd like a goote
and his cote had neuer a plyte
and it was so litle
that with strayte gyrdynge it mayd hys body to apere lesse than it was
ther was another plate
that was in quantyte and fourme like to a cheste
well now it is nat to be doubtyd apon
under the wykyte ther was a grate of yrne
that no man can passe theryn but a footeman
for it is nat conuenyent that any horsse shuld tread after apon the place
whiche the knyght dyd consecrate to owr lady
nat withowt a good cause
frome that parte toward the este
there is a litle chapell
full of maruayles and thyther i wente
ther was i receyuyd of another of our ladyes chaplenes
ther we knelyd downe
to make our litle prayeres
by and by
he broght for the the ioynte of a mannes fynger
the greatyste of thre
whiche i kyssyd
and askyd whose relyques thay were
he dyd say that thay were saynt petres
what th apostle sayd i
ye sayd he
than i dyd better beholde the ioynte
whiche for hys greatenes myght well haue be a gyantes ioynte
rather than a mannes
than sayd i
saynt peter must nedys be a great man of stature
but at that word
ther was one of the gentlemen that stode by
that could not forbere lawghynge
for the whiche i was very sory
for if he had holden hys pease
we had sene all the relyques
yet we metely well pleasyd mayster sexten
with gyuynge hym two or three grotes
before that chapell there was a litle howsse
whiche he sayd ones in wynter tyme whan that there was litle rowme to couer the reliques
that it was sodenly broght and sett in that place
under that house there was a couple of pittes
bothe fulle of water to the brynkys
and thay say that the sprynge of thos pittes is dedicate to our lady
that water is very colde
and medycynable for the hede ake and that hartburnynge
if that cold water wyll hele the paynes in the hede and stomake
than wyll oyle putowte fyre from hensforthe
it is a myrakle that i tell
good syr
orels what maruayle shuld it be
that cowld water shuld slake thurste
this may well be one parte of your tale
thay say that the fowntayne dyd sodenly sprynge owte of the erthe at the commaundement of our lady
and i dilygently examenynge al thynges
dyd aske hym how many yeres it was sythe that howsse was so sodenly broght thyther
many yeres agone saythe he
yet
sayde i
the wallys doo nat apere so old
he dyd nat denay it
no mor thes woden pyleres
he cowld nat denay but that they were sette there nat longe agoo
and also the mater dyd playnly testyfye the same
afterward
sayd i
thys roffe whiche is all of rede dothe apere nat to be very olde
and he grantyd also
thes greete bemes whiche lye ouerthwerte
and these rafteres that hold vpe that howsse were nat sett longe agone
he affyrmyd my saynge
well sayd i seynge that no parte of the housse is lefte but all is new
how can yow say that this was the house whiche was broght hyther so longe agoo
i pray you how dyd the howskeper
auoyde hymselffe frome your argument
by and by he dyd shew to vs the mater by the skyne of a bayre whiche had hangyd be the rafteres alonge season
and dyd almost moke the symplenes of owre wyttes that could nat perceyue so manyfeste an argumente we beynge perswadyd by this argument
askid pardon of our ignorance
and callid into our communycacyon the heuenly mylke of our lady
o how like to the sone is the mother
for he hath left to vs so moche blood here in erthe
and she so moche mylke
that a man wyl skarysly beleue a woman to haue so moche mylke of one chylde
in case the chyld shuld sukke none at all
thay saye the same of the holy crosse
whiche is shewyd in so many places bothe openly
and pryuately
that if the fragmentes were gatheryd apon one heape
they wold apere to be a iuste fraghte for a shipe
and yet christe dyd bere all his crosse hymselffe
but do nat you maruayll at this
it may wel be a strange thynge
but no maruayle
seynge that the lord whiche dothe encreasse this at hys pleasure
is almyghty
it is very gently expowndyd
but i am afrayd
that many of thes be faynyd for lukre
i suppose that god wold nat suffre hymselffe to be deludyd of suche a fasshion
yis
haue nat you sene that whan bothe the mother
the sone
the father
and the holy ghoste hathe be robbyd of thes sacrilegyous theues
that thay wold nat ones moue
or styre nother with bekke or crakke wherby thay myght fray away the theues
so great is the gentles of god
so it is
but here out me tale
this mylke is kepyd apon the hye aultre
and in the myddys ther is christe
with his mother apon hys ryght hand
for her honor sake
the mylke dothe represente the mother
it may be sene than
it is closyd in crystalle
it is moyste than
what tell you me of moystenes
whan it was mylkyd more than a thowsand and fyue hunthrithe yere agone
it is so congelyd
that a man wold saye that it were chalke temperyd with the whyte of a egge
ye
but do thay sette it forthe bare
no
lest so holy mylke shuld be defowlyd with the kyssynge of men
you say well
for i suppose that ther be many that kysse it
whiche be nother clene mouthyd
nor yet be pure virgynes
whan the sexten sawe vs
he dyd runne to the aultre
and put apon hym his surplese
and his stole about his nekke
knelyd downe relygyously
and worshipyd it
and streghtforthe dyd offre the mylke to vs to kysse
and at the ende of the aultre we knelyd downe deuoutly
and the fyrste of all we salutyd christe
and than after we callyd apon our lady with thys prayer
whiche we had mayd redy for the same purpose
o mother and mayde
whiche dyd gyue sukke with thy virgynes teates the lorde of heuen and yerthe
thy sone iesus christe
we beynge puryfyed thorowe hys precyous blode
do desyre that we may attayne
and come to that blessyd infancye of thy colombynes meknes
whiche is immaculate without malice
frawde or diseyte
and with all affectyon of harte dothe couett and stody for the heuenly mylke of the euangelicall doctryne
to go for the and encrease with it into a perfaycte man
into the mesure of the plentefulnes of christe
of whos company thou haste the fruycyon
togyther with the father
and the holy ghost for euermore
so be it
uerely thys is a holy prayer
but what dyd she
and me thought that the mylke daunsyd
in the meanseson the sexten came to vs
withowt any wordes
but he held out a table suche as the germanes vse to gather tolle apon bridges
by my trothe i haue cursyd very ofte suche crauynge boxes
whan i dyd ryde thorowe germany
we dyd gyue hym certayne monay whiche he offeryd to our lady
than i axyd by a certayne yonge man
that was well learnyd
whiche dyd expownde and tell vs the saynge of the sexten
hys name as fere as i remembre was robert alderisse
by what tokenes or argumentes he dyd know that it was the mylke of owr lady
and that i very fayne
and for a good purpose desyred to knowe
that i myght stope the mowthes of certayne newfanglyd felowes
fyrst of all the sexten with a froward cowntenance wold nat tell
but i desyryd the yong man to moue hym more instantly
but somwhat more gently he so courtesly behauyd hymselffe
that and he had prayd owr lady herselffe after that fashion
she wold nat haue be dysplesyd therwith
and than this mystycall chapleyn
as and if he had be inspyryd with the holy ghoste
castynge at vs a frounynge loke
as and if he wold haue shote at vs the horryble thonderbolte of the greate curse
what nede you saythe he to moue suche questyones
whan yow see byfore your eyes so autentycall and old a table
and we were afrayd lest that he wold haue cast vs out of the churche for heretykes
but that oure monay dyd tempre hys grea
what dyd you in the meane season
what suppose you
we were amasyd as and if a man had stryke vs with a clube
or we had be slayne with a thonderclape
and we very lowly axid pardon of oure folishe boldenes
and gote vs frome thens
for so must we entreate holy thynges
frome thens we went in to the howse where owre lady dwellithe
and whan we came there
we sawe another sexten whiche was but a noues
he lokyd famylarly as and if he had knowen vs
and whan we came a litle further in
we sawe another
that lokyd moch after suche a fashion
at the last came the thyrd
perauenture thay desyryd to descrybe you
but i suspecte another mater
what was it
there was a certayne theffe that had stole almost all owr ladyes frontlet
and i supposyd that they had me in suspycyon therof
and therfore whan i was within the chapell i mayd my prayers to our lady after thys fashion
oh cheffe of all women mary the mayd
most happy mother
moste pure virgyne
we vnclene
and synners
doo vysyte the pure and holy
and after our abylytye we haue offeryd vnto the
we pray thy that thy sone may grante this to vs
that we may folow thy holy lyffe
and that we may deserue thorow the grace of the holy ghoste
spirytually to conceyue the lord iesus christ
and after that conceptyon neuer to be separat frome hym
amen
this done i kyssyd the aultre
and layd downe certayne grotes for myne offerynge and went my waye
what dyde our lady now
dyd nat she make one sygne
that you myght know that she had hard youre prayeres
the lyght as i told you before was but litle
and she stode at the ryght ende of the aultre in the derke corner
at the last the commumcatyo ̄ of the fyrst sexten had so discoregyd me
that i durst nat ones loke vpe with myne eyes
this pylgremage came but to smale effecte
yes
it had a very good and mery ende
you haue causyd me to take harte of grasse
for as homere saythe my harte was almost in my hose
whan dynar was done
we returnyd to the temple
durfte you god and be susspecte of felonye
perauenture so
but i had nat my selffe in suspicion
a gyltles mynde puttythe away feare
i was very desyrous to see that table whiche the holy sexten dyd open to vs
at the last we fownde it
but it was hangyd so hye that very fewe could rede it
my eyes be of that fashion
that i can nother be callyd linceus ys abeaste so quike eyed that it wyll see thorow any wall linceus
nother purre blynd
and therefore i instantly desyryd alldryge to rede it
whose redynge i folowyd with myne owne eyes
because i wold skarsly truste hym in suche a mater
well
now all doubtes be discussyd
i was ashamyd that i doubtyd so moche
the mater was so playne set forthe before oure eyes
bothe the name
the peace
the thynge it selffe as it was done
to be breffe
there was nothynge lefte owte
there was a mane whos name was wylyam whiche was borne in parise
a man very deuoute in many thyngꝭ
but pryncypally excedynge relygyous in searchynge forthe relyques of all sayntes thorowowt all the worlde
he after that he had vysytyd many places
contrayes
and regyones
at the laste came to constantynenople
for wylhelmes brother was there byshope
whiche dyd make hym pryuy to a certayne mayde
whiche had professyd chastyte
that hadde parte of oure ladyes mylke
whiche were an excedynge precyous relyque
if that other with prayer
or monaye
or by any crafte it myghte be gotte
for all the reliques that he hadde gotte before were but tryfles to so
wyllyam wold nat rest there tyll that he had gotte halffe of that holy mylke
but whan he had it
he thoghte that he was richer than croeseus
why nat
but was it nat withowt any good hope
he went than streght home
but in hys iornay he fell seke
iesu there is nothynge in thys worlde that is other permanent
or alwayes in good state
but whan he sawe and perceyuyd that he was in greate ioperdye of his lyffe
he callyd to him a frenchman
whiche was a very trusty companyon to hym in hys iornay
and commaundyd all to auoyd the place
and make sylence
and pryuyly dyd betake to hym thys mylke
apon this condycyon
that if it chansyd to come home saffe and sownde he shuld offre that precyous tresure to our ladyes aultre in paryse
whiche standythe in the myddys of the ryuere sequana
whiche dothe apere to separat hymselffe to h ● nor and obaye our blessyd lady
but to make short tale
wylyam is deade
and buryed
the frenchman mayd hym redy to departe apon hys iornay
and sodenly fell seke also
and he in great dyspayre of amendynge
dyd commyth the mylke to an englishman
but nat withowt great instance
and moche prayer he dyd that whiche he was mouyd to doo
than dyed he
and the other dyd take the mylke
and put it apon an aultre of the same place the chanones beynge presente
whiche were yt as we call regulares
thay be yet in the abbaye of saynt genofeffe
but the englishman obtaynyd the halffe of that mylke
and caryed it to walsyngam in england
the holy ghost put suche in hys mynde
by my trothe this is a godly tale
but lest there shuld be any doubte of this mater
the byshopes whiche dyd grante pardon to it th ayre names be wryten there
as thay came to vysyte it
nat withowt th ayre offerynges
and thay haue gyuen to it remyssyon
as moche as thay had to gyue by th ayre authorite
how moche is that
fowrty dayes
yee is there dayes in hell
trewly ther is tyme
ye but whan thay haue grantyd all th ayre stynte
thay haue no more to grante
that is nat so for whan one parte is gone another dothe encrease
for that althoghe it be incontynently fyllyd
yet it is alway emptye
and if thou be takynge owt of it
yet there is neuer the lesse in the barell
if thay grante to an hunderithe thowsand men fowrty dayes of pardone
shuld euery man haue elyke
no doubte of that
and if any haue forty byfore dynar
may he axe other forty at after
is there any thynge lest than to gyue him
and if thou aske it tentymes in one howre
i wold to god that i had suche a pardon bagge
i wold aske but three grotes
and if thay wold flowe so faste
ye but you desyre to be to ryche
if that you myght for wyshynge
but i wyl turne to my tale
but there was some good holy man whiche dyd gyue this argumente of holynes to that mylke
and sayd that our ladyes mylke whiche is in many other places
is precyous and to be worshipyd
but thys is moche more precyous
and to be honoryd
bycause the other was shauen of stones
but this is the same that came out of the virgynes brest
how kno you that
the mayd of constantynople
which dyd gyue it
dyd saye so
perauenture saynt barnard dyd gyue it to her
so i suppose
for whan he was an old man
yet he was so happy that he sukkyd of the same mylke
that iesus hymselffe sukkyd apon
but i maruayle why he was rather callyd a hony sukker than a mylke sukker
but how is it callyd oure ladyes mylke that came neuer owt of her breste
yes it came owt at her breste
but perauenture it light apon the stone that he whiche sukkyd knelyd apon
and ther was receyuyd
and so is encreasyd
and by the wyll of god is so multyplyed
it is wel sayd
whan we had sene all thys
whyle that we were walkynge vpe and downe
if that any thynge of valure were offeryd
so that any body were present to see thaym the sextens mayd great haste for feare of crafty conuayence
lokynge apon thaym as thay wold eate thaym
thay poynte at hym with there fynger
thay runne
thay goo
thay come
as tho thay wold speake to thaym that stand by if thay durste haue be bold

a learned astronomical discourse of the iudgement of natiuities
deuided into three bookes and dedicated first to katherin the french queene
her physition
translated by gentleman
published by authoritie
he counteth the number of the starres &amp; calleth them all by their names

anno 1593

earle of northumberland
lord of the honors of cockermouth and petworth &amp; c
knight of the most honorable order of the garter
all true felicitie both in thys life and in the worlde to come most hartily wished
if that saying of plato
right noble lorde
be true
that our countrey challengeth an especiall interest in our very vttermost abilitie
which any way may tend to profit &amp; benefite the same
then will it sufficiently countenaunce the poore receiued talent of myne
in that being so strictly charged by so great and graue a phylosopher
i ought not to burie in obliuion my knowledge whatsoeuer
but rather as freely bestow mine endeuour on her
as shee did franckly impart the light thereof to me
for though it be a common phrase in the mouthes of men altogether ignorant in the precious value and profite of sciences
that the studie of letters is a bottomlesse gulfe
and so long and so vneasie a iourney
that they which rashly thinke to finish it
oftentimes are drowned in the mid-way
and so vnder this pretence
account it better not to know much
yea
nothing at all
against such slothful suggesters of men in a deadly obscuritie while they lyue
let mee auouch that saying of aristotle
man
sayth he
was created to vnderstande and to doe
for knowledge begetteth iudgement
and by iudgement men execute all good and vertuous actions
o science
sayth plato
howe would men loue thee
if they did but knowe thee
for euen as health is the conseruation of the body
so is knowledge the sure and onely safe-garder of the soule
and cicero beeing of the same opinion
sayth
o knowledge
the guide of our life
the onely cause of vertue
and enemie to vice
what is the life of man without thee
if then
right learned lord
such a maine &amp; current streame of vnconquerable reason
washeth to nothing the emptie and confused wits
of such as are enemies to the excellencie of arte
and maketh most fertile
like the ouer-flowings of nylus
the iudgements of them that are gouerned thereby
though farre from me be the thought of arrogating the very least tytle of arte to my selfe
yet as one that desires to receiue the breath of life from her sacred dwelling
and holdes with the learned in all ages
that man is as a bruite beast without her
then let me thus farre presume vnder your noble fauour
to shewe that i haue not altogether trewanted in my life time
but howe i haue bestowed those permitted howers of exercise
that more waighty affaires in the world affoorded me
both to declare my reuerende zeale to so high a misterie
and vnfeyned affection
i beare to your honor
the worke was first written in french
by an excellent scholler
oger ferrier
a physition
borne in tolouze
&amp; dedicated to queene katherine of fraunce
mother to the king that last deceassed
and beeing now by me changed into an english habite
that it might receiue no indignitie by dedication
i haue stampt your noble name in the fore-head thereof
that it may bee sayde
in despight of the proudest carper or controller
thys is the god-chylde of a peerelesse god-father
and as i doubt not of your honourable acceptauce
so i am likewise perswaded
that what hath wanted on my behalfe in translation
or any other imperfection beside
shall be as nobly censured
in which resolution i humbly kisse your hand
and continue as forward in affection
as any to your honours welfare
thomas kelway
one of her highnesse trumpets in ordinarie
to the covrtevs reader
i am to request
gentle reader
one fauour at thy hande
that if this worke of the iudgement of natiuities seeme harsh and vnpleasant to thee
thou wouldest not therefore wound the same with iniurious words
to charge thy selfe with more follie then needes
but if thou finde it aboue thy knowledge or capacitie
saie as honest minded chion said
let my betters iudge of these matters
for i must and do confesse
that it is not a booke for euerie mans reading
and hee that reades with derision
because he vnderstands not
must blame his owne insufficiencie
and not the booke
for if hee could learne as much in an hower
as cost a learned man many yeeres to compasse
then would his humor be pleased
and the worke not reproched
but let such loyterers vnderstand
that knowledge requires the whole circuit of a mans life
and liue he neuer so long
yet may he learne
but if it might be attained in a sommers daie
a number would be excellent
that through default thereof remaineth vtterly ignorant
to vse many words
i account needlesse
knowing that the reproofe of the vnlearned
is rather the badge of their owne weake braine
then any blemish to a worke of worth
therefore let them censure as they please
the learned
i know
will iudge like themselues
of whom i had rather be deseruedly controlled
then by the other be ignorantly commended
thomas kelway
the table of the matters in this present treatise
the first booke
of the celestiall figure of a natiuitie
this done
search in the ephemerides in the table of the yeere of your natiuitie
in the right month &amp; day proposed
the degree of the signe wherein the sunne is
looke afterwarde in the table of houses
which serue for the latitude of your country
and search there the said degree of the sunne vnder the lyne of the tenth house
and hauing founde in the same place the same degree of the sunne
you shall find directly vppon the left hand of the same table
a number of howers and minutes
the which write apart
to which number
you must adde the howers and mynutes that hath beene giuen you of the same natiuity
and that which resteth by your addition
you must seeke in the table of houses
and there where you find the same number of howers &amp; mynutes comming of the same addition
you must take to a right lyne the poynts and beginnings of the sixe houses
which you shall finde marked
the which you shall direct vpon your figure
beginning at the poynt of the tenth
and continuing towards the left hand
the beginning of the other sixe houses
you must take the opposite signes
and if it happen that the number of houses and mynutes
come to more then twentie-foure howers
it is then conuenient to substract twentie-foure howers of the same tyme
and the residue seeke out as we haue aforesaid
if the hower of the same natiuitie
be vpon the poynt of twelue howers of noone
you must take the houses in a right line of the degree of the sunne
in the table of your latitude
without making any other addition
or substraction
and that when in the figure estimatiue
within the which
it is needfull by all meanes to apply the moouing of the moone exactly calculated
according to the vulgare cannons of the ephemerides
for to verifie afterwarde your natiuitie by the hower of the conception
as followeth
chap ii
of the verification of the bower of the natiuity
leauing the animodar of ptolome and the meetings of schoner
and all other vncertaine waies
although they haue theyr authors
to verifie the howers of natiuities
i will presently follow the method of hermes
approoued by long experience
and confirmed by ptolome in his centiloque
and by abraham auenesrus
by alphonce leopolde
haly , and other most expert astrologians
hermes saith
that the ascendant of a natiuitie
hath beene the place of the moone at the tyme of the conception
and that the ascendant of the conception
is the place of the moone at the hower of the natiuitie
who would be moore neere certified of the hower &amp; mynute of a natiuitie
and of the true ascendant
it is conuenient that you follow the doctrine of hermes by the method folowing
first of all that you looke into the figure estimatiue
whether the moone be aboue the horrizon or beneath
if she be aboue the horrizon
count the distance that is betweene the poynt of the seauenth house and the moone
if she be beneath the horrizon
count the distance which is from the first house vnto the moone
which distance of signes and degrees
you must search in the table that followeth
vnder the title of the moone
aboue the horrizon or beneath
as truely you haue found in the said figure
in a right lyne of the said distance
you shall find the time that the infant hath remained within the wombe of his mother
in a certaine number of dayes
the which you must reckon from the day of your natiuitie backward
and there where the number endeth
you must marke the day of the conception
if the moone be found in the signe of the ascendant estimatiue
if you find her not in the same place
goe backwarde or forward certaine dayes of your account
vntill you haue founde the moone within the said signe
not farre from the degree ascendant in the said figure
the day considered
and in what hower
goe forwarde to the east poynt
the place where you haue sounde the moone in the figure estimatiue
and at that hower you must calculate the moouing of the moone
for this degree and mynute in the which you found her
you must place it in the ascendant of your natiuitie
and to know the hower in the which the place of the moone of the natiuity
rose to the east poynt at the time of the conception
take first the ouerthwart ascention of the said place of the moone
within the table of the directions of your country
in the booke of iohn de regiomonte
of the same ascention take away 90
degrees
&amp; ad to the whole circle which is of 360
degrees
when the substraction cannot be otherwise made
the residue shall be the right ascention of the height of the poynt of the merydian circle
take afterward the right ascention of the sun
and take out by the substraction of the right ascention of the sayd poynt of the merydian
and adde 360 degrees if it be necessary
&amp; turne that which is left into howers and minutes
in gyuing to 30 degrees two howers
to fifteene degrees one hower
to one degree 4 minutes of an houre
to fifteene minutes one minute of an hower
by thys meanes you shall exactly come to the hower of the conception
to the which you must calculate the place of the moone
and the same well calculated
put it to the poynt of the first house
in the figure of the natiuitie
diuers for this verefication doe dresse and garnish the motions of the planets foure figures
one of that hower estimatiue of the natiuitie
the other of the precedent coniunction or opposition of the brightnes
the third of the verification by the animodar
the fourth of the conception
the which besides the vnprofitable and superfluous labour
erre greatly
thinking to find out the tyme of the conception by the animodar of ptolome
the which experience from day to day sheweth to be false
and that it hath no auncient author to maintaine it
or hath made mention of thys newe doctrine
being full of contention and disproued veritie
the table of the time that the childe dooth remaine within the wombe of his mother
the moone beeing vnder the horrizon
reckon from the ascendaunt
the moone being aboue the horrizon
reckon from the seauenth
chap iii
the manner to sette downe perfectlie the said figure verified
hauing put to the poynt of the first house
the degree &amp; minutes of the moone of the time of the conception
take the ouerthwart ascentions of the said degrees and minutes
take out afterward 90 degrees of the sayd ascentions
and adde thereto 360 degrees
if otherwise the substraction cannot be made
that which remaineth
shal be the right ascentions of the highest poynt of the circle meridian
the which search in the table of the right ascentions
in the booke of alphonce
or of iohn de regiomonte
&amp; c
and put to the poynt of the tenth house
the degrees &amp; minutes of the signe you find
aunswering to the right number of the said right ascentions
the poynt of the fourth is alwaies against the signe and degree of the tenth
likewise the poynt of the seauenth
to the poynt of the first
the other houses sufficed
take the ephemerides
because they doe not desire exact calculation
seeing that the most part of the astrologians
desire more to take of the equall portion of the eclipse then of the horizontall sect
for to know the exact hower of the said figure
verifie first the sayd right ascentions of the meridian
and take from them the right ascentions of the sunne
that which remaineth turne into howers and minutes
gyuing to xv degrees one hower
to euery degree foure minutes of an hower
&amp; c
as we haue sayde before
at thys hower you must newly count the moouing of the moone
and of the sunne &amp; of the other planets
and vpon thys figure you must ground the parts and iudgements astronomicall
chap
of the partes of natiuities
after you haue well sought the planets in the sayd figure verified
you must consider their aboue certaine proportions of the planets and partes of the heauen
taken of theyr distances
as followeth
the parts concerning the significations of the first house
the part of the qualitie of the lyfe
is taken by the distance of iupiter from saturne
counting as much space from the ascendant
as when the natiuity is by day
for when it is by night
they take it to the contrary
the distance of saturne vnto iupiter
folowing the natural order of the signes
counting likewise as much space since the ascendant
the part of lyfe by day and by night
is taken of the degree of the precedent coniunction
or opposition of the lights vnto the moone
counting from the ascendant
the part of the spirite
many do call the part of earthly things and secrets
the other
the part of things to come
the others
the part of the sun
in the day from the mooue vnto the sunne
from the ascendant
in the night to the contrary
the part of the vnderstanding
by the day
is from mercurie vnto mars
from the ascendant
at night to the contrarie
of the second house
the part of fortune by the day
is from the sunne vnto the moone
from the ascendant
at night to the contrarie
ptolome doth take it as much by day as by night
from the sunne vnto the moone
the part of the goods aswell by day as by night
is from the lord of the second house
vnto the said second house
taken vpon the quality of the eclipse
from the ascendant
of the third
the part of brothers
by the day
is from saturne vnto iupiter
from the ascendant
at night to the contrary
the part of the loue of bretheren
by the day
is from the sunne vnto saturne
from the ascendant
at night to the contrary
if saturne bee vnder the beames of the sunne
take iupiter in his place
of the fourth
the part of father
by the day
is from the sun vnto saturne
from the ascendant
at night to the contrary
thys same is like the loue of bretheren
then if saturne be vnderneath the beames of the sun
in his place take iupiter
the part of inheritances and possessions
by day and by night
is from saturne to the moone
from the ascendant
the part of fortune in tillage and sowing
by day and by night
is from venus vnto saturne
from the ascendant
of the fift
the part of infants
is as the part of the qualitie of the lyfe
the part of male chyldren by day and by night
is from the moone vnto iupiter
and is numbred from the ascendant
the part of daughters
by day and by night
is from the moone vnto venus
and is taken from the ascendant
of the sixt
the part of diseases inseperable
in the day
is the distaunce of saturne vnto mars
and it is cast from the degree ascendant
and in the night from mars
which is contrary
the part of seruaunts
by day and by night
from mercurie vnto the moone
is from the ascendant
the part of pryson and captiuity by day
from the lord of the place of the sunne
vnto the sunne
and is reckoned from the ascendant
by night
from the lorde of the place of the moone
vnto the moone
if the sunne by day
or the moone by night
be in theyr proper houses or exaltations
they shall be signifiers of thys part
of the seauenth
the part of the marriage of men
by day and by night
from the sunne vnto venus
is from the ascendant
the part of the marriage of women
by day &amp; by night
from venus to saturne
is from the ascendant
the part of marriage common to men &amp; to women
by day and by night
is from venus vnto the poynt of the seauenth house
accounting from the ascendant
the part of kindred
by day and by night
from saturne vnto venus
is from the ascendant
the part of discord &amp; agreement
by day
is from mars to iupiter from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
of the eight
the part of death
by day and by night
from the moone vnto the degree of the eyght house
taken vpon the equalitie of the eclipse accounting from the place of saturne
the part of the mortall planet by day is from the lord of the ascendant
vnto the moone
from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
the part of the perrillous yeere of death
or pouerty
or of any other mis-fortune by day
and by night
is from saturne vnto the lord of the fore-said coniunction or opposition of the light
from the ascendant
the part of all enuies
by day
is from saturne vnto mars
by night to the contrary
accounting from the place of mercurie
of the ninth
the part of fayth and of religion by day
is from the moone vnto mercurie
from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
the part of waies by land by day and by night
is from the lord of the ninth vnto the ninth
taken vpon the equalitie of the eclipse
from the ascendant
the part of trauaile by water by day
is from saturne vnto the fifteenth degree of cancer
from the ascendant
at night to the contrary
if saturne doe meete in the sayde fifteenth degree of cancer
he shall be signifier of this part
with the ascendant
of the tenth
the part of nobilitie by day
is from the sunne vnto the nineteenth degree of aries
accounting from the ascendant
by night
from the moone vnto the third degree of taurus
if the moone by night be in the said degree of taurus
or the sunne by day
in the said degree of aries
they shall be signifiers of the said part
the part of gouernment by day
is from mars vnto the moone from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
the part of magistrates
as the part of the vnderstanding
written vpon the first house
the part of conquest &amp; victorie
as the parte of father
the part of suddaine aduauncement
by day
is from saturne vnto the part of fortune
from the ascendant
by night to the contrary
if saturne be burned , take in hys place iupiter
the part of estimation
by day and by night
is from mercurie vnto the sunne
accounting from the ascendant
the part of gouernments and seates of warre
by day
is from mars vnto saturne

chap
of the latitudes and aspects of the planets
hauing applyed the planets in the saide figure
and ordained as we haue said in the former chapter
the parts proceeding of the proportions of the said planets
you must consequently draw out of the ephemerides theyr latitudes
&amp; put apart all the aspects which is among them
and towardes the said parts and xij houses
also the radiations
after the last proposition of the booke of directions of iohn de regiomonte
vpon the which note
that the aspects opposites
haue alwaies diuers latitudes to them of their planets
although they keepe the same number
as if saturne had two degrees of latitude septentrionall
his opposition hath two degrees of latitudes meridionall
the quadrant aspect hath no latitude
for it falleth alwaies vpon the eclipse
the trine aspect
retaineth the halfe of the number of the latitude
in contrary part
for if a planet haue one degree of latitude meridionall
his trine shall haue thirtie minutes of latitude septentrionall
the sextile retaineth the same side
with the halfe of the number
you must also note
that these aspects of saturne and of iupiter
doe not extend but vnto nine degrees
or for the most longest vnto twelue
those of mars vnto eyght
or for the most part to tenne
the sunne extendeth his beames to xv degrees
venus and mercurie almost to eyght
the moone vnto twelue
the head &amp; taile of the dragon
likewise extend their forces vnto twelue degrees
moreouer , it is to be noted
that the opposition is a plaine aspect and perfect enmity
the quadrate of lesse enmity
the trine of perfect loue
the sextile of imperfect loue
that which alwaies receiueth exception in iupiter and venus
of the which opposites and quadrate aspects
profit the sunne &amp; the moone with reception
or without reception
and to others also with reception
chap vi
of the fortunes and infortunes of the planets
and parts of heauen
after this
you must consider the forces &amp; weakenesse of the planets
parts and houses
and conferring the ones significations with the other
you must collect the fortunes and infortunes of euerie place
as followeth
heere followeth the infortunes
the planets and other places of the heauen
be called vnfortunate
when they be burned vnder the beames of the sunne
burnings are called saturne and iupiter
when betweene them &amp; the sunne they haue lesse then twelue degrees
mars when he is burned of the sunne
hath at the least xj degrees and a halfe
venus and mercurie
when they be neere the sunne
xj degrees
the moone when she is not burned
by xiij
and yet you find other termes
when you will take a planet for to giue the yeeres
then the three superiours are esteemed burnt
because they are neere the sunne by xv degrees
and if they be occidental
for when they be orientall vnto tenne degrees
they are burnt from the tenne vnto xv
vnder the beames
venus and mercurie occidentall neere to the sunne by seauen degrees
or orientall by fiue
be burned
from thence vnto twelue vnder the beames
the moone neere by twelue degrees is burnt
from thence vnto xv
vnder the beames
and you must note
that the saide accidents are not hurtfull when they fall in the signes of aries
and of the lyon
vnfortunate also are the planets
when they goe backwarde
and when they bee ioyned with saturne or with mars
or when they receiue euill aspects of them
when they are ioyned with any fixed starre of violent nature
when they are in their detriments or fallings
that is to say
in places opposite to their houses or exaltations
when they are in their declining houses
when they are first standers
that is to say
when they be in the degree and minute wherein incontinently they beginne to goe backward
when they are in the way of burning
which beginne at the 19 degree of libra
and end in the third degree of scorpio
when they be with the tayle of the dragon
when they are ioyned with a backward planet
or otherwise vnfortunate
when they are peregrines
without beeing receiued
they are called peregrins
when they haue no dignitie or place where they be
of the reception we will speake afterwards
when they be meridionall descendents
when any of the three superiours are occidentall
or venus &amp; mercurie orientall
when they be in euil aspects of the sunne
when they doe not regard any other planet
when they be opposits to the lord of the signe where they be
when they be sette
that is to say
betweene two euill planets
although they haue 30 degrees of distance
when they be in euill houses or termes
when they be in the twelfth signe of theyr principall houses
when they be vnder the horrizon in the day
or aboue the horrizon in the night
if they be diurnes
as saturne
iupiter
and the sunne
when they be aboue the horrizon in the day
and beneath at night
if they be nocturnes
as mars
venus
mercurie
and the moone
when they be in signes and degrees feminine
they be masculines
or in signes and degrees masculine
they bee feminines
feminines are venus and the moone
mercurie and androgine
the others are masculines
when they be in degrees which are called azemenae
or in degrees stincking
darke
or smokie
that which is marked in the ephemerides
in the table of the dignities of the planets
infortunes particuler to the moone
when she decreaseth
when she is within the eyght house
out of her principall dignities
when she is within the seauenth
and that as to the life
and as for any other significations she is not infortunate in the seauenth
when she is in the xix
degree of a signe
when she is slack in her course
that is to vnderstand
when shee goes in twenty-foure howers
lesse then thyrteene degrees and xi minutes

fortunate be the planets
and other places of heauen
when they be in angles
or at the least in houses succeeding
when they be in a good aspect of iupiter
or of venus
or at the least in euill
with reception
when they bee ioyned to the sunne within sixteene mynutes
when they be in a good aspect of the sunne
of the moone
or of mercurie fortunate
when they be ioyned with any fixed starre of a louing nature
when they be directs
or at the least

that is to vnderstand
when they be in degree and minute
in the which beginneth incontinently the direction
when they be within theyr proper houses or exaltations
when they be in theyr triplicities and termes together
or triplicity and face together
when they be in houses
wherein they naturally take pleasure
as mercurie in the ascendant

or if they be peregrines
when they be receiued
receiued
that is
the planets
which receiue aspect of him
which in their place hath at the least foure dignities
the which reception is fortunate
when shee is made of a good aspect
at all times the receptions of iupiter and venus be alwaies fauourable
although they be not made of good aspects
when they mount to the highest part of their circles
when they be septentrionals
principally ascendants
when any of the three superiours is orientall
or venus and mercurie occidentall
when they beginne to goe from the beames of the sunne
when they be in houses or termes of fauourable planets
when they be aboue the horrizon in the day

or aboue the horrizon in the night
if they be nocturnes
when they are in signes and degrees masculine

or in signes and degrees feminines
they be feminines
when they be in degrees fortunate &amp; cleere degrees
which are called lucides
particuler fortunes of the moone
when shee increaseth
when she is within the house or exaltation of the sun
when she is very swift in her course
that is to vnderstand
when shee goes more then thirteene degrees &amp; 11 minutes in 24 howers

if the child shall lyue or no
all thys aboue considered
you must first looke
whether he that is borne
is for life in this worlde or no
that which principally will shewe vs the light of the time
that is to say
the sun by day
and the moone by night
are the lords of the triplicity of him
and the ascendant with his dominator
when the dominator of the ascendant
shal be vnfortunate by the lord of the eyght house
the childe cannot liue
and lesse
if the lordes of the triplicitie of the temporall light be vnfortunate
when within the first house shall be any fixed starre of violent nature
or any ill fortune
that is to say
saturne or mars
without hauing at the least foure dignities
and the temporall light shall be vnfortunate
the childe shall die quicklie
if you find not any fixed starre of amiable nature
or if iupiter and venus
or the sunne or the moone
doe not communicate vnto him their beames
for and if the aspect be of loue
or of enmitie with reception
the chyld shall liue
if the dominator of the ascendant be burnde
the child shall dye before 9 daies be acomplished
and more sooner if he be burned within the eight house
or in this estate
if he be ioyned with the lorde of the eygth
except when he is burned in his owne house or exaltation
or within the house or exaltation of the sunne
when the moone
being the temporall light
shall bee vnfortunate within the first house
without any aspect of the fortunes
&amp; without the coniunction of any fixed stars of amiable nature
the hope of lyfe shall not be great
when the moone shal be vnfortunat within the fourth house
and he that hath the misfortune shall be also vnfortunate
&amp; out of his principall dignities
the infant cannot liue
&amp; the mother shall be in great daunger of death at her deliuerance
and principally if the ascendant be the house or exaltation of the moone
when the infortunes are conioyned within the eighth house
it signifieth very short life
except when mars and saturne be in capricorne
many ioynt plannets within the first house
bring not good testimonie of life
although they be all fortunate
when the domynator of the ascendant
and the temporall light
and the lords of their triplicities be not altogether vnfortunate
the childe may easily liue
chap viii
of the giuer of life
named of the arabians hyleg
the giuer of life is taken out of the principal places of the figure
that is to say
of the sunne
of the moone
and of the ascendant
of the part of fortune
&amp; of the degree of the last coniunction or opposition of lights
the which hauing wel noted
we consider first
if the natiuitie be diurnal or nocturnal
for if she be diurne wee beginne at the sunne
the which within the first
tenth
or eleuenth house
in a masculine or feminine signe
shall be fitte to giue life
if it haue any giuer of tyme that doth regard it
if it be in the nynth
eygth
or seuenth house
it may also be the giuer of life
if it be in a masculine signe
and not in a feminine
in other places it cannot be the giuer of life
but by constraint
it is alwaies necessarie for such an acte
that the giuer of time regard the giuer of life
otherwise
the sayd giuer of life shall be as person that hath good will to doo his friend good &amp; hath not wherewithall
and so when the sunne shall be without aspect of any giuer of time
you must leaue it there
&amp; goe to the moone
which may giue the life within the first house
in the signe masculine or feminine
and within the tenth
eleuenth
seuenth
fourth
fifth
second and third house
in signes feminines and not masculines
receiuing aspect of any giuer of time
if the moone haue not all the sayde conditions
you must come to the degree ascendant
if the natiuitie be coniunctionall
coniunctionall is sayed the natiuitie
before the which lastly the lights haue beene conioyned
and if the sayde degree receiue aspect of his gyuer of time
he shall be gyuer of life
otherwise not
wherefore you must examine the part of fortune
the which shall giue life in the angles and houses succeeding
with the aspect of the giuer of time
otherwise you must come to the degree
to the which lastly the lights haue beene conioyned
the which within the angles or houses succeeding shall be giuer of life
if hee receiue aspect of his giuer of tyme
it is heere necessary that the giuer of time haue dignitie of house
or of exaltation in places of the part of fortune
and of the sayd degree coniunctionall
by this order you must seeke the gyuer of life
when the natiuitie is coniunctionall
when she is preuentionall
preuentionall is sayed
afore the which lastly the lights haue beene opposites
after you haue considered the sunne and the moone
you must consequentlie contemplate the place of fortune
more than the degree ascendant
and lastly the degree of the oppositions of the lights
&amp; see that it haue 2
degrees in the opposition
one of them of the sunne
and the other of the moone
the astrologians commaund to consider it
that at the time of the opposition it hath beene in the first house
or elswhere aboue the horizon
when the natiuitie is nocturniall
we followe the same order
except that first we consider the moone
secondly the sunne
&amp; c
this gyuer of life
when either by direction
or by profection
or by other way
meete any euill aspect of the infortunes
or of the starres fixed of vyolent nature
or any of the notable coniunctions
or eclipses of the lightes
it causeth then some sicknesse
and very suddaynly bringeth death
when the fortunes doo not intermingle the fauourable beames
chap
ix
of the giuer of yeeres
called of the arabians alcocoden
the gyuer of time or giuer of yeeres
is the same that hath dignitie of house
exaltation
triplicitie
or tearme in the place where is the giuer of life
as if the sunne were in the xj
in the signe of sagitarius
there where he may be gyuer of life
and iupiter were in the signe of aquarius
he shall regarde the sunne of the sextile aspect
and looke that he haue dignitie of the house in the signe of the sunne
he shal be giuer of yeeres
it is then necessary
that these two thinges concurre together
to the end that one plannet be giuer of yeeres
that is to say
that he hath dignitie neuertheles of tearme
for the dignitie of face is not sufficient enough for one so great effect
in signe and degree
in the which shall be the giuer of life
and that he regarde the sayd giuer of life
of one aspect or other
this gyuer of time
well lodged vpon the point of angles
gyueth him olde yeeres
in points of the houses succeeding
is meanes
is cadants
is smalnesse
and for as much as he shall be long from the beginnings of the said houses
so much the more or lesse hee must diminish the number of his olde yeeres
meanes
and smalnes
after the difference taken of the next houses with the difference of yeeres
and first of all if it be within any angle of heauen
not alwayes to the first poynt
you must proceede also
and take in the first place the distance of the sayd angle
and of the next house succeeding
note afterwarde
how many degrees the said giuer of yeeres is from the point of the angle
then take the difference of his olde yeeres and meanes
multiply this difference by the number of the sayd elongment
and part it by the distance of the sayd angle
&amp; of the house succeeding
that which resteth
take for the exact number of the yeres of life
promised by the saide giuer of yeeres
if hee be within any house
succeeding out of the points and beginnings of the same
you must first take the distance of the house succeeding
and of the next cadant
then note how many degrees the said giuer of yeeres shall be elonged from the point of the said house succeeding
afterward take the difference of yeres
meanes and smalnes
the which multiply by the second number
and part it by the first
the residue shall be the time of life which was promised by the said giuer of yeres
if it bee in cadant houses it shall be vppon the points of them
or after
he giueth but onely small yeeres
except when he is within 5
degrees neere to the point of the said angles
&amp; then you must reckon as it followeth
take the difference of the olde yeeres
and smalnes of the plannets that giueth the yeres
and deuide them into 5 parts
afterward looke in which of the said 5 degrees shal be the said plannet
for if it be in the first and most neere the poynt of the angle
that is to say
if he be elonged from the said angle one degree onely
then is it conuenient to take out of his old yeeres
one of the sayd 5 parts
if he be elonged by 2 degrees
you must take out 2 parts
if he be elonged 3 degrees
you must substract 3 parts
&amp; c
you must note that the moone in the viij
giues but small yeeres
and that the sunne within the 9 and iupiter in the 11
and venus in the 5
and mercury by the whole ascendant
and the moone in the 3
giue their olde yeeres as perfectly
as if they were vpon the points of the angles
for they be places wherein principally they doo reioyce
iupiter
venus
and mercury within the 9 giue theyr yeeres indifferent
and the moone in the 11
giues them old
mars in the 6
and saturne in the 12
they are indifferent
because in the saide places they greatly delight themselues
wherefore if they were not euill
they woulde there giue olde yeeres
vppon this propose it is conuenient also to note
that one burnt plannet cannot bee a giuer of yeeres
and the moone in the prime of the beames of the sunne
cannot giue life nor time
if a plannet
which otherwise may be a giuer yeeres
bee burnt in his proper house or exaltation
receiuing there the sunne
causeth the sunne to take the charge to be the giuer of yeeres
if it come to passe that the sunne or the moone be in their proper houses or exaltations
they may be giuers of life &amp; time together
with out neede to desire aspect of any other plannet
if one place being significator of life
haue many giuers of yeres
wee will take him that hath most dignities in the same place
and if they be equall in dignities wee will take hym that hath his aspect most whole
and his beames most neerest the sayd giuer of life
if they finde two or three or many giuers of life
that haue their giuers of yeres
they must alwayes consider and direct
as the first and principall
following the yeeres of the plannets
olde yeeres
meane yeeres
small yeeres
of them that augment and diminish the number of the sayd yeeres
they which augment the number of the sayd yeres
are iupiter
venus
the sunne
the moone
&amp; mercurie fortified
the which fortunatly regarding the gyuer of yeeres
with an amiable aspect adding to their small yeeres
that is to vnderstand
the sunne x
and ix
venus viij
the moone xxv
&amp; c
likewise if the gyuer of time be conioyned with any fixed starre of amiable nature
it taketh of the said starre the number of the small yeeres of the plannet
of the which the said starre holdeth his nature
if the said plannets regard the giuer of time with an euill aspect with reception
they adde as before
which they doo not when they haue no reception
except iupiter and venus
that in euery sort of aspects
with reception or without reception
alwayes adding to theyr small yeeres
for to see that the gyuer of tyme be not saturne or mars
towards the which the reception is necessary
if the aspect be of enmitie
the sayd plannets euill placed and infortunate
in the place of the whole small yeeres
in adding the halfe
or the third
or fourth part
or certaine number of monethes
of weekes
or of dayes
according to the greatnesse or smalnesse of theyr infelicitie
the amiable aspects of ill fortunes
with reception
giue theyr yeeres small
without reception
they doo neither good nor euill
if the giuer of yeeres be retrogarde or meridionall descending
or in hys fall or detryment
or in the way burned
that taketh from it the fift part of that which hee had giuen beeing otherwise disposed
that which happened also to the 3
superiour planets
when they be occidentall
&amp; to the moone when she decreaseth
and when shee is in the xx and ix degree of a signe
and when she is slack in her course
the sunne regarding the moone with the aspects of enmitie without reception diminished
saturne
mars
or mercurie depriued
looking to the euill aspect of the giuer of light they take away the number of their small yeeres
except they recouer
for then by opposition they doe but halfe the euill
by quadrate aspect
they diminish but the fourth part

i haue found it often by experience
that the fortunes

adding to their small yeeres
although they doe not regarde the giuer of time
and to the contrarie
that the infortunes in the sayd places
take away the small yeeres
without regarding the saide giuer of time
except when they were well honoured in the sayd places
or when they were lordes of the natiuities

that is to vnderstand

then it is conuenient to mingle some little of the nature of mars vnfortunate
with the significations of saturue fortunate
the astrologians doe aduertise vs
that if the lord of the ascendant be well placed
and the saide significator of manners euill disposed
you must more consider vppon that which the lord of the ascendant signifieth
then vppon that which the said significator doth promise
moreouer
they consider more particulerly
the place of mercurie and of the moone
and the aspect which they receiue
if mercurie be in the ascendant
it maketh the man ingenious
and of great and profounde knowledge
a great phylosopher
a mathematician
an orator
a poet
a diuine
principally when he is in the place in the which saturne hath at the least 4
dignities
or when he receiues aspect of saturne
mercury in the twelfth
receiuing aspect of the moone
hath very neere as great force for to giue wit and knowledge
as if he were in the first
and where that mercurie is
if he regard the moone
and both two
or the one or the other
regard the ascendant or the lord of the ascendant
thys is signe of a good and subtile spyrite
and if saturne
iupiter and mars
or other planets
do communicate to him theyr fauorable beames
if they mingle theyr good vertues
if they regarde the euill aspect
they intermingle theyr vices
except iupiter and venus
which of euill aspect doe neuer anoy them
and lesse when he hath reception
if the sunne be temporall light
it may signifie the quality of the spyrite with the moone and mercurie in the forme aboue sayd
if mercurie be occidentall within the house or exaltation of the sunne
hauing aspect of the moone
or of the ascendant
or of his lord
it is the soueraigne signe of good and high spirits
of men of al knowledge
gyuen to great enterprises and vertues
as poets
orators
mathematicians
counsellers
administrators of common-weales
and gouernours of realmes
principally when hee is fortunate in euery angle of heauen
mercurie within the seauenth house fortunate
giueth good vnderstanding
and ripe iudgement
it maketh the man subtile
watchfull
and of good counsell
with great craft to gouerne his affayres
mercurie in the ninth or third house
giueth knowledge and contemplation
the part of the vnderstanding of the spyrite with theyr lords fortunate
signifieth good spirits and good manners
mercurie in the signe of pisces
doth not any way loue learning
the contrary happeneth
when he is in the signe of virgo and of gemini
by all the places of the figure of heauen
saturne within the houses of mercurie
is alwaies contemplatiue
mars
a lyttle deceiuer
mercurie within the houses of saturne fortunate
is alwaies studious
within those of mars
he is full of euill words
and often false
when the lyghts and significators of manners shall be oppressed with ill fortune
the chylde shall be of a verie strange and peruerse nature
the moone opposite to the sunne
makes hym hate all men
if the sunne and the moone with the ascendant and his lorde
be all in feminine signes
the manners of hym shall be feminine
and he shal be a man of little hart
if they be in signes masculine at the natiuitie of a woman
her deedes shal be manly
and she shall be a woman of great enterprise
if venus be in the signe of the lyon
or vnder the beames of the sunne
or in coniunction or other aspect of mars
she maketh that the man shal be suddainly striken in loue
and if in that estate shee be within the first or tenth house
without any aspect of iupiter
hee shall be voluptuous without hauing shame
and when she shal be in the signe of scorpio
the aspect of iupiter towards venus
gyueth alwaies chastitie
and loue of vertue
chap xiii
of riches and pouertie
for the riches and pouertie
it is conuenient first that you looke to the seconde house
for if shee and her lord be fortunate
we say that the chyld shall be rich
and if they be vnfortunate
he shall be poore on that side
then afterward you must consider the part of fortune
the which with hys lorde well disposed
promiseth great store of goods
without other witnes
if they be euill disposed
you must come to the parte of goods the which with his lord fortunate enricheth
vnfortunate gyueth nothing
likewise you must iudge of the part of felicity and of his lord
and that thing which the other places signifie
you must alwaies haue recourse to the naturall significator of riches
which is iupiter
the which well placed and fortunate
gyueth goods in aboundance
principally if he be lord of the natiuity
or lorde of the hower
or of the ascendant
or of the seconde house
or of the part of fortune
or of the part of goods
or of the part of felicitie
or of temporall light
or of the tenth house
otherwise he gyueth nothing
when the aboue-sayde significators shall be vnfortunate
the chylde cannot be rich
if the tenth house
of the which wee will speake heereafter
doe not promise hym some good lucke
men finde also often by experience
that when a planet is within his own house or exaltation
or in hys ioy
without beeing vnfortunate
or els where enuironed with the fortunes or theyr beames
that hee gyueth goods
although he be not significator of riches
if in the fourth house be hys lord or other fortunate planet
he promiseth inheritaunces
if any fixed starre of the first or second greatnes be ioyned to the temporall lyght
or to the degree ascendant
or to the poynts of the other angles
or to other planets in the sayd places placed
she dooth rayse the man of base estate
to great authority and honour
and if he be of the race of princes
it will make hym a puissant lord and king
when a lyke planet shall be lord of the ascendant
&amp; of the second house
the chylde shall be couetous of money &amp; gayne
as that which happeneth when capricorne is ascendant
when the lord of the second house shal be within the first
the goods come without laboure
likewise when the lord of the second house giueth strength to the lord of the ascendant
when the lorde of the ascendant shall be in the second
the goods shall not come without trauayle
nor when the lord of the ascendant shall gyue strength to the lord of the second
saturne
mars
mercurie depraued
the sunne and the tayle of the dragon lunarie
within the second
destroy the man
and disperse his goods
except when they haue at the least foure dignities
or when they be receiued
when the lord of the ascendant shall regarde with euill aspect the second house
or the part of goods and of fortune
or their lords
the chyld of hys owne proper will shall disperse his goods
if the lord of the ascendant be vnfortunate in the second house
the chyld shall be too large a giuer
and prodigall
if any mis-fortune haue domination vpon the ascendant
and in the second
the chylde shall be destroyed by others
which shall destroy hys goods and robbe hym
when the sayde significators of goods shall be vnfortunate
the chyld shall be all hys lyfe in payne and trauaile
without any aduauncement or profite
abraham auenesre saith
that if the lord of the second be burnt
and iupiter euill disposed
that the chyld shal be foure planets in their fals or detryments
do shewe great miseries
as it was in the natiuite of iohn duke of saxony
who was taken prisoner of charles the 5
thys good duke had 3
planets in their detryments
and one perigren
alwayes poore
and hermes sayth
when the lord of the profession
of the which we shall speak in the 27
chap
shall be burnt
or retrogard
or in the sixt or xij house
and not any planet regarding the moone
the chyld shall seeke hys lyuing from doore to doore like a begger
iupiter
venus
and the head of the dragon in the second
alwaies enrich
venus in the fift promiseth some good
the sunne in the nynth fortunate
gyueth benefices
or other goods of the side of the men of the church
mars in the sixt well disposed
gyueth good or nourishment to beastes
and exercise of phisicke
the sunne in the signe of leo
will neuer suffer the child to be poore
chap xiiii
by what meanes riches and pouerty commeth
hauing well noted the places which promise and bring riches
in regarding the situation of the said significators
we wyll know by what means ought to come the good and the euill
for if the significator be in the first house receiued and fortunate
it easily inricheth the person by hys industry and proper labour
and if he be in the sayd place vnfortunate
it is that his industry and labour doth profit hym nothing
and the sooner from thence to losse and damage
if he be in the second house well disposed
it profiteth to talke with merchants
and lend merchandize &amp; money
and of them make gaine
and if he be there euil disposed
the sayd busines bringeth great damages
if he be within the thirde house fortunate
it bringeth the goods from the side of brothers and sisters
and cosins &amp; alyes
or from the side of the men of the church in taking charge of theyr affayres
or to traffique heere and there about his country
if he be in the 4
wel placed
he is inriched of inheritances &amp; goods of our fathers &amp; predecessors
of laborings &amp; tilling of ground
of houses
&amp; oftentimes doth meete with treasure
if it be within the fift
it profits to be a good dauncer
a good player
to bee braue
gracious
pleasant and delightfull
and sometimes to be voluptuous
alwayes well
because of god-fathers and god-mothers
and of theyr proper chyldren
or because of gyfts
or to make some voyage and doe some embassage
those things that come appertaining to brauery and volupteousnesse
and making ready delicates
odours &amp; perfumes
of thys house they very suddainly draw theyr profite
if the sayd significator be in the sixt well placed
hee shall make his profite in nourishing
and buying and selling of sheepe
muttons
and other small beastes
or shall become rich by the diligence and faithfulnesse of his seruaunts
or shall gaine by the exercise of phisicke
the gaylors and others which haue the charge of prysons
drawe oftentimes theyr profit from thys house
if the significator be in the seauenth fortunate
it promiseth great good of the side of women
by marriages or like agreements
and oftentimes to haue pleaded &amp; gayned his sute in the law
or hauing beene in the warres and pilled the enemies
if it be in the eyght well disposed
it gyueth great dowrie and great good
because of women
and sometimes heritages
of the which he shall not greatlie thinke of
if it be in the ninth fortunate
hee shal be enriched of the goods of the church
or by traffique &amp; traueling in strange countries
if it be well in the tenth
he shall haue his profit of the side of kings
princes
and lordes
and be made of them gouernours of townes
and honourable officers
or be enriched by their owne vocation and profession
if it be within the eleuenth in good disposition
he profiteth by reason of friendes
and by fauour of men in authoritie
if it be in the twelueth
fortunate
it giueth gayne by nourishing and selling of horses
mares
oxen
kyne
cammells
and other great beastes
or to haue charge of prysonners
or of the persecution of enemies
with profitable victorie in the end
as oftentimes it happeneth to some
which accusing others
and cannot prooue the crymes intended be condemned to make a good amendes to the partie
after all which persecution
the partie doth finde himselfe content
saturne by himselfe
enricheth by heritages &amp; labours
nourishing of all cattell
and with trading with auncient men
or with countrey-men
marriners
&amp; other vilde men
in corne
wines
oyles
fysh
oade
rosen
allum
leather
tyles
stones
plaister
chalke
lyme
and such merchandize
iupiter
by offices
benefices
and busines of men of the church
and all gaynes that are made without deceit
except when he is infortunate
for then vnder the shaddow of vertue
he dooth his affaires craftilie
mars
by warres
sutes
or thefts
or by slaughter
and selling of cattell
or if it be in aspect of venus
by physicke
the sunne
by honourable offices
dignities &amp; lordships
by great credit
by charges to keepe and gather the money of princes and common-weales
venus
by musique
pleasure

and sometimes by voluptuousnes
and somtime to serue some great ladie

a poet
an oratour
and a good aduocate
to be a geometrician
arethmetrician
astrologian
and a good trader
the moone for voyages
nauigation
wandring
and trading in far countries
to haue the chardge of small affaieres of the common wealth
if the said significator be vnfortunat in the same places
they bring dammage and interestes
and if they be within the houses of saturne
iupiter or other planets
wee iudge the profit &amp; interest after the nature of saturne
iupiter
and other planets which shal be lords of the same places
chap xv
of the time when the riches and dammages shall come
the sayde riches shall come
when the significators of goodes shall meete by direction
in body or in aspects of amitie
as if venus in some natiuitie promise goodes
they shall come when venus by direction shall touche the place of iupiter
or the degree of the second house
or the part of fortune
or their good aspects
likewise you must iudge of damages in goodes
for when a significator of damages and interestes doth meete by direction a significator of goods
or his aspects of enmitie
then certainly comes the losse and damage
as when saturne or mars meete iupiter in the parte of fortune
the parte of goodes and other places which signifie riches
the which also you must direct to the sayd ill fortunes
or to their euill aspect sygnifying alwayes some losse
by the reuolutions also you may know the time of good and euill fortune
for when iupiter in the natiuitie shal be in the signe libra well disposed
alwayes and as many times
as you shall find him in the reuolution in the signe
in the same fortune certainlie he shall then bring the goodes that he promised
at the houre of the natiuitie
to the contrarie
if hee be vnfortunate by saturne or mars in the natiuitie
alwayes and as many times as he shall be in the reuolution ouer against the sayd vnfortunators
then the sayd damage shall come in the sort and manner as was signified in the natiuitie
if the significator of goodes be orientall
the goodes come in youth
if it be occidentall
in age
if it be in the first house hee shall be rich in his first age
if it be betweene the first and the tenth
vppon the time of twenty and seuen yeares
if it be in the tenth
betweene thirtye and fiue and thirtie
if it be betweene the tenth and seuenth
about fortie and fortie eight
if it be in the seuenth he shal be rich in his old age
you must also looke to the three lords of the triplicitie
and to euery significator of goodes
for the first lord signifieth the first age
the second of the time of thirtie or fortie yeares
the third the last age
wherefore if the first lord of the triplicitie of one significator of riches be fortunate
the sayd goodes signified shall come at the first time
or if hee be vnfortunate
the damage then shall sticke
by this meanes you may applie the other lordes
to the ages following
and according to the good or euill disposition you must iudge of the fortune of euery one
chap xvi
of bretheren
mars and saturne within the thirde house out of their principall dignities and not receiued
signifieth that the childe shall haue no brother nor sister
and if they be in their principall dignities
or if they be fortunatly receiued
they may then giue some bretheren
but by reason of the which hee shall alwayes be in sorrowe
strife
and contentions
the taile of the dragon or lunaris
maketh him see the death of his bretheren
when shee is in the thirde house
that doth the lord of the sayde house also
when hee is in the tenth or eight
and when he is burned or otherwise euilly disposed
if in the ix
be any plannet well dignified
and the lord of the third house be vnfortunate
his bretheren shall dye before him
if he doo not finde in the same house some fauourable plannet
or if the lord of the saide house be not amiably regarded of fortunes
iupiter
the sunne
venus
the head of the dragon
the moone
and mercury
fortunate in the thirde house
doo giue many bretheren
happy
pacified and fortunate
mars
regarding the said house
or his lord of euill aspect
signifieth strife and debate among the bretheren
that which signifieth also the lord of the said house
in the vij
and xij
and mars opposite to the ascendant
or to the lord of the ascendant
and to the temporall light
and when a like plannet is lord of the iij
and vij
or xij house
the part of the amitie of bretheren with his lord fortunate
signifieth concorde
vnfortunate
discorde among bretheren
the part of bretheren
and the third house
with their lords in watry signes
denoteth many brethren and sisters
and if they be fortunate
they signifie concorde and good loue together
vnfortunate

be in the 11
the childe shall see the death of his father
if the lord of the x
be in the 5
he shall see the death of his mother
venus or the moone in the 4
vnfortunate
giueth perrill to the mother at her deliuerance
the lord of the 4
in the 7 or 12 house
or in euill aspects of ill fortunes
signifieth strife and quarrells betweene the father and the sonne
likewise you must iudge of the mother
when the lord of the 10
shall be in the same disposition
the part of the father fortunate
denoteth long and happy life to the father
vnfortunate
he shall dye very quickly
the part of the mother
signifieth as much of the mother
after her good or euill disposition
commonly the astrologians haue regard to the sunne and to saturne for the father
and to venus and the moone for the mother
if the natiuitie bee by day
they take the sun for significator of the father
if it by be night they take saturne
if the sunne be not in any angle of heauen
for if it be in the 1
or 4
they preferre him alwayes to saturne
if the sunne be in the 1
in the natiuitie of the 1 childe
the figure of the natiuitie of the father and of the sonne shall be both one
the significator of the father
ioyned to the fortunes
or receiuing their amiable aspects
denote good fortune and long life to the father
the contrary you must vnderstand when they be vnfortunate
if the lorde of the ascendant
and the lorde of the 4
doo looke with an euill aspect
the sonne and the father shall be in discorde
principally if mars intermeddle with his pernicious beames
for the mother you must looke principally to venus
if the natiuitie be by day
or to the moone if it be by night
and after their good and euill dispositions
you must iudge the good or contrary fortune of the mother

that also signifieth the significators of ryches
when they bee well disposed within the houses of saturne
and the part of heritages
and the part of fortune in sowers &amp; tyllers when they be fortunate
with their lords
if the sayde significator be vnfortunate
you must iudge the contrary
when one selfe plannet is lorde of the first and fourth house
the childe shall haue inheritances which shall enrich him
if the sayd lorde be fortunate
and if he sell and dispearse them
he is vnfortunate
the lorde of the ascendant
or the moone within the fourth fortunate
and amiably by iupiter or venus regarded
denote that he shal finde some great summe of money vnder the earth
principally
if saturne cast his trynes or sextil beames
or that of mines of golde and siluer he shall be made rich
the tayle of the dragon in the south
maketh him to sell &amp; dispearse his goods
that doth also the head of the dragon

of diseases
yov must first of all consider the places of saturne and of mars
and of the lord of the sixt house
and according to the signe in the which they bee
you must iudge the sicknesse to bee in the place marked by the sayd signe
as if saturne were in the signe of libra
it denoteth that the sicknes is in the reynes of the nature of saturne
because that libra is the signe that hath gouernment ouer the reynes
as shall be declared in the seconde booke
likewise you must iudge of other significators

mars in the ascendant

to the contrary
if the degrees of the first house
or the lumynaries be ioyned with any troublesome starre
the eyes shall be darke

if then in the eyght there bee any fortunate planet
or any part fortunate
the chyld shall haue great dowrie by his wife
and of that side shall meet with great inheritaunces &amp; great goods

chap xxiiii
of the death
yov must first consider if there bee any planet in the eyght house
for it is conuenient to take it for significator of the death
if within the sayde house there be neuer a planet
take them for significators that be in the seauenth
preferring him alwaies that is best dignifyed
if within the seauenth you finde none
drawe the sgnifycator of the death from these places which followe

of the eyght signe
from the moone and of his lord
of the place of the first lorde of the triplicitie of the fourth angle
of the place of the planet which hath dignity of terme
to the degree of the seauenth house
the planet which in all these places shall be most dignifyed
shall be principall sgnificator of death
if saturne beeing in the eyght or seauenth house
or otherwise more dignified in the aboue saide poynts of the figure
he is principall significator of the death
if hee be well disposed
it witnesseth
that the same partie shall dye of the dropsy
of some great stopping of the lyuer
and of the spleene
or of a quarterne feuer
of the flixe of the belly
of pthisick
or of some burning feuer
and of impostumations of the eares
&amp; c
if it be greatly vnfortunate
and together with the lord of the ascendant
and the luminaries temporally be euill disposed
it denoteth violent death by impostumes
palsies
falling downe of humors
suffocations
ouer-flowen with water
when it is in watry signes
by some fall or ruine
when it is in earthlie signes
by great blowes
for to be hanged when it is in ayerie signes
if iupiter be significator of the death
it denoteth that he shall die of a pluresie
of a squinance
or of some hote appostumations of the lyuer
or of the lunges
or of other sicknesses comming of wind or of blood
and that if he be fortunate
for when he is euill disposed and vnfortunate
it maketh hym die by the hand of iustice
by the commandement of the prince
by sentence of the iudge or of the marshall
by ouer-flowing in waters
to be whypped and scourged
by long imprisonment
if it be mars well disposed
by continuall tertian feuers
by flixe of blood
by carbuncles and pestilences
by impostumes comming of chollerick matters
burnings by too much vsing of women
if he be very euil disposed
it maketh him to be hanged and strangled
or smothered
or otherwise killed in his bedde
or on hys horse
when he is an ayrie signe or partaker within the water
when he is a watry signe or fallen from on high
or of some ruinous murtherer
when he is a terrestiall
or burned
when he is a fierie signe
principally if the lord of the ascendant and the luminaries temporally be vnfortunate by mars
if it be the sunne well disposed
hee shall die of some hote disease

or of some fistula or impostume
if she be vnfortunate
it denoteth death by venim
principallie when she is burned
or ioyned to saturne

with breaking in sunder the veynes
by foolish mellancholie
by ielousie
if it be the moone well disposed
with too much eating moyst meates
by drinking water
by too much continuing his pleasure
if she be vnfortunate
you must consider the nature of him which is vnfortunate
for if it be mars hee shall dye by fire
or by hurt
or by abortisment if it be a woman
if it bee saturne
by ruines
falles
pestilences
and like accidents
before concluding of what death the partie shall dye
you must consider the disposition of the lorde of the ascendant
and of the luminaries temporall
for if they be well disposed
the death shal not be vyolent
although the principall significator bee greatly vnfortunate
if the sayd significator be vnfortunate
together with the luminaries temporall
or the lord of the ascendant euill disposed
we esteeme certainly that the death shall be vyolent
if iupiter or venus doo not intermingle theyr fauourable beames
and then the sayd person shall fall in great daunger of the said violent death
&amp; from the which he shall alwayes escape myraculously
if one of the ill fortunes be in the signe of cancer
and the other in the signe of the lyon
the death shall be vyolent
likewise
if any of the sayde ill fortunes be in the signe of the lyon
and the luminaries temporall
or the lord of the ascendant be vnfortunate
and one of the ill fortunes be in the first house
and the other in the seuenth or fourth
or one of them in the tenth and the other in the fourth
the sunne
or the moone
or the lord of the ascendant

which the astrologers cal the head of meduse
or otherwise the head of the diuel

angles of heauen
or at the least 3
the personne shall dye a horrible death
for he shall leese his head
or be cut in foure quarters
or be drawen with foure horses
principally
if in the sayde angles be the signes of gemini
pisces and aquarius
mars in the ninth or eyght in the signe of aquarius or of gemini
opposite to the moone
or the lorde of the ascendant
without good aspect of fortunes

or fourth house vnfortunate
the lord of the sayde houses maketh hym dye in pryson
or els where in great payne and trauaile

or the lord of the ascendant be vnfortunate in any of the sayd houses
the tayle of the dragon beeing ioyned to the significators of death
denote poysons
venims
and violent medicines
or ill applyed
and flixe of the belly
mars within the fourth
eyght
twelfth
or sixt vnfortunate
theyr lords and the luminaries temporall
or the lorde of the ascendant
witnesse violent death
by the shedding of blood or otherwise
the significators of death within the ninth or thyrd house
signifie that the person shall die by the way
or in a strange country
except they be in theyr owne proper houses or exaltations
for then he shall die in his house
&amp; bring his euill from the high waies
the said significators in their proper houses or exaltations
make him die in his house
if they be peregrines
they make him dye out of his house
the moone ioyned to a fixed starre
named the claire of the ballance meridionall
denoteth violent death
that dooth she also when she is ioyned with other starres that haue the nature of the luminaries
mars in the viij
house with the head of the dragon
maketh him to bee hanged and strangled
many planets within the seauenth house
make him dye of some strange and terrible kind of death
saturne
mars
and the heade of the dragon in the first
venus and mercurie with the taile in the seauenth
make the body in a thousand peeces
if the principall significator bee burned in his owne proper house or exaltation
without being otherwise vnfortunate
it maketh him dye suddainly of some feeblenes
or other suddaine and secrete accident
without other violence
the fortunes well disposed in the eyght house
preserue him alwaies from violent death
chap xxv
of voyages by land and by sea
ivpiter
venus
the sunne and mercurie fortunate in the ninth house
denote that he shall be happy in viages by land and by sea
saturne and mars signifie to the contrary
and principally saturne doth hinder the viages by water
and mars the waies by lande
if within the ninth house there be neuer a planet
you must consider the moone
and the lord of the ninth
and the parts of the waies and viages by land and by water
with their lordes
the which fortunate
giueth profitable nauigations
vnfortunate
denote the contrary
likewise you must iudge of the third house and of his lord
when they be well or euill disposed
the head of the dragon in the ninth
fauoureth greatlie to the fortune of viages
and the tayle to the contrary
chap

of the constancie in his religion
also as the head of the dragon
the luminaries
and mercurie in the ninth house well disposed
denote entire fayth and constancie in hys religion
saturne
mars
and the tayle of the dragon do hynder it
saturne of his nature is most enclined to the law of the iewes
and mars to the law of the turkes &amp; mahometists
the tayle of the dragon
causeth him alwaies to erre from the truth of the law
the lord of the nynth
and the part of the fayth
with hys dominator fortunate
yeeldeth a man constant in his faith
vnfortunate maketh him variable
if the part of the spirite be in the signe of the lyon at the byrth of a christian
hee shall be very constant in hys religion
if the sunne be fortunate
if he be vnfortunate by saturne
to goe from his fayth
and to addresse it to that of the iewes
if he be vnfortunate by mars
it maketh him more to encline to the lawe of the turkes and mahometists
if the said part be in the houses of saturne at the natiuitie of a iewe
or in the houses of mars at the natiuitie of a turke
they shall denie theyr lawe
if the sayd lords of the sayd part be retrogrades
or otherwise ill disposed
saturne in the nynth at the natiuitie of a iewe
doth nothing diminish his faith
saturne in the said house when he is fortunate
signifieth dreames to be true
mars and the tayle of the dragon signifie them vaine and false
the other significators doe aslure them to be true
chap xxvii
of the action and profession
how to knowe of what profession the childe shall be
you must chiefely consider if any planet be in the tenth house

if there be many significators
or if the principall bee coupled with many planets
you must mingle the significations of the one and of the other
and of the said mixture
gather together the profession comming of the concurrence of the starres
you must also consider in what house the sayde significators be
if they be within the second
the profession shall be of feates of merchandize and traffiques
if within the third or ninth
of feates of religion
or gathering the goods of the church
if in angles
of dominations &amp; gouernments

shall be significator of the sayd considerations in good or euill
according to his good or euill disposition
particulerly also you must follow the sayde places one after another to know of what side principally the sayde dignities

mars in the sayde places in natiuities by night
signifieth also great aduauncement
&amp; by day more then saturne
the part of gouernment and his lorde within any of the angles
witnes great fauour of kings
likewise you must iudge of the other part that we haue deducted vpon the tenth house

iupiter for hys vertue
the sunne and the head of the dragon in the same house

that which iupiter dooth also when hee receiueth the vertue of all the other planets
&amp; communicateth hys owne to saturne and the sunne
and the fortunes and the luminaries when they be in the angles of heauen
manie planets in the fourth house
denoteth great honour after death
if in the poynts of the angles be any fixed starre of the first or second greatnes
or other hauing the nature of lumynaries
it is a great signe of incredible aduancement
that which happeneth also when the sayd starres be ioyned to the lumynaries temporall
or to the parte of fortune
or to his lord
or to the planets and parts that bee in the angles
they which haue saturne in the tenth burnt
or the lord of the tenth burnt
or be by saturne oppressed
or that haue the tayle of the dragon in the tenth
receiue commonly some forme of dishonour
and often be depriued of theyr estate
when the fortunes doe not intermingle theyr fauourable beames
except when they be also vnfortunate in theyr proper houses or exaltations
or in the signes of aries and the lyon
you must note that saturne &amp; mars
hinder greatly the good fortunes
vntil that the man hath passed the number of yeres corrispondent to the number of the smal yeres of the said planets
and if they hinder any more time
it shal bee vntill that the man shall accomplish the number of yeeres aunswering to the number of degrees

persecution by reason of his profession

and shall haue great mischiefe for his friendes
in the twelfth
many enuies and enemies that shall imagine many mischiefes against him
likewise
you must iudge of all the partes of the xii
houses
as the part of fortune in the first signifieth
that he shal be rich and fortunate by his industrie
in the second
that he shal be come rich in all that is signified by the second house

all these bee the foundations and rootes of the iudgements astronomical

of directions
the art of directions so dilygently entreated vpon by john de regiomount
that their is no more place fitly to speake of the same
except that with the ayde of god we haue purposed to translate into french his problemes and documents appertayning to the sayde matter
neuerthelesse we will here touch the the principall poynte
to direct
which tearme i vse being being most commonly vsed and of long time receyued
although it bee not proper
it is no other thing then to stay the meeting of one place of the heauens with another consequently following
acording to the naturall order of the signes
&amp; that the mouing of the first mobile
the first place is named the significator
the seconde the promittor
as if the ascendant were in the xx
degree of sagittarius &amp; saturne in thex of capricorne
one might direct the ascendant to saturne &amp; the ascendant shall bee significator of life
&amp; saturne promittor of death or sicknes
&amp; then the iudgement shal be danger of death
there is another form of direction attributed to the parts &amp; planets retrogrades
which do make following the naturall course of their mobile
to the contrary of the consequence of the signes
of the which the craft is like to the 1
&amp; there is no difference but that wee haue called significator
which is here promittor
and the promittor is heere significator
the poynt meridionall of the tenth house
you must direct by the right ascentions
the poynt of the ascendant
by the ascentions obliques
founde in the table of the latitude of your region
the poynts and starres that shall be betweene the merydian and the horrizon
by the oblique ascentions vnder the circle in the which they be
the which you call
the cyrcle of position
the which for to finde
and likewise to haue the ascentions of euery place hauing latitude or no
you must follow the methode following
first
you must take the longitudes of plannets
fixed starres
and other places that you would direct
that is to say
the signe
degree
and mynute that they ● olde in the zodiack and in the ephemerides
or other tables astronomicall
&amp; c
secondly
you must calculate their latitudes
in degrees and mynutes placed in the ephemerides
thirdly
theyr declination by the first probleame of the booke of directions of regiomont
then
theyr right ascentions by the third probleame of the sayde house
then againe
the distances of the circle meridional by the nineteenth probleame
incontinent
the circles of their positions
by the twentith probleame
consequently the dyfferences ascentional by the table expressed
and finally the oblique ascentions by the tenth canon
if the sayd starres be betweene the poynt meridionall of the tenth house
and the poynt of the fourth
or the discentions of obliques by the eleuenth probleame
if they be betweene the poynt of the fourth and the tenth
thys done
take out the number of the oblique ascentions of the significator
of the number of the oblique ascentions of the promittor
take to the table of the position of the significator
or the contrary
if you direct the parts and planets retrogrades
that which resteth of degrees &amp; minutes
turne into yeres
monthes &amp; dayes
and by this meanes
you shall haue exactly the time of good or euill that shall happen vnto you by direction
intending that one degree is heere signified a yeere
fiue mynutes a month
one minute 6
dayes &amp; some od howers
he that would helpe the seconds hee shall touch the ende more perfectly
for to know the sicknesses and daunger of death
you must direct the fiue vital places that we haue considered
searching the gyuer of lyfe
in fixed starres of violent nature in the poynt of the fourth
sixt
seauenth and eyght
and the tayle of the dragon
to the ill fortunes and theyr euill aspects in the partes of death
and by and by to the sunne
and to the head of the dragon
likewise for the same consideration
you must direct the saide pernicious places to the fiue vitall places
and they meeting
they iudge that the man is in great danger of death
when the fortunes doe not shewe foorth theyr fauourable beames
for the goods
honour
dignities
friendships
and other considerations
you must direct the one significator of goods with the other
and the one significator of honour with the others
of the which wee haue made mention in the first booke
following the particuler iudgements of the natiuities
chap 2
of the seperator or burner
called of the arabians
algebuthar
the seperator or burner
is the planet which hath dignitie of tearme &amp; degree
to the which the yeere is aunswerable
mutiplied with the ascentions of one significator
for to finde the seperator of the like
you must take the oblique ascentions of the ascendant
and adde vnto the same the yeeres of your age
and search it all in the table of the latitude of your region
to looke to which signe and degree the saide number aunswereth
for vnto that poynt shall come the perfection of your life
looke afterwarde which is the plannet which hath dignitie of tearme in the said degree
for of the selfe same shall be the seperator of the life
by the same meanes you may seeke the seperators of the honour
goods
gaynes
friendes
and of other lyke
vpon the circles of theyr positions
the which is conuenient to seeke following the afore-said methode of directions
chap
iii
of the lords of the triplicities
yov must also note all the lordes of the triplicities
in places which signifie good and euill
as well in significations of lyfe
as of goods
friendes
honor
marriages
pylgrimages &amp; c
if they be wel disposed in the reuolution
they shall signifie well
touching the signification of the place of the which they be lordes
if they be vnfortunate
they signifie euill
that is to vnderstand
the lords of the tryplicities of vitall places
wil signifie of the life
of the places of fortune
riches &amp; profit
of places of honour
of the honour
good or euill
according as they be fortunate or vnfortunate at the hower
of the reuolution
chap iiii
of reuolutions
the sunne returning to the same poynt in the which he was at the hower of the natiuity
maketh the reuolution euery yeere
he therfore that wold know the hower and mynute of the reuolution
he must looke in the ephemerides
at what hower and mynute the sunne beganne to enter into the degree minute and second
in which he was at the hower of the natiuity
if the ephemerides doe not suffise you for thys matter
goe to a table made for the same purpose
by peter pitat
in the beginning of the same ephemerides
by him corrected and augmented
jerom cardin vseth another
which i finde very exact
the which hee hath written in his booke
of the restitution of times and celestiall motions
in the fyft chapter
chap v
of the iudgements vpon the reuolutions
first looke howe the seperator of lyfe is disposed in the figure of the reuolution
for if hee be vnfortunate
he denoteth sicknes and other daungerous accidents
if he be fortunate
he holdeth him healthfull and glad all the yeere
so likewise you must iudge of the seperator of goods
friends
dignities &amp; other effects
it is to vnderstand
that they giue good fortune in the said significations
if they be well disposed
or els losse &amp; euill fortune if they be vnfortunate
in the second place
looke if the lords of the tryplicities of the vitall places be well disposed
and of places which signifie riches
honour
trauailes
bretheren
parents
wiues and children
doe so much
for in the same significations the man shall be happy or vnhappy
according as the sayd lords shall be wel or euil disposed
and principally you must consider the lord that shall raigne ouer your age
for the first lord of one tryplicity gouerneth the first age
the second
the middest of the life
the third
the latter yeere
thirdly
you must consider which is the planet which gouerneth ouer the yeere of your age
that which the arabians call fridate
fourthly
the lorde of the signe in which shall come the same yeere of perfection
in the fift place
the lord of the circulation
accounting by the lord of the houre of the natiuity
then the lord of the circulation
accounting by the lord of the ascendant of the natiuitie
and if in the ascendant of the natiuitie there be anie planet
you must likewise make circulation
furthermore
you must looke if any planet returne to the same signe and house
in the which it was at the natiuitie
for then it intendeth the same effect which it hath signifyed in the natiuity
principally when it returneth to the same signe
you must also haue regard to the aspects which are made in the reuolution
if they be like to them of the natiuity
for that shal be a renuing of the effects of the said aspects
and you must not forget the chaunging of the places
for if a happy plannet bee in the reuolution in the place where an euill planet was in the natiuity
the euill signified by the sayd euill planet in the natiuitie
shall be deferred that yeere by the presence of the happy planet
to the contrary
if a planet promise any good fortune in the natiuitie
and in hys place in the reuolution be any vnfortunate planet
the same good signifyed in the natiuitie
shal be diminished in the reuolution
or lost by reason of the said ill fortune
the mis-fortune in the places of mis-fortune augmenteth the euill
the good fortunes in the places of good fortune
augmenteth the good fortune
for to iudge of the said considerations
you must haue recourse to that which we haue sayde in the two former bookes of generall and particuler significations of the houses
signes
planets
aspects
&amp; particuler situations of the planets in signes and houses
hauing alwaies before your eyes
the disposition of starres in the figure of the natiuitie
for if a planet be in the natiuity greatly vnfortunate
and in the reuolution well disposed
it cannot much profite because of the first infelicity
likewise you must iudge of those which bee fortunate in natiuities
which being vnfortunate in reuolucions
do no great damage
there be some that contemplate herevpon
many other things
the which by experience i haue often found vnprofitable
false
and superfluous

then the moone

saturne eleuen yeeres

the head of the dragon
and the tayle
the numbers by order as we haue sayd before
many by great curiositie
haue added to this companie other planets to euery gouernment

for experience hath often taught mee and other very expert in this science
that this subtiltie is too curious
vaine and superfluous

vii
of profections
for the profections you must resolue the twelue houses of your natiuity in equall partes vppon the eclipse
so farre as the ascendant is in the first degree of any signe
the seconde house shall be in the fyrst degree of a signe following
and the thirde
in the first degree of a thirde signe
and to conclude
that euery house beginne by the fyrst degree
as the first house
also
euery house will containe thirtie degrees
&amp; the first thirty degrees of the first house
shall appertaine to the fyrst yeere wherein the infant is borne
the thirtie of the second
to the second yeere
the thirty of the thirde to the third yeere
&amp; so consequently vntill twelue
twelue yeeres passed
you must begin againe at the first
and then come to the second
third
fourth &amp; c
and so from twelue to twelue you must renue the same circuite
if you finde the reuolution within the thirtie degrees seruing to your yeere
it signifieth some good or euil
according to his nature or good or euill disposition
&amp; signification of the place
of which shall be the sayd profection
that is to say
of the places of lyfe
sicknes
death
or good health
of the places of goods
riches
losse
or pouertie
&amp; c
commonly they seeke the profection of fyue places of one natiuitie
that is to say
of the place of the sunne for honour
of the place of the moone for the qualities of the spyrit
towardes the body and externall goods
of the place of the parte of fortune
for gaine and profite
of the tenth house for the actions
of the ascendant for the lyfe
if the sunne be gyuer of lyfe
it must be considered as gyuer of lyfe and giuer of honor likewise
the which you must doe also in other places
when they import manie significations
if then you finde any plannet within the thirtie degrees of your profection
and would know what moneth or day the accident by him signifyed shal happen
looke what distance you haue betweene the first point of your profection
and the said plannet
if there be xv
degrees betweene them
the saide accident shall happen out in the ende of sixe moneths
if there be twentie-fiue degrees
at the end of tenne monethes
for heere two degrees and a halfe
value one moneth
one degree valueth twelue dayes and foure houers
thirty minutes value sixe daies
fiue minutes one day
of this there is a verie exact table among the documents of peter pytat vpon the ephemerides
example of the profections
suppose that the ascendant of a natiuitie was the fifteene degree of scorpius
i would know where the profection shall light of the ascendant at the ende of tenne yeeres after the childborne
i account tenne signes from the ascendant
after that
i finde the fifteene degree of virgo seruing after tenne yeeres
accomplished to xj
current
i say then that in the said time
the profection of the ascendant is come in the fifteene degree of virgo
&amp; shall end that yeere in the fifteene degree of libra
and also shal containe thirty whole degrees
within the which if any planet be founde
it shall signifie good or euill of the life
according to the nature &amp; disposition as if in the said time
mars beeing to the fift degree of libra
i woulde say that the infant should be troubled that yeere at the end of eyght moneths
because that mars was in the place profectionall of life
distant from the first poynt twentie dedrees
we haue shewed before that two degrees and a halfe value one month
fiue degrees two monthes
and fifteene degrees sixe monthes
and by course twenty degrees eyght monethes
you must note
that the profections ought to fitte to the yeeres currant or complete
it is to be vnderstoode the tenth signe
as for incontinent after nine yeeres complete
which is tenne yeeres currant
&amp; c
chap
viii
the lords of the circulations from the howers of the natiuities
the babilonians hold for a great secrete
the circulation of the lord of the hower of the natiuitie
it is to be vnderstood
that the lord of the said houre signifieth of the life as the ascendant
and the lord of the hower following
of goods as of the second house
and the lord of the third hower of bretheren as the third house
and so consequently of others
in reuolutions
they giue the lorde of the hower of the natiuitie to the first yeere
the plannet following to the second
and so consequently following the natural order of the planets
as if one were borne in the hower of venus
that planet should raigne the first yeere
the second yeere
mercurie
the third
the moone
the fourth
saturne
the fift
iupiter
the sixt
mars
the seauenth sol
the eyght
venus
the ninth
mercurie
and so by order
and you must note
that wee take heere the yeeres currant
and not complete
for to fit the sayde circulation of the planets
chap
ix
of the circulation of the lord of the ascendant
and the planets which are in the ascendant
the circulation of the lord of the ascendant
and the planets and parts which be in the ascendant
they be euen as we haue saide of the lorde of the houre of the natiuitie
and by the same order you must place them
the yeeres of the age of the chyld
by iudgement
we haue made mention and proofe of reuolutions
chap
x
of eclipses and great coniunctions appertaining to reuolutions of natiuities
the eclipse of the sunne
and the coniunctions of the superiour planets
causeth commonly many euils
after the congruence of the starres
and nature of the signes and plannets raigning in the saide places
to men causeth sicknesses
when they be within the fiue next degrees of the ascendant
or to the gyuer of lyfe
if they touch the other parts
plannets or houses
they pronounce euill fortune
appertaining to the significations of the same places
principally
if in the same time of the natiuitie
any such constellations were in force
if they touch the places perfectionals
they doe almost the same effect as in natiuities
chap
xi
of the particuler meetings of the whole yeere
concerning the particuler meetings of all the yere
and manie others
doe rest harde vppon the profections
mensturnes and diurnes
of the which you haue a perfect table in the booke of directions of john de regiomonte
hauing more subtiltie &amp; curiousnes then trueth
as i haue often found by experience
it aunswereth better my opinion schonor
which euerie day considered
if any planet touch the places of the planets
parts &amp; houses
of the natiuitie or their good or euill aspect
that i doe apply to the places profectionall
as for example
let the ascendant of a natiuitie
or the place of his profection bee the twelfe degree of libra
the sunne in the fifteenth of gemini
mars in the fifteenth of leo
alwaies
and as often as the sunne or the moone doe passe ouer the xv
degree of leo
the man shall bee mooued by angry accidents
as of displeasure
of some alteration
payne of the head
feauer
hote impostumes
tetters
&amp; c
likewise when it toucheth the fyft degree of scorpius
or of taurus
there where the quadrate aspects be within the place of mars
or the fift of aquarius
which is the place opposite to mars
if any planet touch the fift degree of libra
or of gemini
there where the sextile aspects be
or the fift of sagitarius and of aries
which make the tryne aspects of the saide mars
it shall signifie some fauourable meetings of captaines and men of warre
if the ill fortunes touch not the saide twelfe degree of libra
as we haue said in the ascendant
that shal be signe of some euill meeting
as well to life as to the body
likewise you must iudge of other attouchments
according to the nature of the aspects
by vs explained in the seconde booke
you must contemplate the places profectionals
for i doe apply euerie degree and minute to the dayes in the which their signification fall
and regard the good &amp; euill aspects of the planets euery day
if they touch the degree profectionall
as for example
of the said natiuitie in the which was the ascendant libra
suppose that the profection was come to the twelfe degree of cancer
in the ninth yeere complete and the tenth currant
the thirteenth degree of cancer
serueth to the twelfe day after the proper day of the reuolution
wherefore i consider then the aspects of the planets towards the saide thirteenth degree
likewise so i do of other degrees and minutes
fitted to those daies in the which they gouerne
and so much for reuolutions

a letter sent from sarient maior forbes from the king of swethens army to his reverend father mr iohn forbes
minister to the worshipful company of marchant adventurers residing in delft
touching the great battle fought by lypsick betweene the king of swethen
the duke of saxons army
and the emperours army
and that commanded by generall tilly
of the catholique league the 7 of september 1631
honored and loving father upon the fourth of this month of september
it pleased god that the kings army &amp; the duke of saxons joyned together
neere unto a towne called dieben and marched forward towards lypsick
which generall tilly had taken in and laye with his army about halfe a mile from it
where he mett us with his army
and tooke up the best advantage of ground for his men
and planted his ordinance upon the places
which he thought fittest
the kings armie marched on the right hand of the battle
and the dukes on the left
and so advanced in battleray against out ennemy
who begann to playe despitfully with his ordinance upon us
which wee cared not much for
but advanced forward with our ordidinance likewise playing before us
they seing us marching towards them
they advanced likewise towards us
and came so close one to an other
that joyning battalions together
wee came to pushe of the pike
and disputed the buysinesse so longe
till it pleased god that wee routed them and gaue us the victorie
by putting the ennemy to a retreate with the kings owne army
but the dukes army was vily beaten back
and begann to make a shameful flight
so that wee were forced to send our horse men after these that were beaten
and to relieve the dukes men with our foote
which doing wee putt all the ennemy at last to flight
and followed the execution very hotely till it was darke night
&amp; till wee could not see to persue them any further
for which victorie immortal thankes be given to god
the ennemy was at least 40000 allfighting men and our army
and the dukes cold make not aboue 36000 men horse and foote
the next day there was found dead on both sides slayne upon the place of battle 10000 bodies
whereof the most of them were the ennemies
besides these that were slayne upon their flight &amp; execution which were connted to be as great a number
there were taken in all about 8000 prisonners
the most of them having taken entertaynment of the king
and marches with our army
there were diverse collonells of note slayne on both sides
generall tilly was shott and hurt three times
the lord marshall schoonburck slayne
and fiue other collonells
the duke of holsteyne taken prisonner
who afterward dyed of his wounds
besides divers other lieutenants collonels
captaynes and officers
which would be too long to relate
of our side there were slayne collonell divel
collonele hall
colonele cullenburck
and lieutenant colonele adercus
colonele turnill hurt
and my colonele hurt
besides diverse captaynes
lieutenants &amp; ensignes
wee haue taken two and twentie peeces of canon
whereof there are seven which were the king of bohemias
lost at the battle of prage
besides great store of powder
bullets
match
and munition of warre
52 coullours of foote and 37
cornetts of horse this is the truth of the great victorie which god hath given us which you maye report for a certaine
for i write noe more unto you but that which i saw with my owne eyes
i wold haue written to diverse others
but i praye yow lett this letter suffice for all
and when any other occasion shall offer yt selfe
yow shall heare further from mee
noe more at this time
but my dutie remembred to your felfe my mother
and my loue to my bretheren and sisters
and al other my freinds
i commit you to the protection of him that hath given us this glorious victorie and rest
your loving sonne
from the kings army at hall the tenth of september 1631 the rest of the kings proceeding in the countries and towns which he hath taken in since that battle as they followe in time
i take it this generation doe live in that age this prophecy shal be fulfilled revelation
o heavens rejoyce of hir
and ye holy apostles and prophets
for god hath given your judgment on hir for your sakes
here the holy-ghost doth describe the joy and rejoycing of all the faithfull for the destruction of the romish superstition
and hunane inventions
by heaven here is meant
the faithfull professours of the truth
because they belong to heaven
and have their meditations in heaven
by apostels and prophets are not meant those famous preachers which lived in former ages
but are to be taken for those faithfull teachers which witnes gods truth on earth in his millitant church
as for our matters on earth they belong not to those blessed soules which are and have been resting so long blessedly in heaven
for dead men
saith the scripture
know nothing anie more here
and therfore saith the prophet
that abraham is ignorant of us
and that israel knows us not isay
therefore this is the rejoycing of all gods people at the abolishing of all humane inventions in gods worship
and they rejoyce at the advancing of all the institutions of christ
that he may raigne as king in his church by his own laws and ordinaunces as the apostle testifyeth 1
and this he is commanded to observe till the appearing of iesus christ to judgment the 6
therefore not in the liberty of earthly potentates to alter
for christ shall raign

i meane mens inuentions &amp; carnall interpretations which the fayth in chryste neuer begate
then saint paule gaue to peter his college when he leafte the table of the gentils &amp; went to the iewes
which facte of peter in my iudgement
paule mought more conueniently haue aproued seynge peter dyd it to the entent he wolde not offend his weake bretherns the iewes with his eatinge
then the trewe and syncere ministers of christ in the gospel may wincke at manye thinges vsed in this dayes amonge the disciples of the gospell
moch lesse maye they approue than with the fashion of there owne liuing
&amp; confirme them with the auctorite of a counsel &amp; with preachinge they saye it is not tyme to speake agaynst them
be it yet is it tyme to leaue them &amp; no lenger to seame to alowe them
onles they entend alwayes to walke in them had the auctor of this boke loked after a tyme as some doo he had not wryten against purgatorye
when he dyd i feare me some mayntaine blyndnes more with there symulacyon then they open the lyght with there preachinge
but this haue i spoken good reader besydes my purpose which was non other then to admonysh the that althought rochester
more &amp; rastell haue all thre
as thou perceyuest by readinge this former treatise
stiffely defended one
yet shuldest thou not haue of all thre one iudgement or opinion
more and rochestre were men of high dignite in this worlde
the one a byshope
the other chaunceler of this noble realme of englond
both auncyent in yeres of so great wytte &amp; so synguler erudition in all kynde of lerninge estemed aswell of them selfes as of many other
that no ii lyke myght in all this londe be founde
it was thought that for there dignite noman durste for there yeres wytte &amp; lernyng noman was able to agayne say them
wherfore they were persuaded to be the mooste meate of all other to take in hande the defence of the terrible paynes of purgatorye eyther the verye foundacion
or els the cheffe buyldynge sette vppon the foundacion of the church of rome rastell had nothynge commen with them
but only many yeres &amp; awyt sophisticall whych he called naturall reason
as a ꝑtaininge to goddes worde he aknowleged hymselfe ignoraunt therof notwithstondinge had such opinion of his wyt that he thought he coulde as well proue purgatory by it as the other ii
hadde done by the scryptures wherin i thynke he was not deceaued and as this iii persons were not like so toke they the answere made to them not a lyke
more &amp; rochestre thought foule scorne
see what the glorye of this worlde &amp; hygh estimacion of our selfes doth
that a ionge man of smale reputacion shulde take vppon him so cleane contrarye to their opinion to wrytte agaynst them
and to be shorte toke the matter so greuouslye
that they could neuer after be quyet in their stomakes vntyll they had dronken his bloud rastell though he perceyued his natural reason to be sore sayd to
yet was he not malicious as the other were and therfore wrote he agayne
which worke of rastell came to his handes when he was presonner in the tower of london
where he made the answer folowyng to the same which answere after rastell had reade
he was well content to counte his natural reason folyshnes and with harty thankes geuen to god becam a chylde agayne
and sucked of the wysdome which cometh from aboue &amp; saueth all that be noryshed therwith
in the which he contynued to his lyfes ende with the honour and glorye of god to whome be prase for euer
amen
here foloweth te preface of this boke
brother rastell i thanke yow that it had pleased you to be so fauourable vnto me a pore presoner
as to shewe me a copie of your boke which yow haue wryten to confute my reasons &amp; scrypture that i haue alleged against purgatory
for that hath caused me to make a subsydy defence &amp; bulwarke to my boke which by goddes grace shal be an occation to open more lyght
although not to yow
yet at the lestwyse vnto them whose hartes the prince of this world hathe
4 blynded but that the lyghte of the gospell and glorye of chryste maye shyne in them and where as yow wryte &amp; proteste that yow wyll brenge no scripture agaynst me
but only rehersse my scrypture againe whiche i haue alleged vnꝑfeytlye and wounde me with myne owne dartes
&amp; wyll but euen do as one that playeth at tennes wyth another tossinge the balle agayne
i doo verye well admitte your similitude
not withstodinge yow know ryght wel that it is not i noughe for a man playinge at tennes to tosse the ball agayn
but he must so tosse it that the tother take it not
for yf the other smyte it ouer agayne then is the game in as great ieoberdy as it was before besydes
that he muste take hede that he neyther smyte to shorte of the lynne nor yet vnder
for then it is a losse and he had ben better to let it go
and yet an vngracious poste stondeth in the waye &amp; maketh the ball to rebounde backe agayne ouer the corde &amp; loseth the game
and that wyl anger a man
&amp; i assartayne yow that ye haue tossed neuer a ball but ye offende in one of this poyntes
&amp; yet besydes that somtyme ye playe a touche of legerdemayne &amp; caste me a ball which when it commythe i perceaue to be non of myne
&amp; all the courte shall iudge the same
this poyntes shal be declared when we come to them
and nowe i wyll answer in order
an answere to rastels fyrst prologe
in youre prologe yow assigned
rastell ii causes of the makyng of youre i
boke of purgatory without alleginge any textes of scripture for the proue therof which are the controuersye of ii sortes of people
one sorte you say be those that beleue not in christ
but yet they wyll construe exponde and interprete this textes after theyr owue wylles and obstinate mynde
now let vs consyder your forsayd causes &amp; ponder whether your boke haue or may do any such good as you say pretended
&amp; whether it haue conuerted those sortes of people
or els by any thynge likely to do suche a facte
and fyrst let vs se what it profyteth the fyrste sorte which are infideles not beleuinge in chryst nor his scripture
ihon
our sauiour christ saieth
he that beleueth is not dampned
confirmeth the same saying
he that beleueth in the sonne hath euerlastinge lyffe
but he that beleueth not in the sone ̄ shall not se lyfe
but the wrath of god abydeth vppon him
here it is euident not be my exposicyon
but by the consent of all christen men
that those in fideles are dampned
for what entent than shulde rastel teache them that there is a purgatory
without christ their is no way but dampnacy on as scripture &amp; all faythfull men testifye
then wolde i know by what way he wolde perswade that there were a purgatory
which shulde be away &amp; ameane to saluacion and not to dampnacion
for them which beleue not in chryst
this i am sure of
&amp; i thinke rastell beleueth it also
that the infydeles shall neuer come in it thoughe theire were one
this you maye se that his fyrst cause is verye vayne
&amp; that yf they dyd beleue it they were in dead deceyued
now let vs procede vnto the seconde sorte of poeple
which beleue in christ &amp; his scripture &amp; yet misconstrue it
expounding it after their owne willes
and let vs se what frute they take of this boke &amp; what it profyteth them &amp; we shall fynde that it lesse serueth these men than the fryste
for if this men beleue in chryst &amp; in his scripture
them is it not possyble that they shulde receaue or admytte that thynge
whiche is against the scripture bothe by the exposicion of them selues &amp; of al the worlde
for this is both agaynst scrypture and all faithfull men that there shulde be anye waye to helth yf we exclude christ and his scripture and syth purgatorye is counted awaye to helthe
he that wolde go aboute to proue it
secludynge chryst and scrypture is against scrypture and all faythfull men
besydes that yf they be so obstynate that they wyll not receaue the verye scripture but expounde it after theyr owne wylles &amp; wrest it after the same
then wyll they moche lesse receaue your boke which is so playne against scripture
and therfore yf yow wolde thinke that they coulde be tamed by your boke which notwitstonding so wresteth scrypture
so that i can espye no maner of profyte that can come of youre boke yf yowe can allege no better causes than yow yet shew
but that it had ben a greate dele better on wryten
and brother rastel where yow say that i auaunce &amp; boste my selfe moch more then becometh me
and that i detraycte &amp; slander my neyghbours
and that i prouoke all men that read my boke rather to vyce than to vertu with such other thynges as ye lay to my charge
i trust i shall declare my inconuenyence and geue yow a sufficient answere
an answere to rastels fyrst chapter whych reproueth me for boostynge my selfe
in the fyrst chapter of this boke rastel rastell laboureth to proue that i am sore ouer sene in laudinge &amp; bosting my selfe
and that i like my selfe so wel that he is sure that other men do lyke me the lesse
&amp; that he fereth that god wyll therfore lyke me &amp; fauour me rather the worse then the better
here he iogeleth wyth me &amp; wolde make frith me beleue that he tossed me myne owne ball agayne
but when i beholde hit
i perceaue it to be non of myn
for he hathe cut out all that shulde make for me so that he hath geuen it cleane an other shape
then euer i entended that it shulde haue as it appereth by his wryting which reherseth my wordes in this maner
i am sure there are many that merueyll rastell
that i being so yonge dare atempte to dyspute this matter against these iii persones
but my wordes are this
i am sure that frith there are manye that wyll moche meruayll that i beynge so ionge and of so small lerning dare dispute this matter
here rastell leueth out the wordes
and of so smake lernynge
for yf he had put that in he had bewrayed him selfe
for i thynke no man so madde as to saye that he which sayeth him selfe to be both yonge &amp; of small lerninge shulde prayse &amp; boste him selfe
also immediatly after the wordes of his fyrste allegacion i say on this maner
and as touchinge my lerninge i muste nedes aknowlege
as the trueth is
that it is verye smal which i thynke is but a base bostinge
and anon after i say i wolde not that any man shulde admitte my wordes or lerninge excepte they wyll stonde with the scripture
&amp; be approued therby
lay them to the touchstone and trye them with goddes worde
yf they be founde false and contrary then dampne them
and i shall also reuoke them wyth al myn harte
i exhorted them to reade my boke not aduertysynge whoo speaketh the wordes but rather what is spoken
by why the wordes you myght well se that i entended not to boste my selfe
and all this haue i wryten
and he lefte it out euen in the fyrste page
as he calleth it
wherin he reporteth that i boste my selfe
rastell
notwithstondinge one thinge doth sore vexe him that i shulde recyte the pystell of
paule wherbye he sayeth i wolde haue men beleue that i had the sprete of god and thynke
that though i be yonge that i se visyons and espye the truethe
and that my elders haue dremed dremes and wandered in phantasyes
this he recounteth to be a great boste &amp; frith that this one place shulde wynne hym the felde
where vnto i answer that in dead my wordes do not proue that thinge
which you seme so suerly to gather of them
but my wordes doo argue on this maner
that no man ought to condempne a thinge before he reade it then to geue sentence
and because you seme ignorant in the matter i shall declare it vnto you
and howe it stondithe
it is a coloure of rethoryke
and is called auantopodosis that is to saye an answer to an obieccion that a man myghte haue here made on this maner
thou grauntest thy selfe yonge and so smale lernynge doste thou then thinke that we shall once reade or regarde thy boke
speciallye sythe it is wryten agaynste auncyent men bothe of great wytte and dignyte
to this twoo poyntes i answere preuentinge theyr obieccion that they shuld not dispyse it because of my youthe
for as the sprete of god is bounde to no place
euen so is he not addicte to anye age or person but enspyreth where he wyll and when he wyll &amp; brenge in for an ensample
that he espyred yonge tymothe prouinge ther by that the youth of it selfe is not to be dispised
but accordinge to the lernynge whiche it bryngeth and that
therfore they maye not dispise my youth but fyrst read
what doctrine i bringe and therafter do iudge it
no more in this i proued not that i am enspyred and haue the sprete of god as tymothe had
but only proue that god maye enspyre youthe as he dyd tymothe
and that therfor ye ought fyrste to reade before you condempne
for you know not who is enspired &amp; who not vntyl you haue read their workes or sene their factes
thus you may se that my wordes define not that al yough is enspyred although som may be
but i exhorte that no man despyse 1 tess
1 prophesies
but proue all and approue that is good
and to make the matter more playne i shall brynge you an example of paule to the hebreus whyche exhorteth hebre
13 them to hospytalyte
for by that som men onwares haue receaued angeles to herber
be not therfore vnmyndful of it
here paule exhorteth yow to hospitalyte &amp; shewyng yow that by those meanes some men haue receaued angels into their house
wolde not haue yow thynke that al the gestes which he shal receaue shal be angels
nd not dyspysynge my yowgth because that sumtyme godde enspyreth the yonge
worde not haue yow thinke that the bokes made of yonge men
whyche ye shal receaue
shal be holsome doctrine
but some men be lewde &amp; vnfrutefull
neuerthelesse euen as yf they receiued not those gestes they shulde also put awaye angels
yf anye came so if yow despice to reade such bokes as be wryten by yonge men
yow maye also fortune to dispyce them which are wryten by the inspyracyen of chrystes sprete and therfore ye ought to reade them
but be it in cause i had in dead praysed my selfe
as i haue not
and that i had sayed that i had the sprete of god
what inconuenience shulde folowe therof
wolde yowe argue that my doctrine were false
yf that were a good argument
then were thrystes doctrine false
then were paule a false prophete and oure sayth nothynge for christ sayd to the iewes that he was the lyght of the worlde
iohn
and agayne he sayd
it is my father that glorifyed me whom you call youre god
nowe yf it had bene a sufficient argument to condempne his doctrine
because the worlde callethe it bostynge than shulde we haue beleued no truth at all
besydes that paull semeth not a lyttel to boste him selfe
11 yf men loke on it with a carnall yie
for he sayeth that he thinketh not him selfe inferior vnto the hyest apostels
&amp; sayeth agayne that yf they glorye to be the mynisters of chryste
thoughe he speake vnwyslye
he is more copyous in laboures
in strypes aboue measure
in preson more often
often at the poynte of dethe
shulde we for this wordes thynke that his doctrine were not ryght
naye verelye that doth not inproue the doctrine
but that it may be good and holsome for a man may boste himselfe and doo well so he referre the prayse to god from
whom all goodnes cometh
but be it in case that i shulde say that god of his mere mercy &amp; for the loue that he oweth me in chryste
and his bloude had geuen me his sprete that i might be to his laude &amp; prayse to whom be thankes for euer
amen
wolde you thyncke that this were so greate abostinge that the doctrine shulde be impayred therbye
ah blynde gydes i praye god geue you the lyght of vnderstondinge
i beseche you brother rastell be not discontent wyth me yf i axe you one questyon
be ye a chrysten man or no
i am sure you wyl answere yes
then yf i broughte you the texte of paule whiche sayeth
rome
he that hathe not the sprate of god is non of his
i praye you how wil you auoyde it notwithstonding yf you wolde auoyde that texte
yet wyl i say an other blocke in the waye that you shall not be able to remoue
and that is the sayinge of paule
corinth
knowe ye not your selues that chryste is in you
excepte ye be reprobate persones
now howe soeuer you wolde iudge of youre selfes
i thynke verely that i am no suche &amp; therfore where as before i dyd not so wryte
now i certifye yow that i am chrystes , conclude what ye wyl
and the day shal come that you shal suerlye knowe that so it is
albeit in meane season i be reputed a laughingstoke in this worlde for i knowe in whome i truste and he came not deceue me
then bryngeth he agaynste me that i bastell saye we haue bene longe secluded frome the scripture
&amp; also that oure fore fathers haue not had the lyghte of godes worde opened vnto them
i meruayll what rastell meanethe by frith bryngynge this for his purpose
for i thinke it no bostinge of my selfe
but yf ye thynke that it be vntrue
i thinke he is very blinde
for what scripture hathe the poore commens bene admitted vnto euen tyll this daye
it hath ben and locked vp in a strange tounge and from them that haue attayned the knowlege of
that tounge hath it ben locked with a thousand salse gloses of antichrystes makynge and innumerable lawes
and where i saye oure fore fatheres haue not hadde the lyght of goddes worde opened vnto them
i meane that they haue not the scrypture in theyr own mother tonge
that they might haue conferred these iuggeling mistes wyth the lyght of goddes worde as the processe of my wordes can testifye whiche he hathe holy lefte out
but i beseche the chrysten reader once to read the place for my discharge and his confusyon
ye shall fynde it in the seconde leaf of my boke
and now he allegeth agaynste me that i shulde saye this
rastell iudge chrysten reader what reasons rastell hathe broughte and how he hath soluted them
for in my mynde bothe his reasons and solucyons are so childyshe and vnsauery
so vnlerned and baren so fulle of fautes and phantasyes that i rather pitye the mannes depe ignoraunce &amp; blyndnes
which hath so deceyued him self thorowe phylosophye and naturall reason
then i feare that he by his vayne probacyons shulde allure any man to consent vnto him
i thynke rastell layeth not this against me
because i boste my selfe in thes wordes
and verely as touchinge the truthe of those wordes i wyll adde thus moche more vnto them
that i neuer wys man that was counted wyse whyche hath broughte so slender reasons excepte he entended to destroye a thynge which ye seme to haue bylde
rastell
and fynallye where as i exorte all men to iudge and conferre the scriptures whych syr thomas more and my lorde of rochestre allege for theyr opinions
and wolde haue them to pondre theyr reasons and my solucions vnto them annexinge these wordes i am sure that my smale lernynge hath condempned theyr hye eloquence
that my folye hathe brought to nought theyr wisdom and that my youth hath disclosed their festered ignoraunce
there rastell thynketh that i stonde frith well in my owne conceyte and boste my selfe aboue the mone because i touche master more his kynsman
but let rastell take this for an answer
yf master more wolde kepe him within his owne bondes that is wythe medelynge of worldlye matteres onlye
i wolde neuer compare wyth him
yet he muste remember that a dawler maye correcte him in his owne crafte
but it is euen as socrates saythe
when a man is wyse in one thing then wyll he take vppon hym to defyne all thynges and be ignoraunt in nothynge and so dysdayneth
the gyfte that he hathe and proueth himselfe onwyse
furthermore i se no great prayse that i here attribute vnto my selfe
but confesse my smalle lernynge my folie and my youth
neuerthelesse yf he recounte it a prayse because i saye it hath condempned theyr hye eloquence and theyr wysdom
and disclosed theyr ignoraunce
then let him also annexe the wordes that i wrote sayinge
and it is euen the olde practyse of god to chose the folyshe thynges of the worlde to confounde the wyse
to chose the weake
to confounde the myghtye
and to chose the vyle thynges whyche are of no reputacion to confounde them of hye degre
that no fleshe myghte boste it selfe in his syghte to whome only be prayse and thankes for euer amen
where all men maye se that i referre all prayse to hym whych onlye is worthye
and so i maye conclude that you haue not loked indifferentlye on my boke
an answere vnto rastels seconde chaptre whych improueth me for raylynge and dyspraysynge other
in the seconde chaptre he rangethe rastell the felde and sercheth out wythe all diligens what worde i haue spoken that myght be taken in the worste sence
and calleth them raylynge gestynge and scoldinge and because he wolde haue me to be abhorred of the reader
he allegeth not onlye these wordes that are spoken agaynste himselfe
but also that are spoken agaynste my lorde of rochestre and sir thomas more
not that he entendeth to answer for them or to defende theyr partyes ye maye be sure
but only to leue nothinge behynde which shulde seme to make for him
lyke a noble oratour the wordes that he reproueth are these
there rastell taketh his fondacion vp rastell pon a starke lye
and there he maketh ii lyes
and there he maketh iii lyes
here i wolde desyre my brother rastel frith to pardon me of a lyttell ignoraunce
for surely i thought it had bene no more offence to call a lye
a lye
them to cal a jew a shepe
notwithstondinge sith he recountethe it to be raylinge geslynge and scoldinge
i wyll here after tempre my selfe
and change my wordes
and wyll saye that whan he lyethe
that by hys leue
he maketh a fytten
it angreth him when i saye that rastell rastell hathe lost his wytte in purgatory
and therfore i wyll saye so no more
frith but this i wyl affyrme
be rastel neuer so furyous
that who so euer maketh such reasons and solucions
and counteth them good in erneste
that he hathe no wytte in his hede
where so euer he loste it
but yf you wolde reade rastels fyrste argumente whyche i haue sette in my boke in the twelfe leaf
then you shall perceyue whether i saye truethe or not
also he allegeth that i shulde say
that rastell sayinge of rastell is agaynst scrypture
but yf he counte that raylynge and wolde not haue me saye so much vnto hym
i wyll counte the man somwhat statlye
and this frith i ensure hym that yf god suffre me to leue i wyll saye so agayne
take it as he wyll
also he recyteth as a great reproche rastell that i shulde saye
i meruayle howe oure scolemen maye abyde this felowe
and surelye the same i say againe for frith he prouethe bothe
saynte thomas and them also foles and double foles
whyche yf i shulde so doo wolde be counted haynous heresye
then he reherseth what i say of master rastell more and my lorde of rochestre
and all to helpe his mater
that when i say the smal probacions and slender reasons that those ii wytted men
syr thomas more and my lorde of rochestre had brought to confyrme purgatory made my harte to yerne
what raylynge or yestynge this is let frith other men iudge
but this i dare auow that i sayd the truthe
for what shulde a man do or say to se them so contrary in their tales master more saith that their is fyer &amp; no water in purgatory
&amp; my lord of rochester saith that their is both fier &amp; water more saith that the mynister of punyshment are deuels
and my lorde of rochester sayeth that the minister of punyshment are angels
master more sayeth that bothe the grace and charyte of them that lye in paynes of purgatory are increased
my lord of rochestre saith the soules of purgatorye obtayne there nother more
fayth nor grace nor charyte then they brought in with them
now iudge good reader whether i haue rayled or sayed the truethe
but all this doth rastell leue oute full craftely
he recyteth ful diligently bothe the hede &amp; tayle
but the middle which expoundeth the matter wyll he not let you se
he allegeth also agaynst me that i say rastell master more is sore disceyued and set on the sand euen at the fyrste brunte
and in the begynnynge of his viage and that i wolde wysh master more a lyttell more wytte
euen that i say agayne and affyrme it frith to be true
and is so euydently proued in the begynnynge of my answere agaynste master more that i neade to saye nothynge
but only referre the reader vnto the place
also he improueth me for sayinge in an rastell other place that master more sheweth hym in one texte twyse ignoraunte and that he is to busye
for he vnderstondeth not the phrase of scrypture
this and suche other sayinges he allegeth frith
which i passe ouer
for i counte it folye to spende paper and laboure aboute the rehersynge of them
for yf you reade my boke you shall se all these poyntes so playnly proued that he moughte be ashamed to make mencion of them
this he counteth gestinge sclanderinge rastell and raylinge sayinge that no reasonable man wyll thynke these poyntes to be thinges belonginge to vertue
but rather spyces and branches of pryde
and that i shewe not my selfe therin charitable but rather malicious nor no wysdom therin
but rather folye
addynge that yf i had bene halfe yere at two scoles
that is to saye the scole of discrecion and the scole of cheryte
i shulde more haue prospered in vertuous lernyng then i haue done in other scoles this vii yere
and sayeth that i haue ben at the scoles of slanderynge raylinge and gestinge
dere brother yf it had bene so that i frith had spoken certayne wordes in deade which might haue semed in your yies to be raylinge
detractinge and slanderynge
as i haue not
sauynge a lyttell gestyng
wolde you disproue my doctrine therby
what wyl you then say to s
john baptist which called the pharyses
then hedes of the churche
as are now our doctours
generacion of viperes
wolde you therfore conclude that his doctrines where noughte
i thynke you be not so chyldishe
and it semeth this one sentence to be more raylinge and slanderlyng then all that i haue wryten
what wyll you say to chryste which called the scrybes and pharyses hypocrytes
he semethe to rayle aboue measure
where he calleth them hypocrites
and blynde gydes
paynted sepulchers
whiche onwardlye appere ryghtwyse but wythin are full of ypocrysye
serpentes and generacion of vipers
besydes that he calleth herode fox
he sayeth o vnfaythful and ouerwharte nacyon
wolde you thynke it shulde excuse the iewes whyche refused his doctrine to saye that he rayled
and that no reasonable man wolde thynke those thynges to be poyntes belonginge to vertu
but rather spices and braunches of pryde and that he shewed not hymselfe charitable
but malicious
nor no wysdome therin but folye
wolde it excuse them to say
as you do to me
that yf he had bene one halfe yere at scole of discrecion and chartye
he shulde more haue prospered in vertuous lernynge &amp; that he had ben at the scoles of sclandering
raylinge &amp; iestynge
finally
paul in your yies might appere to raile &amp; slander &amp; to be clene destitute of goddes sprete
which as luc
saieth replenished with the holy gost said to elemas that resisteth him act
o thou full of al suttelty &amp; deceite thou sonne of the deuel &amp; enemy of all rightwisnes ceaseth not to peruerte the rightwayes of the lord
i can bringe many such sainges of peter joh
james &amp; judas &amp; yet i thinke you will not inproue their doctrine therby but because i studye to be shorte
i shal counte it sufficient to haue warned the reder of this
notwithstonding ꝑaduenture rastel wyl not yet be answered
but wil say that albeit i haue touched ynough as concerning those thinges that appere rayling &amp; sla ̄ derig in his yies
yet i brought non that iest as i do
wher vnto i maye answere &amp; allege for me the prophet which both mocked the false prestes &amp; gested with them
sayinge calle lowde vnto your godes for ꝑaduenture they are a slepe &amp; can not here
or els they be gone out of towne
i can not ynough meruell that my brother rastel wolde vse such maner of reasoning with me as to improue my doctrine because of my raylinge and gestynge
for therwith he hathe made a foule hole in his kinsmans beste cote for euery man perceyueth that m
more his bokes are so full of raylinge
gesting &amp; bandye tales
that yf the furyous momus &amp; venus had take out their pertyes theyre shulde be verye lyttel lefte for vulcanus
after this rastell dissenteth to the purpose rastell of his mater &amp; wolde proue that my exposicions of scripture are not good
because they are an occasyon to brynge the people to boldnes of synne &amp; to moue the people to deylte in other mens fautes
and to laughte therat
and to put you an ensample
he sayeth
yf i shulde take vppon me the exposicion of this texte
and expounde it after this maner
in the begynnynge of this yere john frith is a noble clarke he kylled a mylstone wyth his spere kepe wel your geese your dogs do barke
i trowe sayeth rastell all wyse men wolde thinke that this were a fonde exposicion and yet this exposicoyn wolde please chylderne foles and mad men
as well as the exposicy on of saynt austayne or saynte hierom or any other doctour of the churche
because it wolde make them to laugh , so
sayeth rastell
frith maketh suche exposicions wyth yestynge and raylinge to make the people laugh
not regardinge to edifye the people
nor to prouoke them to vertue mekenes or charyte nor to leue theyr synne
but rather geueth than bouldenes and to beleue that their is no purgatory nor hell
but mocketh and yestethe at those reasons that be made for proue of purgatorye
nowe as touchynge the fyrste parte
where frith he sayeth that my exposicions be an occasion to brynge the people to bouldenes of synne
i axe him why
his answer is because i geue them boldnes that there is no purgatory
nor yet hell
therto rastel by his leue
maketh a fitten
i dare not say he maketh a lye for that he wolde call raylynge for i neuer denyed hel
but affirme in many places of my boke and euen in the fyrste syde of myn answer againste hym i affyrme hel
and perpetuall dampnacion
but when ye come to the profe of his wordes
then you shall se howe wyslye the man concludethe
men shal thinke it a good consequent as yf i shulde say that we lacke fyer in preson
then wolde he conclude that there lacked fyer in all middelsex or yf i wolde saye theyr were no wytte in rastels heed
then wolde he conclude that theyr were no wytte in no mannes hede
he hath so longe studied phylosophye
that he hath cleane forgotten his principals of sophistry
notwythstondinge we wyl forgeue him this faute for the man is somwhat aged and therfore i thynke it is longe synes he readde them
and that they are nowe oute of his memory
neuertheles he wyl say that his argument is not soluted for althougth i denye not hell
yet i denye purgatory
and so i geue the people an occasion to synne
because they fere not purgatorye
where vnto i haue so sufficiently answered in rastels seuenthe argument that i wonder that he is not a shamed to brengen the same agayne
but he trusteth that my bokes shal neuer be reade
and his may goo surely abrode
and therfore he may say what he wyll only he caryed not what he sayeth so he holde not his peace
and where he reporteth that i make exposicions rastell to make the people to delyte to here of other mens fautes and to laughe therat
therto wyll i say naye
tyll he be at leysure to proue it
&amp; where he sayethe
yf he shulde frith
take vppon him to expounde
rastell in the begynnynge of this yere john frith is a noble clarke he kylled a mylstone wyth his spere kepe wel your geese your dogs do barke
sayinge that all wyse men wolde say that this were a founde exposicion
therto i answere that
sayinge
fryth for the time &amp; meter they might wel say that a gose had made it for any reason
that is therin
and as touchynge the meter
the seconde verse lacketh a foote
and is shorter than his felowes
but yf you putte oute this worde frith
&amp; put in this worde rastel for it
then shal his meter also be ꝑfeyte
&amp; that haltinge verse shall runue merelye wyth his felowes vppon his ryght feete on this maner
in the beginninge of this yere iohn rastell is a noble clarcke he kylled a mylstone with his spere kepe wel your geese the dogges do barke thus i haue amended his meter
but as for the reason i leue it to him selfe to amende it at his laysure
in the ende of his seconde chaptre he saith that i entende with my exposicions to bringe the people to beleue in iiii other great erroures
wher of the i is that there is no hell
ordeyned for anye that is of chrystes fayth
although he do neuer so many synnes but let vs se how he proueth it
an answer to rastels iii chap
whiche wolde proue that i denye hell
rastell it semeth
sayth rastell
by the reasons that frithe hath alleged that his entente is to brynge the people in beleue that there is no hell
for i allege in my answer to rastels dialoge the saieng of
christ chose vs in him before the begyn ̄ ing of the worlde that we myghte be holy &amp; without spot in his syght &amp; againe eph
christe loued his congregacion &amp; gaue himselfe for it that he mighte sanctifye it in the fontayne of water thorow the worde to make it without spotte or wryncle or anye such thynge
but that it shuld be holy &amp; without blame
and vppon these textes i conclude
that yf frith
christ haue so purged vs that we are withoute spotte
wryncle or bame in his syghte
as paul testifyeth
then wyll he neuer cast vs in to purgatory
for what shulde be purged in them
that are wythout spotte wrincle or blame
and then somewhat to declare the matter howe we be synners as longe as we leue
and yet wythout synne in the syght of god and adde this wordes why he i wolde that all men dede well note them and because rastell leuythe out the beste of the matter
i wyll reherse my owne wordes agayne
peraduenture euerye man perceyuethe not what this meaneth that we are ryghtwyse in his syght
seynge that euery man is a synner
therfore i wyll breuely declare the meanynge of the apostell
this is fyrste a clere case that there leueth no man vppon the erthe wythout synne
notwythstondynge all they that were chosen in christ before the foundacyon of the worlde were layd are wythout spot of synne in the syght of god
so that they are bothe synners and ryghtwyseyf we consyder the imperfeccyon of oure fayth and charyte
yf we consyder the conflicte of the flesshe and the sprete
yf we consyder oure rebellyous membres whyche are vnder sinne romanorum
then are we greuous synners
and contrary wyse
yf we beleue that of that mercyfull fauoure god gaue his mooste dere sonne to redeme vs frome oure synne
yf we beleue that he imputethe not oure synnes vnto vs
but that his wrathe is pacefyed in chryste and his bloude , if we beleue that he hath frelye geuen vs his christ and wyth hym all thynges
so that we be destitute of no gyfte
then are we ryghtwyse in his syghte and oure concience at peace wyth god
not thorowe oure selfes
but thorow oure lorde iesu chryste
so mayste thou perceyue that thou arte a synner in thy selfe
and yet arte thou ryghtwyse in chryste
for thorow him is not thy synne imputed nor rekened vnto the
and so are they to whom god imputeth not theyr synnes
blessed ryghtwyse , wythoute spotte wryncle or blame
and therfore wyll he neuer thrust them in to purgatorye
and for proue of this i allege
as rastell bereth me wytnes
dyuers textes of saynt paull
ephesians
rastell but that notwithstondenge rastell sayethe that i haue not recyted them sufficiently
for i haue lefte out sumwhat whyche i haue rehersed for the openyng of the truethe
and than brengyth in that saynte paull exhorteth and
we shall vse no fornicacyon on clennes auarice fylth or folysh speaches for suche shall haue no inherytance in the kingdom of heauen
and euen so saye i to
but iudge good reader what is this to the purpose
frith for it neyther maketh for purgatorye neither against it
this texte i coulde haue alleged yf i had endeuered my selfe that we shulde do good workes
which i neuer knew chrysten man denye
but els as touchynge my mater it is nothynge to the purpose and as wel he might haue improued me
because i brenge in no texte to proue that the father of heuen is god
or to proue that which neuer man doubted of
then he allegeth paul
sayinge rastell though grace do rayne thorow chryste shall we therfore dwel in synne
nay god forbyde sayth paule
and euen so say i againe
that there is no dampnacion to them which be in chryst iesu if they lyue not after the fleshe
and euen so saye i
but rastell wyll say the contrary anon
besydes that he allegethe roman
we be frelye iustifyed by grace
by chrystes redempcion to shewe his iustice for the remission of synne done before
and yet sayth rastell
paull sayeth that the lawe is not destroyed by faythe but made stable
but this hath frith lefte oute of his booke to cause the people to beleue that they be clene purged
by the bloude of chryste only
and that there neade no purgatorye
by these wordes you maye euydentlye frith perceyue what rastell meanethe by this allegynge of paul
for the establyshynge of the lawe
verelye that the worke of the lawe shulde iustifye and cleane purge you from synne whyche is contrarye to paull and al scripture
for euen in this same chapytre that he allegeth paull sayeth
that of workes of the lawe noo flesshe shal be iustyfyed in his syghte
and sayeth that the ryghtwysnes of god cometh by fayth of iesu chryste vnto all and vppon all that beleue
but as touchynge good workes i wyll touche more hereafter
furthermore rastell sayeth that yf my argumentes could proue that there is no purgatory
it muste folow as well that there is no hell for vs that be chrysten men though we continue styll in synne
for yf we be blessed without spot wryncle or blame
&amp; that therfore he wyll not caste vs in to purgatorye
then he wyll not caste vs in to hell what soeuer synne we do commytte
here rastell vtterith his blyndnes vnto frith you
and sheweth you what vnderstondinge he hathe in scripture
fyrste he armeth hymselfe with a false supposicyon and yet there vppon he concludeth his argument falselye his supposicion is this
that all men whiche are baptysed with materiall water are verye chrysten men
and haue the true faythe &amp; be those which paule affirmeth to be without spotte blame or wryncle
but therto i say nay
for euen as the outwarde circumcisyon made not the iewes the electe people and chylderne of saluacyon
so doth not the outwarde baptisme make vs the faythfull membres of chryste
but as they were the chyldren of god which were inwardly circumcysed
euen so they that are wasshed inwardly from the concupiscens of this worlde are the membres of chryste
whom paul affyrmeth so to be purged thorowe his bloude
againe
you may knowe that rastell knoweth no nother fayth
but that whiche maye stonde wyth all maner of synne
but the faith which we speake of is the same which worketh thorow charyte
wherof paull speaketh
they that haue this faythe are borne of god and synne not
these that haue this fayth do hope and loke dayly for deliueraunce out of this thraldome and bodye of synne
and in the meane ceason they purefye them selfe as he is pure
for yf a man wyll saye that he knoweth chryste or beleueth in hym and kepeth not his commaundementes
he is a lyar and we renounce hym to be any of this membre that we speake of
and when rastell sayeth i wolde conclude there is no hell for them that be chrysten men thoughe they contynue styll in synne
i answere he that commytteth synne is of the deuell
and i saye agayne that the chrysten that we spoke of whiche are the chylderne of god can not continue styll in synne
but seke all meanes to fulfyll godes commaundementes
notwythstondinge the chrysten whiche rastell speaketh of which are the chylderne of the deuel may do as they lyste
and in dead they hadd nead to make a frende of rastell to helpe them in to his purgatorye yf it be any better than hell
for they shal neuer come in heauen
excepte they repent and walke innocentlye in this worlde as chryst
and his lettel flocke haue euer donne
for they that walke otherwyse are non of his
thoughe they were myteres
this lyttel flocke it is that are so purged
and not rastels multitude
and for this is there nother hell nor purgatorye ordeyned
euen as for this hepe that continue styll in synne is ordeyned noo heauen
and that there is no hell ordeyned for these faythfull followers of chryste
i wyl proue euen by this worde of paul that there is no dampnacion to them that be in chryste iesu
yf they leue not after the flesh
here rastell hath smyte the ball quyte vnder the corde and hathe alleged that
that shall condempne hym
for yf there be no dampnacion
but because you are somwhat slow in perceyuing the matter i shal reduce it in to a sillogismus on this maner
maior there is no dampnacion vnto them that be in chryst iesu yf they lyue not after the fleshe
but after the sprete , euery hell is dampnacion ergo their is no hell to them that be in chryste iesu
if they lyue not after the flesshe but after the sprete
this is in the fyrste fygure made by celarent
not by any profyte that i thynke that the poore commenes can take by such babelinge but only to satisfie your mynde and pleasure
notwithstondynge one thynge i must put you in remembraunce
that you haue falslye translated the texte for the text hath not that condicionall all thought i was contented to take it at your handes to se what you coulde proue
but the text saith thus thers is no dampnacion to them that are in christe jesu
which walke after the fleshe but after the sprete
where paul doth certifie you that they which are in christe jesu
walke not after the flesh but after the sprete
so that you may gather by paull that if they walke not after the sprete they are not in chryst jesu
that is to say
they are non of christes
althoughe rastell wyll call them christen men
therfore dere brothren loke that no man deceiue him selfe
for chryst is not the minister of synnes
if we be deliuered from synne thorow chryst
them must we walke in a new conuersacion of our life
or els we are styll in darknes
we haue this precious treasure in frayle
brytell and erthye vessels
let vs therfore wyth feare and tremblinge worke oure helth
and make stable our vocacion &amp; eleccion
for if we retayne the truthe and knowlege of god
vnryghtwysnes we shall shortly perceyue the wrath of god vppon vs with infynite delusions
&amp; the ende of vs shal be worse then the begysiinge
awake therfore &amp; vnder stonde your helthe
nowe you maye se how he concludeth that i establyshe this erroure
that there is no hell for seinge myne argumentes
do conclude that there is no hell
nor dampnacyon to them that are in chryst jesu
and are his faythfull followeres
he thynketh it shulde well folowe that yf there be no hell for them
that there is no hell for no man
for in his seconde chaptre and also in the beginninge of the thyrde he sayeth that i denye hell
&amp; when we come to his probacion
there is nothinge sayd but that which paule confyrmeth
that is there is no dampnacion for them that are in chryste jesu
whyche walke not after the fleshe but after the spret whych are thorow chryst withoute spotte wryncle or blame
and so thoughte rastell appere to him selfe to conclude lyke a sage philosopher
yet i answer you he concludeth lycke an ignoraunte sophyster as almen may se
for it foloweth not
paule and frith saye there is no hell
as contrary wyse it foloweth not there is no heauen for rastels chrysten men whych contynue styll in synne ergo there is no heauen for the deuell ther father
and then it is there heauen for chryst and his electe
i haue before declared how chrystes electe are synners and no synners
and nowe because you shulde not mistake the textes of s
john which i before alleged i wyll shewe you how they do co ̄ mitte synn
which i dyde also sufficientlye touche in my answere agaynste rastels dialoge
euen ii leues from the ende
and yet i wyll touche it agayne
because you shall not thynke that i wolde not lede you in ygnoraunce and darknes
there are ii partes in a faythefull man whiche rebell agaynst other and are at contynuall stryffe and both of them haue dyuers names in scrypture
the one is called the inwarde man the harte
the mynde
the wyll
and the sprete
the other is called the outwarde man the rebellyous membres the body of synne and the flesshe
and these in a faythfull man kepe contynuall warre
and albeit the one be subdued and taken presonner of the other
yet neuer consenteth to his enemye
he can not leue hym
neyther wyll make peace with him
but wyll labour what he can and wyll call for all that he thynketh wyll helpe him to be delyuered from his enemye
and then wareth vppon him a freshe
what tyme the faythfull man is brought to the knowlege of god and beleueth in chryste and hathe his wyll &amp; mynde
renewed with the sprete of god that consenteth to the law of god
that is good ryghtuous &amp; holye and begynneth to loue the lawe and hath a wyl and a desyre to fulfyll the law of god &amp; not to dispyse his heuenly father and loke how moche he loueth the law countynge it ryghwys and holy
euen so moche doth he hate synne which the law forbiddeth and abhorreth it in his harte and inwarde man
and then albe it the outwarde man and rebellyous membres doo at tyme besege him &amp; take hym captyue vnder synne
yet doth not the inwarde man consent that this synne is good and the law naught
whiche forbyddeth it
neyther do the harte delyte in this same synne
neyther delite in such synne because the sprete of god testifieth vnto hym that it is abhominable in the sighte of god
that he dyd not that good thynge which he wolde
but the euell whiche he hated that he dyd
that is he dyd not fulfyl the good law of god
as his harte wyll and inwarde man desyred
but dyd the euell as touchinge his flesh &amp; outwarde man
then is it not i that do it but the synne that dwelleth in me
&amp; euen lykewyse the faythful followers of christe committe no synne
for they hate it
and yf they fortune to be entangled with synne
it is not they that do it
as paule sayth
but the synne that dwelleth in them whiche god hath lefte to exercyse them as he lefte the philistins to exercise &amp; nurtour the children of israel
&amp; if the re ̄ nau ̄ tes of sinne fortune at any time to loke a lofte &amp; beginne to rayne
but when we be once dyd
then our membres rebel no more
&amp; then nedeth neyther purpatory nor any other crosse for the outwarde man is tourned in to vanite
and our inward man was euer pure thorow beleuinge the worde of god
&amp; neuer consented to synne
&amp; neadeth nother purgatorye in this worlde nor in the worlde to come
but only for subduinge the outwarde man
&amp; therfore after this lyfe he shall neuer haue any purgatorye
marke well what i saye &amp; reade it againe
for more shal reade it then shall vnderstonde it
but he that hathe eares let him heare
the seconde erroure that rastel layeth to my charge is that i wolde bringe the people in beleue that repentance of a man helpeth not for the remission of his synne
in prouinge this seconde errour againste me rastell taketh so great paynes that he is almoste besydes him selfe
for he sayth that i wolde make men beleue that it forsith not
whether they synne or no
why so brother rastel
verely because i allege
ezechiell &amp; hieremye to quenche the note fyer of purgatory and allege no auctorityes to proue good workes
wher vnto i answer
as i dyd before
that it is nothing to my purpose
for the prouing of good workes doth neyther make for purgatorye nor agaynste it
i coulde haue alleged all those textes yf i had entended my selfe to proue that i shulde do good workes
which i neuer knew chrysten man denye
but as touching my mater it is nothi ̄ nge to the purpose &amp; as well he myght haue improued me because i brynge in no textes to proue that the father of heauen is god
or to proue that whych neuer man doubted of
notwythstondynge yf rastell had indifferent yies
i spake sufficientlye of good workes in the 34
argument againste his dialoge let all men reade the place and iudge
rastell taketh the mater very greuously rastell that i attempte to allege howe s
iohn s
paule sende vs to chryste
and then adde that we know no nother to take away synne but only christe
&amp; because i adde this worde onlye
therfore he thinketh that i clene destroye repentaunce where vnto i answere frith that i added not this worde only
for noughte but i dyd it by the auctorite of s
iohn which sayth
yf we walke in the lyght as he is in the lyght we haue felowship with eche other &amp; in the bloude of iesu chryste his sone purifyeth vs from all synne
whervppon i saye that for vs which are in the light
his bloude only is sufficient
but for your chrysten men which continue styll in synne &amp; walke in darkenes after theyr father the deuell , must som other meannes be founde or els they shal neuer entre in to the kyngdome of heauen
but because i wyll be shorte let rastel note that i finde ii maner of repentance one is without fayth &amp; is such a repentance as iudas &amp; rastels christen men which continue styll in synne
haue at the later ende whyche doth rather purchace than an halter then the remission of synnes
an other repentance foloweth iustificacion &amp; remission of synnes &amp; is a floryshynge frute of fayth
for when by fayth we do perceyue the fauour &amp; kyndnes that our louing father hath shewed vs in his sone chryst iesu
and that he hath reconcyled vs vnto himselfe by the bloude of his sone
then beginne we to loue him
the more we hate the body of synne &amp; lament and be sory that our membres are so frayle
that they can not fulfyll the lawe of god and so in mornynge and bewaylynge oure infyrmyte
it causeth vs to abstayne from bothe
meate &amp; drinke &amp; all worldly pleasures which is the pure fastinge that we talke of
but you vnderstonde it not
and this repentance commeth not to purge the synnes which is committed before
but onlye taketh an occasion by the synnes before committed to knowe what poyson their remayned in our flesshe &amp; seaketh al meanes to make vs hate this body of synne and to subdue it with all maner of workes that god hath appoynted to th entent that it shulde in tyme to come no more displease god oure mooste mercyfull father which of gentelnes so often pardoneth and forgeueth vs
as i haue touched before
this is the maner of repentaunce which i fynde in scrypture
but this helpeth that we shulde synne no more
but what rastell dremethe i woote not
but to expresse to the vttermoste what i meane by repentaunce
marke this example yf a man bylde an house which doth coste him moch labour and mony
&amp; haue layde no sure fundacion
but that when a tempeste commith his house doth fall
then wyll he be very sory
and repent that he hath so folishly bestowed his mony &amp; labour
notwithstondinge al this great sorow and repentaunce can not set vp his house agayne which is fallen
but only it taketh an occasyon by the ruyne of the house to teache the owner witte againste another tyme that when he buildeth agayne he may make a sure foundacion
euen so thought thou repent neuer so much that can not gette remission for the synnes that is paste
but that muste be pardoned onlye by the faythe of chrystes bloude
neuerthelesse it dothe teach the wytt &amp; lerne the to tame thy body and subdue it
&amp; cast a lowe fondacion
that in tyme thou mayste the better resyste the assautes of the deuell
the worlde &amp; the flesshe
this doth frith teache of repentaunce
let the worlde take it as they wyll
but chyrstes shepe do here his voyce
the thirde errour which rastell layeth aginst me is that i wolde make men beleue that they neade to do penaunce for the satisfaction for theyr synnes
every chyld may answer him to this yf he ouer reade or perceyue what i wrote before of repentaunce
for as they take repentaunce for the sorowe and mornyng that foloweth the cryme
euen so they calle penaunce the good workes that ensue of repentance
&amp; this good workes which folow do mortifie the membres
&amp; exercyse vs in goddes commaundementes that we synne no more
but they can get no more remission of the synne which is once past them that which they call repentaunce &amp; yet do we neyther destroye sorowynge for synne nor good workes as he falslye reporteth by vs
but we teach you how they ought to be done &amp; that they are fruytes of fayth
&amp; mortifye our membres and are profitable to our neyghbour
&amp; a testymony vnto vs that we ar chyldren of our heuenly fat
as by example i say that nother the sonne nor the mon ̄ e do iustifie vs
or purchase remission of our synnes &amp; yet i wolde not that rastel shulde saye that i denye or destroye the sonnes the moue
for i saye it that withoute that we can haue no day
&amp; that we can not be without them
and as touching the solucion of this that penaunce takinge in his largest significacion
both for good workes &amp; taking of paynes is not satisfaction for synnes
i muste tell you once againe that there are ii maner of satisfaccions
the one is to god
the other to my neyghbour
to god can not all the world make satisfaction for one crime
in so moche that yf euery grasse of the grounde were a man as holy as euer was
paull or peter &amp; shulde pray to god all ther lyfe longe for one cryme
yet coulde they not make satisfaction for it
but it is only the bloude of chryste that hath made full satisfaction vnto god
for all suche crymes
or els were there no nother remedye
but we shuld al peryshe
there is an other satisfaction whiche is to my neighbor whom i haue offended
whom i am bounde to pacifie as we ii can agre
&amp; as the lawes of the realme determine betwene vs
as if i had deformed him
them am i bounde to pacefye hym &amp; to restore hym to his good name agayne
if i haue morthered any man then by the lawes of the realme i must dye for it to pacifye my neyghbour &amp; the comen welthe
but yet i am sure rastell is not so childish as to thinke that this ciuile satisfaction is the verye satisfaction which pacifyeth gods wrath for breking his law
for if thou morther a man &amp; shuld dye
times for it yet except thou haue satisfaction of cristes bloud thou shalt be dampned therto
and so i spake that no temporall payne was instituted of god for th entent that we shuld satisfye gods wrathe therby
as it is playne in my boke rastell coulde see
the fourthe errour that he layethe agaynste me is that i wolde perswade the people that good workes are nothynge auaylable
now are we come to the fourth erroure where rastel vntrulye reporteth on me that i wolde perswade the people that good workes don by any man in this world is nothynge auaylable vnto him that doth them and that it is no hurte nor hynderaunce vnto any man thought he neuer do none
because i saye they iustyfye not before god
therfore he thynketh that other men woide vnderstonde me as wyselye as he doth
and argue that they are nothynge auaylable
but i muste desyre him to put on his spectacle
and loke agayne vppon my boke
and he shall fynde these wordes
paraduenture thou wylt answer vnto me
shall i then do good deades
i answer yes , thou wilt answer me wherfore
i answer thou muste do them because god hathe commaunded them
i answer thou arte lyuinge in this worlde wyth men
and hath conuersacion with them
therfore hath god appointed the what thou shalt do to the profyte of thy neyghboure of thy fleshe
as paull testifyethe
we are his worke in chryst iesu
vnto good workes
which workes god hath prepared that we shulde walke in them
these workes god wolde haue vs do that the vnfaythfull myght see the godlye and vertuose conuersacion of his faythfull and therby be compelled to glorifye oure father whiche is in heauen
and so are they both profytable vnto thy neyygboure and also a testymonie vnto the by the which a man may knowe that thou arte the ryght sonne of they heauenly father and a verye chryst vnto thy neyghbour
&amp; after teacheth that we oughte to do these workes without hauinge respecte eyther to heauen or hell
but attendinge thorow charite the welth of our neyghbour &amp; c i wonder , that rastell is not ashamed to say that i wolde make them beleue that they ar not auaylable
therfore good reader note my wordes
fyrst i saye we muste do them because god hath commaunded them
is it not auaylable to kepe the commaundementes of god
secondaryly i saye that they are to the perfyte of my neighbour
is it not auaylable
therdely i say that they tame oure fleshe
is it not auaylable
fourthely i saye they are to the glorie of god is it not auaylable
fiftlye i say they are a testymony to them that dothe them by the which men may knowe that he is the verye sonne of god
is that not awaylable
belyke rastell counteth nothyng auaylable but that which iustyfieth before god
he wyl say the sonne is not auailable because it iustifieth not
fyer is not auaylable in his yies because it iustifyeth not
then rastell saith that i make a wonders worke with the scrypture
and allegeth certayne textes that we ought to do good workes
which i neuer denied
&amp; thervppon wolde conclude that workes saue &amp; iustifie
&amp; plaieth me the bal lustlye ouer the corde
but as god wolde there stode a poste ryght in the waye &amp; he hytte it so full
that it made the ball to rebounde ouer agayne backward
for in the alleginge of his purpose paul sayeth eph
he hathe cleane loste the game
the wordes are these
by grace you be saued by youre faithe &amp; that is not of you
it is the gyfte of god and not of workes that no man shulde glorifye him sefe
we are the workes created of god in chryste iesu which god hathe prepared that we shulde walke in them
here because he wolde haue the latter ende of the texte to serue for his purpose whiche teacheth good workes
which i neuer denyed
he bringeth in that thynge which clene confuteth his opinion for his opinion which in all places he hath laboured to proue
is that we are saued by good workes
but now marke what he allegeth out of paule by grace you be saued by your faith
&amp; that is not of you
it is the gyfte of god &amp; not of workes
for that no man shulde glorifye hym selfe
here paule saith plainly that oure saluacion is not of workes
&amp; so hathe rastell cast don that he bilt before
&amp; maye be likened to a shrowde cowe
whiche whan she hath geuen a large messe of milke torneth it don with her hele
thus haue i answered to as moche of rastels treatice as i coulde get
yf there be any more which may come to my handes
i shall do my diligence to disclose his disceyte so that god geue me leue to kepe the courte with him he shal wynne but lyttel
except he conueye his balles more craftly
and yet the truth to saye we playe not on euen hande
for i am in a maner as a man bounde to a poste
&amp; can not so wel bestowe me in my playe
as yf i were at lybertye
for i maye not haue suche bokes as are necessary for me
neither yet penne
ynke
paper
but onlye secretlye
so that i am in continual feare
bothe of the leuetenante &amp; of my keper
leste they shulde espye any such thynge by me
&amp; therfore it is lyttel meruel though the worke be on ꝑfeyte
for when soeuer i here the keyes ringe at the dore
strayte al muste be conueyed out of the waye
and then yf any notable thinge hadd bene in my minde
it was cleane lost
&amp; therfore i beseche the good reader counte it as a thynge borne out of ceason
whiche for many causes can not haue his forme &amp; shape
&amp; perdone me my rudenes &amp; imperfection

the friers chronicle

with all her other well-deseruing vertves
right honorable
although such ladies as your selfe
are either compared to rich caskets
containing within them more richer iewels
or resembled to precious diamonds
made the more glorious by enameling
and the cunning of the workman
yet , i protest
beeing an eye-witnesse of your constant resort vnto wisedomes feast
and apprehensiue
that you loue religion meerely for gods loue
that alone hath incited mee to select you the patronesse of this discourse
whereby
i make no doubt
you shall not onely runne with zacheus to the top of a figge-tree to behold iesvs
but bee glad in your very soule
that your foot-steps are fixed in the way of saluation
and that you are now going on in the path
that will conduct you to new ierusalem
the worke it selfe is the discouery of the vnswept corners of popish monasteries
the instrument wherewith it is done
though it bee not the prophets lanterne and candle to search the great citie
yet it is the opening of a booke
wherein you may reade such loathsome particulars against papistry
that in your friends behalfe
you will doe
as wee were wont to doe in england
euen spit at the naming of the diuell
and in your owne
lift vp your hands to heauen with thanksgiuing
that god hath blessed you with a better knowledge
the author
is i confesse
no diuine
but a penitent sinner
and one that would faine striue to be a doore-keeper in the house of god
who hath taken this mercy vpon him
to welcome him home with better acates
then to feed with the hogges at the troughs
my name you shall sure finde at the last
which if it carry an vnpleasant accent
oh bee thus honourable
to admit of one good qualitie
as the mirrour of his time sir philip sidney was wont to say
for a great many haue none
and no man hath all
your honors humbly deuoted
the friers chronicle or the trve legend of priests and monkes lives
i make no question
but that true and wel written discourse of the anatomie of the english nunnery at lisbone in portugall
hath not onely had a gracious acceptation with you
but wrought vpon your iudgements and vnderstanding
as farre as the abhorring their impieties
and lamenting the seduction of silly ignorants
who i dare affirme
being brought out into the sunnie splendour of truth and discouerie
would either wonder
where and how they haue been so long detained in darknesse
or make sport at such ridiculous absurdities
as they haue beene befooled withall
but because there remaines much more to be spoken out of other relations
and vndeniable verity
to make the pride of babel loathsome to true christian soules
and the impieties of that man of sinne abhorred of all iudicious and vnderstanding men
i haue heere vnder-taken further searches for the good of all true-hearted protestants indeed
and although i haue no such portion allotted
as with the prophets lanterne and candle to search the vnswept corners of ierusalem
or with christs rodde of cords to whip the buyers and sellers out of the temple
yet i hope i shall haue strength enough to wrastle downe the strumpet
and lay her flat on her back to the hissing of the passengers
for all the painting of iezabel
and adorning of her head to seeme more maiesticall to iehu
she was yet at the last thrown out of the window
and dashed against the ground
so shall babylon that great citie beserued
in the end shee shall be set on fire
and the merchants of the earth shall howle at her desolation
amazed afarre off at her falling to rubbish
and beholding her smoake to ascend
like the smoake of a furnace
wherein that you may see the reason of gods indignation
and whereby you may intertaine certaine motiues for your owne conuersion
or establishment
i haue heere taken vpon me to discouer
how the popish clergie left and forsooke the pure waters of siloa
to drinke the puddled streames of traditions and filthinesse
scorned to quench their thirst
and buy milke and food without money
but would needs with simon magus pay deare for spirituall gifts
and in a word
denied to come to wisedomes feast
because they would runne a whoring after their owne inuentions
and feed their sensuall carkases with the banquet and acates of their owne desires
and deuising
at first i determined no method
or diuision
supposing that the spredding of instances &amp; examples would haue afforded sufficient contentment to the reader for the subiect in hand
which is the detection of sundry foule abuses in popery
or if you will
in the liues of priests and friers
but finding the streame to come downe with a maine current
and that the stopping or damming it vp too close
would ouer-flow the fields
and spoile much good ground
i thought it better to cut out certaine riuolets
and passages
wherein the riuer might runne betweene bounded bankes
and so the lookers on receiue both pleasure and profit in the handsome keeping their channels
for which purpose if you runne about the streame
you shall finde out certaine deceitfull nookes
holes
creekes
and dangerous flats or shelues
first
of lying miracles
secondly
coozening deuices

simony
of all which in order
or as orderly as i can
not that i place them in their seates of precedencie
or tye them to any coherence of depending one vpon another
but to shew you with what palpable grosenesse they proceeded to ouerthrow true religion
and iustified themselues in the world
to countenance their wickednesse
though they were neuer so foule delinquents
i leaue to dispute of their doctrines
schoole-questions
fundamentall controuersies
church-ceremonies
the popes supremacie
and many other tedious disceptations
which haue clogged vs with heauy burthens
and filled libraries with thousands of volumes
and onely at this time with elias gather vp my cloathes for a cursorie iourney
and take my staffe in my hand
to goe the more speedier forward
and as i confesse
i must passe ouer much ground vnseene
and vnmarked
so i beseech you
gentle reader
censure mee in the same manner
and excuse my not fully satisfying of you
by reason of the hastinesse of my iourney
and the small time i allot my selfe for the dispatch of my businesse
onely herein i dare be confident
there is not a step i make
but i haue warrant for my footing
nor story i relate
but is extracted out of the bookes of their owne magazines
and authoritie of their former writers
and so i conclude this preface with the poet
the daughter of wonder
i will bee bold to say
hee that writ their golden legend
was the father of lyes
but because there are so many bookes
and so many discoueries concerning their ridiculous stories
insomuch that the papists themselues haue been ashamed of such palpable grosenesse
and ridiculous absurditie
i will insist the lesser on this point
and so leaue you to the liues of their saints

because they are not common

as i take it
incerted in their legend
but alledged by substantiall authors
to countenance the religion
but for these
and the whole catalogue of the rest in their notorious fables
you shall finde
that one of the grieuances of germany
when the emperour condiscended to the reformation of religion
was
that the friers seduced them with lyes
and wrought vpon the weakenesse of ignorant men
and superstitious women
concerning coozening deuices
are not yet men liuing
coozening deuices
that can remember the knauerie of priests to make the roodes and images of the churches in england in the dayes of queene mary
to goggle with their eyes
and shake their hands
yea
with wiers to bend the whole body
and many times to speake as they doe in puppet playes
and all to get money
and deceiue the ignorant people
was not a priest punished in the latter end of henry the 8
for pricking his finger
and be-bleeding the corporas

&amp; that there was a very child seen in the singing cake
were not all our tales of fairies
goblins
robingood-fellow
walking spirits
the knaueries of priers and priests
who for belly-cheere
and wanton wenches
came to houses by night
and swept the roomes
yea
gossiped with the crafty lasciuious houswiues
is not the tale of saint bernard worth the reciting
that comming into a church to performe his deuotion
perceiued how knauishly the priests had dealt with the image of our lady
to bid him good morrow
bernard
whereupon to exprobrate their folly
and craftie conueyance
hee answered the image in this sporting manner
peace
madam
it is not lawfull for women to speake in the church
at strasborough a certaine superstitious old woman resorted much to our lady with sufficient offertories
which when the priests perceiued
to countenance her deuotion
they caused the child to speake &amp; thanke her in our ladies armes
which made the woman looke strangely
and speake some-what angerly
for shee presently replyed
peace yong gentleman
i haue nothing to doe with you
let mee heare what my good lady your mother sayes
a taylor of florence
worshipping saint iohn in the church of saint michael barteldi
kneeling downe
beganne in this manner
o glorious and blessed saint iohn
tell me
i pray thee
whether my wife haue played false
and what shall become of my sonne
which the priests and clarke hearing
lying in wait for such purposes
either to make sport
or to raise a further profit
made saint iohn thus reply
my deare sonne
goe in peace
and to morrow thou shalt receiue an answere
the taylor
i hope
mist not his houre
nor forgot his offertorie
so he made his petition
&amp; the image answered
thy wife hath made thee cuckold
and thy son shall be hang &apos;d
at which the fellow was so amazed
that he went home enraged
and wanted little of desperately making away himselfe through the villany of the priests
this tale did piero de cosmo de medici
relate himselfe to diuers of his guests
a priest of louaine
called anthony
hauing solemnly inuited some merry companions to dinner
knew not yet which way to intertaine them
for he had neither meat nor money
at last stepping into a neighbours house
where he was very frequent
and finding the seruant absent
he took the pot from the fire
and carried it home vnder his gowne
thus he not only supplyed his wants
but powring out the meat into some other dish
sent the pot handsomely made cleane
as a pawne to the owner
and borrowed money of it
hauing a bill of sale for the receit
the good man in the meane while chasing and fretting for the losse of his dinner
and theft of his pot
knew not what to say
till the maid assured him
there was none there but sir anthony
hee againe loth to accuse so reuerent a man
and indeed affraid of the danger
was more vexed then before
till the seruant looking on the pawne
told him
it was his owne pot
then out of all patience he accused the priest before a magistrate
but when sir anthony shewed the bill of sale
it was turnd to a merriment
and so the theft was shuffled ouer
the iacobinas of berne
and franciscans of orleance got most of their wealth by walking spirits
and resorting by night to houses
as if robin good-fellow had done the drudgerie to ease the seruants of their labour
frier reynald of siena
louing a mans wife
and so resorting to the house
was ouer-taken on a sudden with the vnlookt for comming home of her husband
and had scarce time to leape out of the bed
and carry his cloathes in his hand
the man knocking still
and the wife making no great haste
some hurly-burly arose
where-vpon
the woman layes the child in the friers place
and lets in her husband
who angerly demanded
why she tarried so long
oh replyed shee
speaking so lowd
the frier might heare her
our sonne had like to haue perished through a fit of the collicke
so that i was fayne to send for frier reynald to pray for him
who bade me keepe him warme in the bed
and is himselfe with his sexton at his deuotion in the loft
with that
the frier and his companion came downe with a booke in his hand
and after solemne courtsey made
told the good man
the child had certain worms in his maw
and therefore hee must make a statuae of wax of his bignesse
and present it to saint ambrose
the curat of ouziane
neere to amboise
hauing long had the pleasure of his hostesse
and bred a great deale of iealousie in her husband
thought by a crafty tricke to remoue that humour
pretending to be gelt
wherevpon hee agrees with one peier de serpens
borne at villantroies in berry
for foure crownes to sport with him
and conceale the matter
which when the host vnderstood
hee promiseth him twice as much to performe the thing indeed
the surgeon taking pitie of the man
and despighted at the friers knauerie
bound him hand and foote
and while he looked the company should make intercession for him
and so leaue him to his former libertie
the other whipt off his stones
telling him plainely
his profession was no dallying profession
and so the host seemed quieted
as being thus reuenged
a woman in orleans being in loue with a yong scholler
who yet was not acquainted with her
knew no better way to discouer her affection
then by her frier confessor
desiring him to giue him good counsell
not to tempt her
nor sollicit her any more
especially not to come ouer the wall into her orchard as he promised
the frier ouer-taken with her simplicitie
aduised the yong man for the best
and to diuert his loue from her
the yong man againe knowing there was no such matter
and yet apprehensiue of a womans wit
admitted of his good instruction
but instructed himselfe how he nowmight enioy a sweet-heart
but when the frier vnderstood how he had been made a bawd and pandar for the businesse
hee thought to beat out one nayle with another
and so very knauishly threatned the discouerie
if hee might not share in the bargaine
it is reported of oliuer mailard
that when hee saw the wickednesse and villany of priests and friers
he wondred
that the saints interred in the church
did not rise and pull out the eyes of the whore-masters
and deceiuers
pontanus saith
that there were certaine nunneries at valencia
which by reason of the filthinesse of friers
who played the very bawdes and pandars to get mony
became loathsome stewes
and intertained yong gentlemen
as in brothell houses
but all vnder colour of deuotion
when any of the priests knauerie was discouered
there were excuses enough ready to desend them
yea
when they were found kissing of a woman
the answer was
you must suppose he did it to print a blessing on her lips
what should i name the great abuses of induigences
and pardons
and all for money
wherein there were many tricks
and counterfet deuices
certaine cheating friers hauing pawned their relicks in a tauerne
and wanting money to redeeme them
shewed the people a firebrand
and made them beleeue it was part of the fire
which broyled saint lawrence
wherevpon according to the ignorance of those times
many gaue them money
which they spent in all vnthriftinesse
a lady sent to pleasure a yong cardinall
according to a certaine composition betweene him and her husband
seemed at first very coy
and for all the basenesse of her husband
would by no meanes consent to his pleasure
till at last
by forcible perswasions
faire intreatie
extraordinarie promises
the handsomnesse of his person
and the greatnesse of his estate
shee condiscended vnto him
and seemed well pleased in the alteration
where-vpon shee returnes to her husband with the money
and told him plainely
shee was bought and sold
and therfore would returne
and forsake him for euer
and thus much of their coozening and deuices
wherein i pray you take onely this notice
that i meane to giue you but a taste of euery one of the diuisions
for if i should set a banquet before you
or a feast to feed you
you would rather surfet
then be satisfied
the dishes are so many wherewith i could furnish the table
and of that varietie
that you might rather glut and gorge your selues
then content nature with a temperate dyet
againe
whereas it may be obiected
these were the times of old
there is now great reformation since these enormities were looked into
i answere plainely and directly
the same superstition remaines at this houre
and the priests doe so preuaile with coozening deceit
and farre-fetcht deuices
that in spaine this present yeere 1622
the doctrine of the conception of our lady without sinne
and assumption into heauen
is newly divulged and ratified
and the contrary opinion reputed heresie
and the repugners hunted
and hissed at in euery towne and citie
concerning their whoredome
or if you will haue the cleanlier terme
fornication
who knowes not
that there is a common allowance of stewes
more then a conueniencie
vnder all the catholike gouernment
for which the women doe allow an annuall entrado into the popes exchequer
or to the seuerall states where they liue
in the first councell of toledo
in the raigne of arcadius and honorius
it was agreed
that the clergie liuing without wiues
should haue concubines
in the patents of abbots
in the realme of england
this clause was incerted
in those dayes it was counted good policy to haue a wife
daughter or neece
a companion of a cardinall
or bishop
to be-friend the kinred in matters of complaint
or in tryals of law
a gentle-woman taken in adulterie
and so diuorced
desired for her penance to be detruded into a monasterie
alledging this reason to her inward friends
that in stead of punishment
shee should bee sure to haue there the greater pleasure
when souldiers entred into any towne to be lodged
or quartered
the first thing they did
was to hunt after priests lemans
and search euery corner for their whores
and thus much for the generall
now to particulars
a franciscan frier lodging in the house of a gentleman of perigot
found the meanes to lye with his wife vpon her purification
as vnderstanding by confession his resolution
so hee entred the chamber first
and when hee had taken his pleasure
departed out of the house
excusing his haste to the porter
by speciall businesse
after he was departed
comes the gentleman indeed
and found by his wiues speech
that some body had wronged him
which so amazed him
that he amazed her by saying
he was abused
shee with teares assured him
that none was in the house but the frier
and her brother
which was no sooner spoken
but vp hee gets
and to the porter hee comes
and there vnderstands
how the frier was departed
after him he followes
but not ouertaking him
hee returnes home againe
in his absence
the wife enraged to bee so deflowred
hangs her selfe
and in the mischance ouerthrew a little child dead to the ground
the noise rais &apos;d the house
and at last comes the brother
and finding his sister hangd
supposing her husband had done it
in some fit of iealousie
out of doores he flings
and meetes him returning home
in which moode hee sets vpon him with villaine
and defiance
and so they wound one another to death
the franciscans of strasborough
before they were expelled
accustomed to steale away mens wiues
and keepe them cloystered like yong nouices
cutting their hayre
and charming them with feare of death
till at last a butchers wife was sent in the same habit with the cater to buy meate of her husband
who eying her very narrowly
as hauing seene the face before
could not be restrained
but layd hands vpon her
and so after great adoe
all was discouered
&amp; the friers banished
two franciscans hauing no money to pay the ferry
rauished the woman that carried them
and so pleased her
a franciscan in perigot found the meane
by obscuring himselfe in the bride-chamber
to lye with a bride
before her husband came to her
and escaped
for all that the houshold could doe
when they heard of it
another franciscan by lyons
married his brother frier
in the habit of a scholler
to a widdowes daughter of great riches and account
making them beleeue
hee was an heire to great reuenues
and sent to lyons
as it were vnder his tutelage
but at last the mother and daughter comming to heare masse
as much deuoted to this order
espied her husband answering the priest in his friers weed
which for the time they concealed
till they came home
and at night
as his custome was
he likewise kept his houres
but being in bed
the mother comes in
and layed hold of his hands
while his daughter pull &apos;d off his cap
and discouered her shauen crowne
and so hee was apprehended
and sent to the magistrate
there are more stories of the franciscans
then of any other order
&amp; they were euermore played vpon
because they pretended more holines
and sanctitie of life
they builded their houses and cels very neere the nunneries
insomuch that many merrily said
heere were the barnes
it is reported
that when henry the second was king of france
and wanted a great summe of money
a certaine lord wisht him to sell the friers beds
and when the king demanded
where they then should lye
he presently replyde
with the nunnes
but
quoth the king
there are more monkes a great deale then nunnes
why
said the other
one nunne may very well haue fiue or sixe monkes
two or three curats betweene daulphine and sauoy
perswaded the women to faine themselues mad
that while their husbands went on pilgrimage to recouer their health
the priests might come and lye with them
a frier minorite of sicilia
falling in loue with the young wife of old agatha the physician
taught her a tricke to faine her selfe pained with the disease of the mother
for which the frier must be sent for
and bring in the relikes of saint bernardine
which hee did
commanding all the company in the chamber to auoid
and so hee went to bed to the physicians wife
while his companion lay with the maid
but ere all was done
home comes the old man
and found the friers breeches vnder his wiues pillow
which she confessed
as a part of the relicks
there to remaine
for feare of a relapse
whereupon the maid went to the friers
to tell what had chanced
who came downe merrily with all the other ceremonies of the cure
and so put his breeches together with the other reliques
the old tale of the abbesse in lombardy is remembred to this day
who hearing that one of her nunnes was in labour
came in all haste to chide her
but belike shee was puzzled in the darke
for in stead of her vaile
she had put on a monkes breeches
that lay with her the same night
so comming to the nunne
shee began to reuile her
who for all her paine
soberly answered
good madam mend your plaister
and all shall bee well inough
i warrant you
this tale is seconded by many other stories in mine author
pogius the florentine reports of an hermite at padoa
in the time of francis the
duke who was accused for intising the yong and handsome women to his lust and pleasure
wherevpon the dukes secretarie was very busie to examine him
hoping hee would name some
at whose husbands hee might make sport
and laughter
in which iollitie
hee vrgeth him againe and againe to set down the women
why then
quoth the hermite
and you bee so hastie
write downe your owne wife first
i hope you may imagine hee was amazed
the duke smiled
and the whole company stood silent
for feare their turne should be next
a priest at paris
after shrift went no further then the pew he sate in
to satisfie his lust
a curate neere vienne in daulphine
went behinde the high altar
a woman taken in adulterie with a priest
was accused and examined
but because shee could not deny the fact
the priest was brought before the bishop
who prescribed him this penance
not to come in three months within a church
when the man
who was thus abused
vnderstood of so small a punishment
he lies in wait for him
and cruelly beates him
so that hee is brought before his iudge to receiue punishment
who awarded him not to come into a tauern in 3
moneths
at which the bishop seemed much offended
till the iudge answered
my lord
considering the first abuse
i hope it is as great a punishment for him not to visit a tauerne
as penance for the priest not to trouble a church
in a village neere corguac
called cherues
a maid was got with child by her owne brother
which she discouered to a priest
and he perswaded the people impragnatam à spiritu
but when so great an imposture came to the eares of the earle of angolesme
father to francis the first
he quickly found out the deceit
and so they were both burnt
and the priest suspended
to conclude this section
i will be bold with the records of the time of henry the eight in our owne countrey
concerning the visitation of monasteries
couents
collegiat churches
and other religious houses
out of which these particulars are extracted
that in the monasterie of battell
or bete
in the diocesse of chichester
these so domites were discouered
and iohn austine
in the church of canterbury among the monks of saint bennet
all these were found sodomites
and punished accordingly
to name other places
and other commissions of whoredome and fornication
were infinit
but so it was
and will be in all nations
where impuritie and superstition ouercomes true zeale and deuotion
yet because there were certaine religious men that did obserue state in their impiety
and thought scorne to goe to common brothels
or prostituted whores
but kept women by the name of sequestration
and so liued more glorious
then the rest of poorer priests
i will also name you some of them
as among the monkes of saint bennet
christopher iames had the command and vse of three married women
william
abbot of bristow had foure whores
in windsor castle
nich
whyden
priest
had but foure
george witborne had fiue
richard hunn fiue
robert danison
sixe
richard prior of maiden-bedly
fiue
in the monasterie of shulberd
in the diocesse of chichester
george walden
prior
had seuen
iohn standney
seuen
nicholas duke
fiue
in the monasterie of bath
richard lincombe had seuen
in the cathedrall church of chichester
iohn hill had onely thirteene
iohn white prior of bermonsdy had twenty
now if there were foure hundred couents of monkes
and nunnes
and two hundred of begging friers
and a suruey taken of all the delinquents in this kinde
o iudge
for gods sake iudge
how many whores
and bastards of priests
and friers might bee in england in those dayes
and then
if according to the poet
wee could step into france
italy
spaine
germany
and other countries
where the clergy bare the sway
and gaue the example
and so pull out the dust and rubbish of their vnswept corners
oh what a deale of filth
and a dunghill of noysomenesse
would arise
and what a mountaine of sinne would this sinne make
as for the distinction of time
i will be bold to say
it is as ill now
as euer it was in any time
finde fault with the priests
not onely for their hypocrisie
but their filthy and incontinent liues
giuen to gluttony and belly-cheere
which hee setteth out by the termes of drunkennes and vomiting
i hope
the monkes and friers of europe come behinde none of them all
oh looke
for gods sake
looke
and you shall finde in the booke of god
many inuectiues against corrupt priests
couetous priests
winking priests
negligent priests
obstinate priests
idolatrous priests
rebellious priests
indifferent priests
gluttonous priests
blind priests
ignorant priests
dumbe priests
courtly priests
idle &amp; vnconstant priests
bribed priests
hypocriticall priests
diuellish priests
deuouring priests
raging priests
incredulous priests
flattering priests
bloudy priests
murchering priests
luke-warme priests
madde priests
oh looke for gods sake
looke
and you shall finde in the cloisters of monasteries
in the cels of abbeys
in the walkes of religious places
in the courts of princes
in the castles of lords
in the houses of gentlemen
in the streets of cities
in the farmes of countreymen
and in the chambers of widdowes
religious men of all these sorts
especially hunting after belly-cheere
and to fill their veines with fulnesse of blood
hot
and corrupted
marke but the situation of their monasteries and houses
are they not in the fattest grounds
and the plentiful fields of the country
doe they not feed on the choisest lambes of the fold
and stretch out their limmes on beds of iuory
doe they not carowse in gobblets and chalices of gold
and haue the purest wines of the vintage
with what delicate fruits are their orchards stored
and with what walkes of pleasure are their gardens contriued
was it not a by-word in those dayes
a chuffing abbot
a fiery-faced abbot
a gorbellied abbot
is there not at this houre bread made at paris of the finest wheat
called the chapter bread
doe they not euery where feed on the daintiest manchet
yea
those they call mendicant friers
eceiue no scraps
i hope
but whole loaues
and the best prouision in an house
are not their caters sent to the markets to prouide the best meat
both flesh
fish
&amp; fowle
pikes of fiue french crownes
carps
tenches
barbels
and all of that sort at high rates
and must they not be sod and stewed in wine
to please the palate
and heat the stomake
are not their fasting dayes
dayes of banquets
sweet-meates
and confectionary stuffe
cullises and broths
cawdles
and panados
sweet and hot waters
perfumes and incense
are not their linnen of the best diaper and damaske
and the vtensels of their house so farre from temperature
and moderation
that they exceed in sumptuousnesse
and brauerie
there was a certaine cardinall in rome
that
to make demonstration of humilitie
had alwaies a net for his table-cloth
but preferred to the papacy
he bade take away the net
for he had that which he fish &apos;d for
when english cromwell had a great suite to clement the pope
he acquainted himselfe with his custome
and dyet
and so inuented a dish of sauoury and pleasant gelly
which he brought in
in a fantasticall manner
with a true mans song
a thing much in vse in those dayes
and so whether his holinesse were pleased with the sport
or delighted with the dainty
hee granted his request
pope iulius accustomed to eate porke and peacocks flesh
would make long meales
and was a meere glutton
becket himselfe was accused for an hereticke
as eating capons on saint markes day
and feeding like an epicure on prohibited times
so that he should haue beene attached
had not the holy man miraculously turn &apos;d a capon to a carpe
in the legend of cardinall wolsey
it is obiected against him
that he ate stewed capons in lent
and sate at his feasts as long as the king himselfe
i could name the rest
or at least many more
but these
i hope
shall suffice for the subiect in hand
and if any haue forgot the vsance of their owne countrey
let them still demaund of the trauellers in other places
who haue frequented the monasteries of europe
and i hope they will confesse the truth without blushing
thefts and robberies
but the exhausting of the treasure of a whole kingdome
insomuch
that for such theeuish exaction
luther and others rowled a stone
which neuer lest
till it turned the popes supremacie out of most countries of europe
was not the imposition of peter-pence in england
amounting to the yeerely rent of a 100000
pound sterling
a meere theft
did not women goe about
as they doe still in ireland
with a cozening priest
to howle ouer the graues of the dead
and mourne for the desunct
teaching their eyes to weepe
and their hearts to sob
and all for money
are not the priests stil set on worke to incroach vpon the flexible nature of men and women
to perswade them to wilfull pouerty
that they might bee inriched with their gifts and legacies
and haue their monasteries augmented with their lands and reuenues
were not the iesuites banished venice
for cozening the ladies and gentlewomen of their collanas
and iewels
some of them worth two thousand pound sterling
being of great orientall pearle
and other rich precious stones
what an infinit treasure did cardinall wolsey conuey out of this realme
for the ransom of pope clement
and briberie of the cardinals for his owne aduancement to the papacie
and maintaining his ambition
is not that ridiculous tale worth the reciting
of the man that buried his dogge
for which hee was accused
and brought before the bishop
which he answered in this manner
o my lord
if you knew the wisedome of this dogge
you would not condemne mee
for at his death hee bequeathed a legacy to your lordship of a hundred crownes
knowing your wants
and great occasions
by which excuse he was remitted
and the bishop pacified
but was not this either manifest atheisme
or plaine robbery
was and is not the croysade a tricke of theeuerie
to make men beleeue
they must pay so much money
or be damned
did not a ghostly father preach in the open pulpit
that when any money was giuen for a soule departed
the soules in purgatory hearing it tingle in the bason
did laugh for ioy
was not this the very cause
that christ did exprobate the pharises for buying and selling in the temple
saying plainely
this should bee a house of prayer
but ye haue made it a den of theeues
at casall one finding three hundred crownes
confessed the same to a priest
who so terrified him with damnation
if it were not restored
that the silly fellow deliuered him the money to impart it backe againe to the owner
as he by coniuration would finde out
but hee deceiued him
and spent the same amongst whores
and pot-companions
a curtizan in venice lying very sicke
sent for a frier to confesse her sinnes
and so opening a casket
in which was our ladies psalter bound in gold
the frier peeping in
saw beside a 1000 zhekinos lying by
for the time he said little
but afterward found a better time to purloyne the same away
was not the hermit of the valley of monte negro a iolly fellow
who with two friers kept the passages in strange habits
and robbed all commers
did not certaine priests frequent the schollers lodgings at sienna
and still as their exhibition came from their parents
they would either steale some
or be the cause of vnnecessary expences
and when money failed
they would either haue bookes
or apparell
at the garden of simples in padoa
a gentleman of poland hauing a rich hat-band
was deceiued of it by a frier
that came and lay by him
as hee was searching the ground for some new hearbe to shew the master
i could name you a thousand of these stories
both to proue their generall and particular thefts
some serious
some ridiculous
some indifferent
but these shall suffice at this instant
and i make no question
there is no reader
or searcher of inuentories
but lights vpon many more
and although some with licurgus law allow of theft
to make men the more wary and cautelous of their goods
and other-some excuse them
as men subiect to imperfections
or politicke husbands
that may increase their estates by thriuing deuices
yet the true-hearted christian wil confesse such theeueries
the branches of impietie
and if they condemne them in other men
will much more abhorre them in the professors of religion
and priests of the clergie
concerning their murthers
and cruell and bloudy practises
either to compasse their owne 6
murther
and bloudy cruelty
ends
or take reuenge of such as had offended them
i am thus fraighted with many stories
but before i come to particulars
giue mee leaue to tell you
i could discouer many horrible and fearefull executions
many notorious and formidable massacres
many grieuous and sanguinarious persecutions
i could tell you
that the priests perswaded silly women
that abortion was no sinne
i could also adde
that in the gardens of nunneries
was alwayes a tree or two of sauine
which they say the nunnes vsed to drinke steeped in wine
now the property of sauine is to destroy any thing condensed in the wombe
and so you may iudge of the cause
and so i come to the rest
in the time of maximilian the emperour
a franciscan frier in flanders
came one night into a gentlemans house
and after he had murthered some seruants
tooke the gentlewoman perforce
and dis-robed her of her apparell
putting a short garment on her
which hee brought with him
of purpose to steale her away to the monastery
and so threatning her with death
if shee spake or discouered the matter
though shee met with her husband
hurried her out of doores
riding with a long pike staffe
and a short dagger disguized
but as he posted away in this manner
hee met with her husband indeed and his man
the gentlewoman
as she was threatned and coniured
passed by
and durst not speake
and so the frier followed as churlishly
the seruant had onely a glimpse of her
and knew her
yea
hee discouered the frier also
telling his master
what had hapned
but he by reason of the impossibilitie of the matter
as hee supposed
told him hee was a foole
or mad
and so would haue rid home without any more adoe
but the seruant would needs goe backe againe to take his better view
which when the frier perceiued
and apprehensiue
that his knauerie should be reuealed
he took the aduantage of the mans peering vnder her vaile
&amp; so with a violent stroke
feld him to the ground with his braines dasht out
the gentleman seeing his man fall
returned in fury
and had the fortune to cloze with the frier
and so struggling together
at last ouerthrew him
which when his wife perceiued
she returned and assisted him
wounding the frier with his owne dagger
thus was he taken
and afterward examined
and adiudged to dye
and so hee was publikely burnt
the lord saint iohn of ligoures
cousin to the marshall of saint andrewes
committed incest with his wiues mother
and had diuers children by her
yea
hee so loued her
or if you will
burned in lust toward her
that he reuealed the same in confession to his ghostly father
who to pleasure the lord
told him plainely he might kill his wife
and so bee rid of her
this was dangerous and bloudy
and therevpon hee made a stay
till the frier andaciously told him
he would be the executioner for his sake
and so the murther was committed by certaine ruffians
but at last detected
for which the frier was publikely executed
a priest of fonsigney
called don iohn
vnder the dominion of thiez
then gouernour of geneua
out of meere malice and heart-burning
boted out his brothers eyes
not so contented
hee brought him to chambery
to a saint called saint iuery
and then in great request
and as hee was passing ouer a bridge
would haue throwne him into the riuer
but missing of his purpose
by accesse of greater company
hee with certaine as wicked as himselfe
kill &apos;d him in a barne
a priest called saint iohn
came to autuns church in paris
to visit the curate of saint andrew des ars
who stood betweene him
and a benefice
but not willing to tarry the time
and growing enraged to be so long disappointed
hee tooke an opportunitie
and set vpon him and his man
and with his companions kill &apos;d them both
for which he was afterward executed
in an inne at soysons
the good mans daughter of the house had a child vnlawfully
which was brought vp in the house to his great griefe
and therefore he could neuer endure it
because it still put him in minde of her shame
at last hee contriued to put her to a nunnery with a certaine piece of money
and so hee bargained with a priest called hector
a bakers sonne of moyen
but this varlet tooke the child
and without any more adoe cut her throat
throwing the body into a heape of nettles
but see the goodnesse of god hard by
was a sexton making a graue in a churchyard
to whom he proffered money to bury the body
but he suspitious of the murther
reuealed all he knew to the magistrate
and so the parties were examined
and the murther found out
a priest of orleans iealous of a whore which he kept
and loth to bee further tormented
carried her to a tauerne
vnder colour of kindnesse
and there beginning cause of displeasure
at last cut her throat
the duke of brabant
and earle of gelderland
raised warre for the duke-dome of limbourg
in which the bishop of cullen as assistant to the earle
was taken prisoner
and kept seuen yeere
till all conditions were accomplished
thus was he in the custody of the earle of mount in heinalt
whom hee could not corrupt for his escape with any promise or gifts
which so inraged him
that in his heart he sware reuenge
at last hee is set at liberty
and all vnkindnesse seemed to bee forgotten
insomuch that the bishop came to visit the duke
&amp; in his returne intreated the earle to accompany him to tuits
a towne standing ouer against cullen
which he did
suspecting no harme
but the bishop had liued in ambuscado for him
and not onely imprisoned him
but euery hot day vsed him in this maner
he script him naked
and most cruelly put him into an iron cage
all nointed ouer with honey
and so set him in the sunne
where flyes
hornets
wasps
and bees
tormented the poore earle to death
two canons of cullen vpon displeasure against herman grin
and yet dissembling their malice
inuited him to dinner
and in stead of friendly fare
thrust him into a roome
where was kept a hungry lyon
but the valiant man winding his cloake about his arme
drew his rapier
&amp; kill &apos;d the beast
and so scaped the reuenge of these wicked priests
henry
archbishop of cullen
most cruelly and barbarously brake the armes and legges of earle frederick
and when hee had done
cast the carkasse to the crowes
in the time of otho the emperour
there was a cruell bishop of mentz
who hated the poore
and said they were worse then vermine
and rats
and fit for nothing but to bee burnt
wherevpon in a time of dearth hee filled a barne full of them
and set it on fire
consuming them to cynders
for which
the iudgement of god fell vpon him
and he was deuoured of rats aliue
for when he fled from all places
they following him in great multitudes
he went into a tower in the midst of the rhine
called the rats-tower for euer after
whither the rats swamme after him
but it lay not in the strength or policy of man to deliuer him
for there they deuoured him aliue
a iacobine poisoned henry the 7
emperour
with his breaden god
iohn de roma
a iacobine frier
one of the holy house of spaine
so persecuted the christians of merindol and gabriere
that hee filled bootes with hot grease
and drew them on their legges
both to draw them to confession
and make them confesse where their money was
a monke called heran
presuming of his merits
by reason of his holinesse
and austeritie of life
after fifty yeeres was perswaded by the diuell to throw himselfe into a deepe well
from whence preserued and taken out by miracle
hee could not bee perswaded
or remoued from any other opinion
but that it was an angell appeared vnto him
to make him glorious to posteritie
philip the emperour
and his successor otho
were both brought to their destruction by the practises of innocent the third
and why may not i bring in heere
that king iohn of england was poisoned by a monke of swinsted abbey
seeing they themselues bring it in
and insert it in their stories
about the yeere 1513
henry of lutzenburg was poisoned in the sacrament by a dominican frier
which baptista ignatius affirmes
and sleidan recites the reason
from a motiue of clement the fift
because hee grew too strong in italy
but what followed
many friers of that order were slaine afterwards by the souldiers
pope innocent the fourth was charged with the poisoning of frederick the emperour
by meanes of peter de vinca
but escaping at that time
hee was afterward murthered by manfrede
by the same popes practise
ioane queene of naples was murthered by the priuity and consent of vrbane the sixt
charles king of naples
by the nefarious and bloudy counsell of clement the fourth
caused conradinus and frederick duke of austria to be put to death
which at last cost the young prince his life
and
so murther vpon murther followed
and the popes themselues were defamed for such hatefull mischiefe and treasons
sixtus the fourth
was the principall contriuer of that treason
whereby iulian de medices was slaine
and his brother laurence hurt in the church of reparata at florence
at the eleuation of the sacrament
for volateran saith
that the pope knew of it
and countenanced the malefactors
alexander the sixt most inhumanely caused gemes the turkes brother to be impoysoned
being seduced and corrupted by the bribes of the great turke
and promises of more money
henry the third of france was most shamefully murthered by a dominican frier
called iames clement
and the fact not onely allowed of at rome
but highly commended by the pope
the lamentable story of that man of men henry the fourth of france
is not yet forgotten
and whensoeuer it pleaseth god to spred abroad the carpet of reuenge
oh what foule soules peraduenture will appeare vnder faire faces
the late prince of orange was first wounded by iohn iauregui
and afterward murthered by baltasar gerard
being both perswaded by masse-priests and friers
that such a facinorous act must needs be meritorious
i could also name michael reinion
peter de four
and peter pann
animated to kill prince maurice
all instructed by priests and iesuites
who are indeed the very incendiaries of the popes furnace
to set all europe in combustion
what should i trouble you further with their owne murthering one another for the papacy
with the cruelties of the consistorian cardinals
and the exorbitant wickednesse
which streameth all ouer the citie
and is more infectious to their soules
then the plague
which often happens in that place
to their bodies
concerning their blasphemies
i meane not to trouble you much with their oathes
strange inuented 7
their blasphemies
oathes
forswearings
protestations
execrations
curses
equiuocations
or such like
for i haue other things to make you amazed withall
and such fearefull speeches hammered on the anuill of the diuels shoppe
that i must needs say with the poet
horresco referens
yet i will begin gently
and tell you
it was a prouerb
a common prouerbe in those times
hee sweareth like an abbot
a certaine priest at rome
who had been angred by a curtezan
burst out into an oath
and sware by potta de la virgine
when the monkes had no wine
they vs &apos;d to send to their brethren
and say
date nobis de oleo vestro
quia lampades nostra extinguuntur
a certaine frier preaching of the passion of christ
acted his gesture in such a maner
that hee moued his auditorie to shed teares
which when he perceiued
he changed the accent of his voice
and cryed out
weep not so greatly
for perhaps it is not true
which i told you
a wicked priest of toures
rayling on the hugonets
for putting their trust in christ
durst aduenture to tell them
that for his part hee would beleeue the pope before christ
iulius the third
called iohn de maria de monte
exclaimed thus
that if god was so angry for the eating of an apple
how great reason had he to be raged at the losse of his peacock
which meat he loued so well
cardinall bembus in a conference about their glory and wealth in the world
exclaimed with a smile
oh what riches haue we gotten by this fable of christ
a popish prelate rayling against lutherans
said plainely
that sure saint peter at the first was a lutherane
for out of the presumption of his faith
hee would needs come to christ on the water
and might thereby haue beene drowned
if not saued miraculously
menot a frenchman
and barlet an italian
said
that if christ had not been crucified
the uirgin mary would haue performed it with her owne hands for the saluation of mankinde
the papists in generall confesse perfection in the rules of monkes and friers
and the masse-priests of trent doe make traditions equall to scriptures
and they commonly deny scriptures to be a perfect rule of life and doctrine
the turkes punish feuerely such as blaspheme christ
but papists
i meane
the monkes and friers teare him in pieces with their hands and mouthes
for such are thought to be most cleere of heresie
that can sweare most wickedly
and blaspheme outragiously
though papists professe iesus christ
&amp; c
yet doe they teach that dogs and hogs doe eate his body
as oft as they eate the consecrated host
the pope is called the soueraigne lord of purgatorie
and can deliuer soules from thence by indulgences and pardons
the turkes deny all manner of god-hood in man
yea
in their owne prophet mahomet
and verily beleeue
that cosdras was vanquished by the romanes
for calling himselfe a god
but the popes not onely call themselues so
but haue decreed it hereticall to thinke otherwise
i could loade you with examples
but these shall suffice
for i would not raise this mount too high
considering i determine but a kinde of hillocke
to ouer-looke the neighbour fields
and easie passages
onely i will adde hereunto how god hath been displeased with these men
euen as farre as desperate deaths and punishments
yet neither haue they repented
but dyed in their perfidious blasphemies
nor others taken warning
but continued in their malicious wickednesse
the chancelour of france cried out on his death-bed
oh cardinall
thou hast sent vs all to the diuell
bonanenture de periere
author of that detestable booke
called symbolum mundi
ran himselfe vpon his sword
and dyed most desperately
as razis
and others in switzerland threw themselues headlong from high rocks
by reason of the blasphemies of popes prelates
the chancelor and legat du prat made a faire hospitall
of which francis the first was wont to say
it was not halfe large enough to lodge so many poore people
as he had vndone
hee dyed at nantouillet of a strange disease
his stomake eaten thorow with wormes
and while his coffers were sealing vp
he roued
and said
see
what is gotten with seruing the king with soule and body
stephen ponchier
archbishop of toures
labouring to erect a new court against the professors of true religion
called the burning chamber
was attached by a disease
named le feu de dieu
beginning at his feet
and rising vp to his head
so that hee was constrained to cut off one legge and member after another
till he dyed
iohn ruze a chancelor of parlament
and great blasphemer of god
and persecutor of the protestants
had a burning disease in his priuities and stomake
which consumed him
claudius des asses
a great swearer and blasphemer
the same day hee had condemned a protestant to be burnt
as he was in the act of filthines with one of his chamber-maids
the same day dyed of an apoplexy
oh the lamentable deaths of our owne clergy in england
rauing
and blaspheming god euen at the last gaspe
as they say
namely
the bishop of winchester
cardinall bewford
cardinall wolsey
cardinall poole
gardner
bonner
and diuers others
iohn andrew a stationer
and a spie against protestants
set on by the popish clergy
died starke mad
and railing both against god and them
iohn menier
lord of opidel
fell into a strangurie and burning disease
blaspheming his creator
and crying out against the clergy
a iacobine frier
called de roma
withdrawing himselfe to auignion
determined to make merry with the spoiles of the protestants of prouence
where he was first robbed by his owne seruants
and then died in beggery of a strange disease
petrus castellanus was once a professor of the gospell
in the time of francis the first
and so displeased the sorbonists at paris
afterwards he returned as they say
to the vomit
in the raigne of henry the second
and thereupon was made the bishop of orleance
the reason is rendred
because the protestants had no countenance nor honour
but what followed he fell into a strange disease
the one halfe of his body was as hot as fire
the other as cold as might be
which
ioyned with a bloudy flix
kill &apos;d him at last
but before he died
all were amazed at his sorrow and extremitie

concerning their ignorance and doltishnesse
7
their blasphemies
for the generall
it is well knowne
that many priests could scarce read latine
much lesse vnderstand it
and knew not their masse and mattens
but by the great letters
yea when they were drunke
were often deceiued in the rules of the pye
and would diuers times repeate one for another
insomuch that in england we had these phrases
ignorant sir iohn
a very dunse
a queen maries priest
and such like
but to make you sport
and giue you some examples
it is a common tale of a pretty boy
that set the priests barne on fire
and speaking to him in his owne latine
all was burnt
because he vnderstood him not
pogius the florentine hath a hundred examples of the priests of his time
that knew no latine
when they came to receiue orders
they are called his facetiae
and indeed he sets downe the stories
meerely for iests and laughter
there was an italian frier
that told the people
they were to celebrate that weeke the feast of epiphany
but by his troth he knew not
whether it were man or woman
when a certaine priest read the gospell of christs feeding so many men with a fewe loaues and fishes
he named 500 for 5000
at which the clarke being discontented
stepped to him
and told him he was mistaken
it was 5000
hold thy peace
replied the priest
i pray god they beleeue this number
there was a certaine priest
that supposed dignus
was latine to dine
for when he came to the bishop to be preferred to a benefice
the bishop onely asked him
hee replyed
that if it pleased his lordship
hee would dine with his gentlemen
what should i name him
that could not tell the father of the foure sonnes of aimon
or him
that knew not who begat iaphet
for all they said
that noah had three sonnes
som
ham
and iaphet
there was a priest in italy so absurdly ignorant
that when he came to baptize an infant
he accustomed to say
of diuers priests the relation is thus
a curate of artois suing his parishioners for not pauing the church
alledged the prophet ieremy for his action — paueant illi
&amp; non paueam ego
a profound clerke
being vrged with certaine lawes
called clementina and nouella
was very angry
that they obiected to him the testimonie of whores and harlots
prat the chancelor
interpreting henry the 8
letter to francis the french king
englished
so many mules
in stead of mastiues
hugo carensis wil not haue diabolus
a slanderer
but to eat vp one at two morsels
body and soule
in the conference holden at poyssi
a priest called demochares
pleading for images
was so ignorant
that hee had no other thing to alledge
but the painted windowes of saint denis
true
answered the minister
your argument is made of glasse
the papists commend the colliers faith
that could answere the diuell nothing
but that he beleeued
as the church beleeueth
although hee knew not what that beliefe was
wherevpon linwood and others say
it is sufficient to beleeue the articles of the creed
and no more
dante saith
that the friers preach their owne inuentions
and tell idle tales without edification
and cornelius agrippa condemneth their ignorance
as preaching meere toyes
and humane deuices
as not vnderstanding any other
alfonsus à castro saith
that diuers popes were vtterly vnlearn &apos;d
for one of them
in stead of fiat
said fiatur
gregory the sixt
according to laziardus
vnderstood not the masse
pope zachary condemned virgilius
a bishop of germany
as an hereticke
for saying there were antipodes
and paul the second could not endure the name of academie
as an enemy to all learning
iohn peckam
in the provinciall constitution
thinketh it sufficient for priests once in a quarter of a yeere to expound the articles of the creed
ten commandements
the two commandements of the gospell
the seuen workes of mercy
the seuen deadly sinnes
the seuen vertues
the seuen sacraments
and that without curiositie
durandus teacheth vs
that the two points of a bishops myter
signifieth the old and new testament
but loies mersilius
an augustine frier saith
that the two strops of the myter that hang on the bishops backe
doe signifie
that hee neither vnderstood the old nor new testament
alnarus pelagius complaineth
that the bishops of spaine committed thousands of soules to their kinsmen priests
that had no learning
and the germanes of late told adrian the sixt
that vnlearned idiots
vnfit
vile
and ridiculous fellowes were made priests
the monkes and friers at this houre can scarce read their canonicall houres
for in the monasterie of fulda
the monkes accused rabanus manrus for being learned
and studying the scriptures
and neglecting their temporalities
but of late
lest children should mocke the popish priests
that cannnot read their masse with true accents
euery word in common missals is accented
and yet they misse every day
9 concerning their beastlinesse
both in ribaldry and other actions
i will insist the 9 their beastlinesse lesse
because the are filthy
and can no way delight either chaste eares
nor a ciuill auditorie yet to keepe correspondency with my diuision
something must be spoken befitting this discourse
and agreeable to the section
in other places as well as there
when women came to confession
the friers and priests would demand of them
whether they were sodomites or no
many times putting them in mind of that
which they vnderstood not
and causing a filthinesse to bee practised
which before they knew
you shall reade in the life of iuniperus
whom saint francis held for an honest man
that hee commonly vsed to defile his bed
by rauening in of hotch-pot dyet
as seething cabages
roots
bacon
beefe
flesh
veale
pidgeons
and all together
without either scumming the pot
or cleanely dressing
they tell it for a iest
and yet not to bee denied
that the monke ruffinus droue away the diuell
by threatening to vntrusse a point in his throat
in the life of saint dominick
a certaine man was possessed with diuels
whereupon the saint bound about his necke certaine relicks
whereof some of them were no better then shitten clouts at the least
whose perfume the diuels could not abide
and therefore cryed out they would depart
but the holy man would not beleeue them
till the relicks were sureties for them
as hee also preached
the women were amazed
and cryed out
that if hee said true
they had serued a very strange master
he bade them be quiet
and they should see what master they had serued
wherevpon enters in among them an vgly cat
with flaming eyes
shewing his posteriors vnto them
which were more filthy then in other beasts
at last he leapes into the belfry
and left such a stinke behinde him
that had almost choaked them all
in the legend of s
dominick
a nun called mary
had a sore thigh
for which she praied to s
dominick
as daring not to pray to god
who pittying her
came to her when shee was asleepe
and anointed the place
pope felix the eighth after s
gregory
built a church in the honour of s
cosmas
and s
damias
wherein one had his thigh almost rotted off with a canker
but these saints came with salues and ointments
yea tooke very excrements to cure the fellow
but when they sawe they could doe no good
they cut off a legge of an aethiopian newly buried
and put it to the man
and so cured him
at lodone in gascoine
the mouse that had eaten their bready god
was canonized
and called the holy mouse
the famous fransciscan de cornibus
died of the neapolitan disease
yet
when the buttons and pimples brake foorth
and made him looke fiery red
they reported he became a seraphin
yea
when a gentlewoman died of the stinke
by kissing of his feet
it rather confirmed their opinion
then gaue them eyes to looke into the villanie
when a certaine cardinall made report
that there was a woman possessed by a diuell
who could not be coniured
no
quoth lon the publick notarie
giue her but a glister of holy-water
and the diuell will be gone
i warrant you
it is written in the life of pope sixtus the 4
that hee granted libertie to the whole familie of the cardinall of
s
luce
to vse carnall company with the male sex
during the three hottest moneths
and pope alexander the 6
permitted peter mendozze
a spaniard
and cardinall of valentia
to make a ganimede of his bastard sonne
the marquesse of zannet
but of this no more

concerning their fooleries

10
their fooleries
i know not werhe to begin
nor once beginning
how to make an end
for there are so many remarkable things of this kinde
that i stand amazed at the blindnesse of former times
that could not discouer such fopperies and abuses
and wonder at their superstitious ignorance
which would not suffer them to be led into the fairer fields of knowledge
but to the purpose
a franciscan
putting on a short garment
and leauing off his breeches of purpose
vsed such emphaticall speeches and gestures to the people which stood before him
about the passion of christ on a good friday
that they fell a weeping
but such as were behinde
seeing his naked buttocks
as he bowed himselfe
fell also a laughing
he proued so ridiculous in the action
robert liciencis
another franciscan
could cause either sorrow
or laughter
by the enforcement of his words
and manner of his gesture
yea he had a tricke to winne wagers with his pot-companions of eithers enforcement
a frier hauing a sweet-hart
who loued him extraordinarily
but could not endure his habit
he took occasion one day to preach of the warres against the turk
and comming to the point of choosing a generall
or captaine
hee threw off the gowne
and preached in the habit of a souldier
which became him so well
that his sweet-heart seeing him
was much delighted with his presence
and when for this and other fooleries hee was sent for before the cardinals
hee answered them very merrily and reuerently
that he did it to please his loue
not in any contempt of his order
or the catholike religion
a certaine curate complained to his parishioners in this sort
alas
what would you haue me doe
o my parishioners
you bring me no offerings
and i see none of you dye
how shall i liue then
thinke ye
the franciscans of enreux counterfetted a ghost
or a spirit
to procure money
and a yong franciscan nouice
called harecourt
at orleans
counterfetted the ghost of the prouost marshals wife
because he gave but sixe crownes to the franciscans
at triers in germany
in the abbey of saint simon
saint iosephs pantophles haue beene in request a long time
and in aix they shewed his breeches
with the virgin maries smocke
nay
there is not so much as the tayle of the asse
on which our sauiour rode
but it is at genoa accounted for a relicke
and in the countrey of loraine the holy hay found in the cratch
where our sauiour was laid
is very famous
at the blacke-friers in arles
at vigand in languedock
and at florence
the stones are shewed that kill &apos;d saint steuen
with the arrowes wherewith saint sebastian was wounded
when nicodemus tooke our sauiour downe from the crosse
he gathered some of his bloud
and put it in one of the fingers of his gloue
by which he wrought many miracles
&amp; for which he was persecuted by the iewes
so that hee was glad to bee rid of it
and tooke a piece of parchment
writing therein all his miracles
and what the bloud was
rowling it together
and inclosing it in the beake of a bird
and so tying it hard
cast it into the sea
but after 1200 yeeres
the waues draue it into normandy
among certaine shrubs
where a duke found it
and built the abbey of beck in the place
for hunting of a stagge
and losing him and the dogges
they were all found kneeling before the birds bill
which when it was searched
discouered the secret
and the miracle wrought the duke to deuotion
and as i said
made him build a glorious abbey
what say you to christs bloud kept in vyals
gathered from vnder the crosse by his mother
the teares of christ
the swaddling bands of christ

many great men and potentates of the worlde
when thei haue by their vnlauful and vnrighteous attemtes
brought themselues into extreme miseries
haue at laste much blamed their vnfortunable estate
for that they in due time lacked counsel to haue withdrawen them from such enterprises
so it is saide in the common prouerbe
that the riche and mightye haue seldome good councell
excepte they get it of themselues
for riches and hye dignitie causeth them to be more insolent
so that they can abide any thing better
then to be tolde of theyr faultes
and the rewarde of hym that shoulde franckely tell them the truth
may soner be a brokehead then otherwyse
thys prudent men perceyuing
rather wythdrawe them selues from them
than with wearying them selues in vayne procure to them selues displeasure
and flatterers seyng a redy pray at theyr handes
dayly folowe vpon them
wyth vpholdyng theyr dedes and woordes good or bad al is excellently deuised
prudentlye spoken
done lyke a good man
thus wyth their owne pride climbyng and with flattery pricked forward
thei runne headlong in their imaginations
til they tomble downe into the pyt of destruction
and then thei lay the blame from them selues to other
wher indede they wold neuer heare other
but snch as serued
yea rather deceyued theyr affections wyth flatteries
but agaynst sutche headstrong hastynes we are admonished by the holy gost saying
be not wise in thine owne conceit
fear god
&amp; depart from euil
thys we wysh that al menne wold well consider in their enterprises
first that ther is a god
not a blynd and deafe god
as the godles heithen painted iupiter at create
but an euerliuyng god that seeth all the wayes of adams children
that knoweth the oppress our and him that is oppressed
that wyl call all thynges into iudgement and to accompt and wyl render to euerye one his iust recompence vpon hys head
hym oughte men to fear
for whatsoeuer thei attempt yet at last
that he determineth must come to passe
and his wyl in all thynges shall be accomplished
this i pray you to consider now in dew time
least if you now forget it
it may hereafter chaunce to you as it hathe done to other that in theyr wealth lyttle studyed on these matters
god hath maruelously saued you from the handes of sutche as hated you
and set you in hye dignitie
more then euer you had in your lyfe
and doutles it is to do good and not euill
to correct and amend thinges amisse
not to destroy and breake downe thynges that are in good case and order
your procedinges begin strangelye
in that you at the fyrst go about to deface the holy woord of god
to set asyde christes institution
and to cal al this realme to blindenesse and errour
for if you take away the lyghte of gods woord from the worlde
what can men loke for at your handes
but destruction and errour
dauid saith
thy worde o lord is a candel for my feete psalm cxviii
and a light for my steppes
and christ sayeth
he that foloweth me
walketh not in darknes
but shal haue the lyght of life
we knowe that you haue in tymes past nothing fauored the scriptures to be in english
but haue euer winsed and kycked against them
but our hope was that once you wold amend
considering how gods goodnes called you to repentance
you were wont to alledge you dyd nothyng but as a common counselour
yea you obtested by god
that when menne were burned for the truthes sake
you nothyng procured to it
but dyd all that you might to the contrari
we wer glad to read this in your writings
but we besech you let the same nowe appeare in your dedes
so shal we the better beleue your writinges
but if now you rayse a newe persecution for the wordes sake
truely it shal be manifest to al men
that ye were gilty of al the blod that hath bene shed before time for the word of god
which blod though it be yet vnadueuged yet it remaineth fresh and new in the syght of god
wyth abels bloode crying vnto god
and with the bloode of the holye martirs saying
how longe tariest thou lorde holy and true
to iudge and to auenge our blode on them that dwell on the earth
doute ye not but their crye is heard and not forgotten afore god
for he maketh inquisition for their bloode
and remembreth them
and forgetteth not the complaint of the poore
the office of a byshop is not to be a butcher
it is to preache gods word
not to put it downe
to help such as be captiues
not to cast into pryson the ryghteouse that are at liberty
to carry the poore lambes vpon their shoulders
not to seke al meanes possible to consume them with fyre or halter
o miserable lambes that shall haue sutch shepherdes
whose study is not to feede them
but to kepe them from the pasture of gods word
and to poyson them with dreames of mens imaginations
o horrible iudgement of god
that christ and his gospell shal be called new learning and heresye
what can the turcke do more then rayle agaynste christ and blaspheme his holye testament
yet must christen men be compelled to hear antichrist
and to hold their peace
when the blood of the new testament is blasphemed
what is in your lattin masse
to edify with the churche of england
that al thinges read or doone in the common congregation
should be done in that tonge that the congregation vnderstandeth
that the vnlearned may say amen
and boner hath set vp agayne in paules salesburi latin portace
wherof the lai men vnderstandeth no word
and god knoeth no more do the greater parte of the portas patterers
paul had the spirite of christe
and what can we iudge of boner doing contrary to saynt paules doctrine
yf the most godly and perfecte booke of seruice whiche euen you your selfe haue both in preachynge and writing commended please not him
why doth he not set out his church seruice in english
but he knoweth wel inough that there is sutche monstruouse thinges in it
that if it were in englishe
english boies woulde laughe it scorne
sutch lyes ar in the saintes legendes
such manifest errours
that no coullour can defend them yet muste these occupye the place
and that in lattin to make symple and plaine people beleue
that ther is in the lattin tong some priuy holy mistery truthe needeth no corners or clokes to hide it selfe
nor to be in a straunge hid tong
as errours euer seke the darknes to be their shield and defense euery one that doth euil as christ saieth hateth the lighte
iho iii and commeth not to the light
that his dedes should not be reproued
but he that doth the truth commeth to the light
that hys deedes maye be knowen
for they are done in god christ ordeined the holy communion that christen men shoulde together eate the holy bread
and drinke the holy cuppe in the remembraunce of his body broken
and his blood shed
paule deliuered to vs the same that he receiued of the lord
commaundynge vs saying
as oft as ye shal eate of thys bread
and drincke of this cup
ye shall shew the lordes death vntil he come
i prai you
how is this obserued in your priuate masses
wher your shauen prestes for the more parte can as well buylde poules steple
as fulfil poules commaundement
you haue not one word of scripture to maintaine this prophanation of christes institution
and it is an horrible and fearful thing that euer man mortall should presume sutch great impietie against the immortal and euerliuing god
you rage sore agaynst maried priestes which haue for them gods woorde
but you forget the vnchaste and detestable sodomies
incestes
aduoutries
fornications
murdring of infants
that hath bene found in the vnmaried sort of shaue linges
which haue no word of god but this
for sutche thinges sake
commeth the wrath of god vpon the children of vnbeliefe
and whore mongers and aduouterers shal not inherite the kingdome of christ
you bishops shoulde laye no snares to dampne mens soules
but rather helpe them oute that be in sutche dampnable estate
and that which gods word leaueth at libertie
you ought not to bring into bondage
that you depriue the maried prestes of their offices &amp; liuinges
it is very straunge
and no word of god haue ye so to dooe
and we nothing doubt it
but thoughe god at this present exercises the patience of his seruantes
yet he wil at last remember hys promise
for the rroubles sake of the oppressed
and because of the complaint of the poore
i wil vp saith the lorde i wyll helpe them
and set them at rest
and in esai the lord saith
wo be to the thou robber
shalte not thou be robbed also
thou that despisest other
shalt not thou also be despised
the lord wil doutles heare the sorowful wepings of the poore widdowes and fatherles children which by this robbery are dryuen to beggerie
the lord heareth the praier of the oppressed
he wil not despise the praier of the fatherles
nor the widdowe lamentably complainyng to hym
doth not god see the teares of the widdow
and hear her exclamation against sutch as cause her to wepe
from her cheke they ascend into heauen
and the lorde that fauourablye heareth her
wyll haue no pleasure in them
for gods honor therfore
and for feare of his iudgement
cal these things to your minde
and somewhat mitigate these hasty and rashe doinges
whiche are against god &amp; his word
for though the lord hath called you to be a scourge to other
yet remember he commanudeth you to do nothing vnrighteouselye
for he is a god that willeth none vnrighteousenes
their may no vngodly persone dwell with him
sutch as be cruell
may not stand in his sight
he is enemy vnto al wicked doers
he destroieth the lyars and abhorieth the bloode thirstye and deceiteful
and as you now are reysed to scourge others
so if you vexe the innocent
doutles the lord will throw you downe
and rayse vppe them that shall scourge you againe
and fulfill christes worde
with what measure ye meate to other
the same shal be measured to you againe
remember we besech you
that as glory groweth
so enuie against you groweth
not of good
but of euell men
who thoughe they nowe lyke echo rebound euer with pleasaunt sound of your owne voice
yet wil they if god a little withdrawe his hande from you be the first that shal reioyse at your fall
god wil withdraw his hand from you
if you repugne against his word
if you seeke to deface his truth
to cast aside christes supper
to condempne mariage
to set vp againe idolatrie
superstition and errour
to bring in againe that sodomitical fained chastetie
that drew infinite vnto eternal dampnation
we neede not recite vnto you examples what god hath done with princes and potentates
that haue enterprised to resist his truthe
or els to abuse it to their owne priuate lustes
seing you haue not onely read
but sene before your eyes
onelye we praye god you may remember what was said to
saule saule why persecutest thou me
he saide
lorde who art thou
the lord saide
i am iesus whom thou persecutest
it shal be hard for the to kicke against the pricke
it is the lord iesus that in his members suffereth
it is his worde that is hated and persecuted
it is he that mercifullye calleth you to repentaunce
and he is able inoughe to represse all violence done agaynste him
but as he came from heauen to saue sinners
so wolde he rather call saule to repentance
then cast nero into destruction
but when al thinges shal declar you impenitent
&amp; manifest rebellour against godes worde
then without doubte the lord wil no more spare you
than he hath before time spared other
for goddes sake therfore beware in dew time and take example at others
least other here after take example at you

purchased the blody feld
for he hong himselfe

how wel sped hieroboam for erecting his golden calues at bethell and berseba
looke for no better rewarde for erectiug your satisfactory sacrifice
but how craftely do you cloine in this
you wil commaunde no man
but they shall say you
gratifie the quene

we are afraid you wil bring the wrath of god vpon her &amp; al this realm of england
as the p ̄ stes &amp; ꝓphetes of dan &amp; bethel brought it vpon the kings of israel and iuda
you tel the quene the people is desirous of masses
and that they neuer fauoured the scriptures
and you tell the people
the quencs pleasure is that they receiue againe the masse and poperie
thus you cause no small number of harts to be withdrawen from that harty loue and affection that thei ought to beare to the quenes highnes
and as mutch as in you is sowe the sede of discention
which the lord of heauen keepe from amonge vs
and graunt you to take wiser wares

and quieted in the right way of gods word
and wolde haue continued in the same
if you and others had not wyth your dampnable perswasions
craftie surrelties
cruell handlings
gone about to peruert them

some for feare of punishment and losse

as redye to tourne with euerye winde

but the slipperie sand of pleasing men

dout not but at last ye shal haue some cardinals hat for your laboure
thincke not but god can raise a hiehue when his pleasure is

he answered
arte thou one of the kynges councel
holde thi peace that isse the not
so you wil say
hold thi peace thou heretike
or come fourth to dispute thi matters
if ye wil dispute by the holy scriptures
by the doctors of the primatiue church
it is alredi profred vnto you
but ye know ye can haue none aduantage that wai
for your owne consience accuseth you
that ye are not able to stande
either with scriptures or auncient doctours to preuaile againste the truthe
as litle honoure will come therof to you in disputyng
as is alredy wonne in writynge
therefore your olde argumentes which your preachers now at poules crosse
most earnestly beat into the peoples heades are suresby
fyre &amp; faggot dispatcheth at once
but happie were ye
that such argumentes were not made againste you
well then
marke what the prophet answerd amasias at his departing
and know certainly it wil come to passe
the hande of the lorde is not shortned
thongh our iniquities at this present haue iustly prouoked his anger ouer vs
he will at laste pitie vs for his sonne christe our lordes sake
and we nothing doubt
but as he his al mightie &amp; can deliuer
so he his al ful of goodnes and wil saue all that trust in his mercie and call vpon him day and night
and thankes to god the people hathe other eyes
then they haue had in times past
the holy woord of god hathe not been all so baren
as you woulde it had been
men haue some knowledge beetwene a latine satisfactori popishmasse and christes communion truly ministred according to the ghospel
though you bost chastitie of pristes
men know a difference betwene a single lyfe
&amp; a chast life
yeares since some of your vnmaried pristes
yea as it said one of your great doctors
wer complained on for their hote chastitie that bournt a woman
men remember yet since some pristes were indicted for getting wemen with childe
and murdering the children when thei were borne
oh horrible chastitie to be suffered amonge christians god doubtles will viset these thinges in due time
as he visited the sinnes of the wicked before time
marke how he rod was eaten with wormes nero slew himselfe
iulianus confessed christ in death against his wyl
antiochus stanke aboue the earth
but to come nerer our daies
more and fisher with frier forest &amp; other
desperatly died in the contempt of the gospel
dudleia disceitful tirant deceiued with hope of pardon
blasphemed the gospel at the hour of death
of whom ye make a piller to staie vp youre church
beware of the sinne against the holy gost
which shal not be forgeuen in this worlde
not in the worlde to come
those that dispise moses
die without redemption
vnder two or iii witnesses
but howe sorer punnishment remaineth
for them
that tread vnder fote the bloud of the newe testament
and rayle vppon the spirit of grace
once again we beseche you
for iesus christes sake
and for the hope of the life to come
and for the iudgement that we all must come afore
remember these thinges
and think that he that wrote this for your admonishion loketh for no preferment at your hand but writeth it
if perchaunce ye be not altogether a damnable desperate
ye may conuert to god
reuerence his holi word geue place to his truthe
&amp; be saued from the wrath of god that is to come
god graunt vs al mercie and grace to turne to him
that we may be able to stand before the lord at his comming
when he shall arise to iudge the earth
reade the second psalme
and se what shall happen to the rebels against the lorde and christe his sonne
therfore feare the lorde
do homage vnto his son
serue him with trembling &amp; feat
receiu his doctrine
least he be angry with you
&amp; so you perishe from the right wai
for when his wrath shall be kindled like fire which shal be shortelie blessed shal al those be that trust in him

their crowne to forreine foes
against their queene for to rebel whose secrets god disclose
marke well
and read this story mine
though simple and rude it be
and to your queene with heart encline let treason from you flee
for i am one that captiue am
and know the spaniards heart
although he loue the traitors name
at length hee makes him smart
he giues the traitor daily pay
while treason is a working
but afterwards to his decay
he cuts him short from barking
which is the due and iust reward
that doeth belong to treason
the hangman takes him by the beard
to cut his head with reason
examples many i could bring
which lately hath bene prooued
of those that wrote to philip king
whose hearts to treason mooued
the youthfull duke of bragan soile
bargansiae cald by name
who gaue the portugall the spoile
and brought himselfe to shame
also the coundie of caskails
did ioine with him in treason
pretending for to purchase vailes
being void and cleare of reason
and so they sold their natiue land
to philip king of spaine
who hauing portugall in hand
as king therein did raigne
who sudainly did turne his face
from this good duke and gaue no credit to their race
wherein they knew the follie
therefore good christian countrimen
take heed
beware betime
let no false treason mooue you then
to pope
nor spanish king
let not affection blind your eies
nor popish tales deceiue
let not the spaniards tales nor lies
constraine you to beleeue
for they are deuils
and are not gods
seeing people they deceiues
i wish you well
beleeue him not
if you will liue at ease
therefore you saxon sorte
that rebels meane to liue
marke well
and reade the euill report
that portugals do giue
the southerne spanish race
that mankinde would subiect
to turne vs all from christes lawes
to liue in popish sect
repent therefore in time
and call to god for grace
to queene elizabeth doe incline

procure to beat the spaniards downe
the romanes
and the rest
examples good you may well take

therefore
good english knightes
be true vnto your queene
in noble mindes set your delights

marke well a captiues plaint
that doth lament your case
to queene elizabeth be you not faint
and call to god for grace

thy knowledge and astrologies art doth verifie the same
thy happy course that thou didst runne vnto the westerne land

carthagena eke doth crie
the westerne iles do greatly grone
thy force hath bin so nie
kalles likewise doth greatly feare
with reason thereunto
the narrow straites do daily care
because thou art their foe
thy enterprise hath bin so high
that turkes could not compare
nor with his gallies come so nigh
which makes them all to feare
the graund english they thee doe call of famous good report
the spaniards and the portingall
to england will resort
to serue the queene &amp; thee
good drake for thy good famous acts
the spanish king they will forsake with england to compact
thou art so dread as god is feard
in southerne coast and land
the spaniard daily shakes his beard
and feares thy mightie hand
therefore good worthie drake
serue thou thy soueraigne queene
and make the spanish foe to quake
and english force be seene
for helpe and aide thou shalt not want thy vertuous queene is bent
money and victualles is not scant
and men will not repent
if thou wilt follow victorie
as first thou diddest begin
all protestants will pray for thee
and for our gracious queene
the spaniards brag and make greate boast as thou dost partly knowe
a huge great fleete they make in haste
as letters mine did showe
wherein i writ a warning good
to thee and to the queene
rehearsing all both bad and good that in their fleete was seene
also i wrote the summe of men
as neare as i could learne
and sent it by an englishman
whereby thou mightest discerne
to knowe thy foes
and what they be
all kind of generation
the dukes and earles in their degree rehearsed by relation
their ships and force i daily wrote
and all their preparation
to name them all i missed not

or enquyre for better than that is
suppose not them to be wise men
that sharpely can talke of smalle thynges and trifles
but those that can substancially speke in matters of waighty importance
nor thynke not them wyse
that promisse to other men welthe and good fortune
they them selfe beynge in great necessyte
but rather those that spekyng of them selfes moderately
can with other men and in theyr affayres vse them selfe well and discretely
and being not troubled with any channge of theyr lyuynge
knowe howe to beare honestly and temperately as well aduersite as also prosperite
and meruaylle thou not
that i haue now rehersed many thinges that thou knewest before
nor that forgatte i not
but knewe well ynoughe
that beynge suche a multitude as well of princis as of priuate persones
some of them haue spoken the same that i dyd
&amp; many haue harde it
&amp; dyuers haue sene other men done it
and some there be that by them selfes haue experienced it
notwithstandyng in matter concernynge instructyon
noueltie is not to be souhgt for
for therin ought not to be founden eyther synguler opinion
or thynge impossyble
or contrary to mens expectacyon
but suppose that to be in herynge mooste gracyouse or pleasaunte
whiche beynge sowen in the myndes of other
may assemble moste matter to the pourpose
and the same declare beste and mooste aptly
for this knowe i wel
that the counsayles and wyse sentences of poetes and other good authours
are thoughte of all menne to be very profytable
yet wyll not they gladly gyue eare vnto them
but be therwith in the same case
as they be with these that do giue them good counsayle
for they prayse them all
but they care not howe seldome they come in theyr company
desyrynge to be rather with offendours
than with them that of synne be the rebukers
example we may take of the poemes or warkes of hesiodus
theognes
and phocillides
for euery man affyrmeth them to be excellent counsayles coucerning mannes lyfe
but al though they say so
yet had they leuer vse that
wherto theyr owne madnesse induceth them
than folowe that
wherto the others preceptes doeth aduyse them
moreouer if one shuld gader out of the said authors that which men cal sentences
wherin they perchance haue ben studiouse
in semblable wise towardes them shulde they be disposed
for they shuld with more plesure here a lyeng fable or fantasy
than the sayd preceptes made by moch connyng and diligence
but what nedeth it to tary longe vpon euery mater
genyrally if we wyll consyder the natures of men
we shal perceiue
that many of them delyte neyther in meates that ben most holsome
nor in studies that ben most honest
nor in dedes that is most conuenyent
nor yet in doctryne that is mooste commodiouse
but imbracynge pleasaunte appetites
whiche be repugnaunt to profite
wolde seme to be painful and laboriouse
how may any man content any suche persons
eyther by preachinge or teachyng
or tellyng of any thing that is profitable
that for the wordes that be spoken
do ennie and haue indygnacion at them that speke truly
and do take them for playne men or symple
in whome lacketh wysedome
so moche they abhorre trouthe in all thynges
that they knowe not what is theyrs
or do belong to their office
but consultynge or raysonynge of that which doth partayne vnto them
they be sadde and vnpleasaunte
whan they talke of other mennes affayres they be merye and ioyouse
more ouer they hadde leuer suffre some griefe in their bodies
than in reuoluyng what shuld be moste necessary
trauayle any thyng in theyr mindes
and if a man take good hede
he shall fynde in theyr mutuall assembles and companies
that eyther they reproue other men
or els that they of other be in some thynge reproued
and whan they be by themselfes
they be euer wisshinge and neuer consultinge
i haue not spoken this agayne all men but only againe them that be giltie in that which i haue rehersed
finally this is apparraunte and certayne
who so euer wyl make or wryte any thynge pleasaunte and thankfull to the multytude
he may not seke for wordes or maters moste profitable
but for them that contayne most fables and leasynges
for in herynge such thynges they reioyce
but whan they perceyne to be labours and contentions in theyr affayres
than be they pensife
wherfore homere and they that founde fyrst tragedyes
may be well maruayled at
who in theyr warkes vsed bothe the sayd fourmes in wrytynge
for homere expressed in the contencions and batayles of them
whiche for theyr vertues were named halfe goddes
the other brought those fables in to actuall apparaunce
in so moche as we not onely may here them
but also may presently beholde them
by such example it is declared to them that be studiouse to please their herers
that they must abstayne frome exhortynge and counsayllynge them
and that they apply them to wryte and speke that onely
where in they perceyue the multitude to haue most delectation
this before wrytten haue i declared
thynkynge that it besemeth not the that are not one of the people
to be of lyke opynyon with the multytude
nor to iudge thynges to be honest
or men to be plesaunt
accordynge to thy sensuall appetite
but to trye and esteme them by theyr good and profytable actes
moreouer for as moche as they that labour in the study of philosophy
concernynge the exercyse of the myndes
be of sundry opynions
some sayenge that men become wiser by moche disputynge and raysonyng
other affyrme that it hapneth by exercyse in polytyke gouernaunce or cyuill causis
dyuers suppose it to come of other doctrynes
but finally they all do confesse
that he whiche is well brought vp
may by euery of the sayd studyes gather mater suffycient to geue good counsayle
therfore he that wyll leaue the doubtfull opinions
and wyl apply to that which is certayne
he must examyne the raysons therof
and specyally they that be counsailors ought to haue consideration of the occasyon
tyme and oportunyte
if they can not brynge that to passe
than to reiecte and put a way as well them which speke in al maters generally
as also those that knowe nothynge that is expedyent or necessary
for it is apparante and certayne
that he whiche can not be to him selfe profitable
he shall in other mens busynesse do nothyng wisely
make moch of them that be wyse
and do perceyue more than other men
and haue good regarde towarde them
remembrynge that a good counsaylour
a good counsaillour
is of all other treasure the most royal and profytable
and thynke veryly that they which can most ayde and profyte to thy wytte or reason
shall make thy kyngedome moste ample and honorable
wherfore for my part as moch as i can
i haue exhorted the
and honored the with such presentes as be in my power to geue the and desyre thou not
that other men shuld bryng vnto the

1
of the miserable birth of man
and of his first calamities
man being the image of god
and the chiefe worke of nature
of all other creatures is most miserable in his birth
for
both beasts and birds are brought into the world
either couered with haire
feathers
or wooll
not so much as the séeds and corne of the ground
but nature hath clothed them with eares and huske
man onely excepted
for he being once come from the prison of his mothers wombe
séemeth no other thing
but the similitude of a poore worme
that commeth creeping out of the earth
with what clothing is he couered
making his entry into the palace of this world
but only with bloud
where in he is bathed and couered
the which signifieth no other thing but the image and figure of sin
what is the first song that he singeth at his comming into the world
but only wéepings &amp; waylings
which are as messengers
and foreshewers of his calamities to come
the which because he cannot expresse in words
he witnesseth by tears
likewise pittifull cryes in the beginning of monarchs
emperours
and kings
and others
that cause so many tragedies to happen in the world
but now contrariwise
the worme
be he neuer so little
as soone as nature hath brought him out of the earth
beginneth to craull and creepe
and to séeke for food
the little chicken so soone as he is out of the shell
is found cleane
and needeth not to be washed like vnto man
but runneth after the hen
and knoweth when he is called
he picketh and eateth
hee feareth the kite
without proouing before her malice
he flyeth danger only guided by nature
but behold man
so soone as he is come into the world
is like vnto a little monster
and a lumpe of flesh
which will let himselfe to be eaten of other beasts
if he be not séen vnto
and die for hunger before he can find his mothers breast
and will as soone eat poyson
as good meat
and handle hot from
before he can discerne the good from the euill
yet for all this
he nameth himselfe the prince of all other creatures
thus man being brought into this miserable world
and plunged in the gulfe of miseries
he then requireth to haue norishment and clothing
to comfort the infirmity of his nature
the office of which is appointed to mothers
in consideration whereof nature hath giuen them breasts
which are like two little bottles
very proper and necessary for their sustenance
but now to speake of the misery of man in his nurriture
how many mothers are there at this day in the world
nay rather we may truly call them cruell stepmothers
who hauing according to nature
brought their children forth into the world
&amp; because they will not take a little paines to nourish them themselues
they send them to sorry villages to be nursed of strange &amp; vnknowne nurses
which oftentimes do change their children &amp; bring home others in their stead
yet for all this they wil not be ashamed to hold a litle dog in their armes rather than the fruit that was ingendred in their wombes
this inhumane practise is not vsed amongst beasts be they neuer so brutish
for their natures are such
that they neuer put their yong ones in the kéeping of others
though nature giue them neuer so many
but they nourish them themselues
and are such zealous protectors of their young ones
that they kéepe them almost alwayes in their presence
till such time as they can auoid danger
and that which is more to be marueiled at
there riseth a certaine strife betweene the male and the female
which of them shall be the kéeper
and for that intent they many times quarrell and fight one with another
the which may be séene not only in apes
but also in beares
which in nature are fierce and cruell
yet they haue so great affection to their young ones
that they are not onely content to nourish them with their milke
but as soone as they are brought forth
hauing almost no forme or fashion
they licke them and pollish them to make them more perfect
likewise the little birds
couering fiue or sixe vnder their wings
&amp; hauing neither graine nor other seed for their sustenance
notwithstanding they spare neither art nor diligence
wherewith nature hath endued them
for their nourishment
it is therefore a true witnesse of humane misery
in that children are forced against nature
to sucke the milke of a strange woman
and many times of such a one as may bée found best cheape
what corruption or deformity soeuer she haue
the which many times is so contagious to their children
that it were better for them to be nourished by some bruit beast in the wildernes
than to be put into the custody of such a nurse
as for example
the cruelty and infamous life of caligula the fourth emperour of rome
was not imputed to father or mother
but to the nurse that gaue him sucke
which woman was so cruell and barbarous of her selfe
that she rubbed the nipples of her breasts with blood
causing the child to whom she gaue milke
to sucke them
the which thing was so well practised of him
that he did not onely commit an infinite number of murvers
but many time licked his sword and dagger being bathed and stayned in blood
and wished that all the world had but one head
to the end that with one blow he might behead them
and then reign alone vpon the earth
séeing then that the child hath not felt or suffered sorrow enough in his mothers wombe
but as soone as he is borne
there is prepared a new sorrow for him by the ingratitude of such mothers which are so delicate and tender of themselues
that they will not nourish them
but cause them to sucke the milke of those that oftentimes doe change their fruit
or else féed them with corrupted milke
by the which meanes in processe of time
there riseth a number of diseases
to the great hurt of poore children
&amp; continuall reproch of their mothers
this is of a truth and often verified
that if the nurse bee froward
the child will be froward
not by receiuing of their milke
but by often looking vpon it
if she be a drunkard
she will cause the child to be the like
as it is read in the life of the emperour tiberius
who was a great drunkard
for that the nurse the gaue him sucke
did not onely drinke vnmeasurably
but also did féed the child with soppes tempered in wine
here you may sée that the nurses haue so much power as to forme the manners and body of the child
so that if shee be sickely
she rendereth the child sickenesse
if she be wicked
she causeth the child also to be wicked
but heere i will leaue children in their nurses kéeping
and speake of their following calamities
in how many dangers be they wrapped whilst they be a nursing
some will burst with crying
some neuer rest in quiet all the night long
so that their nurses can take no sléepe
some when they can scant goe
will fall and breake their faces
and their lims
so that many times there is séene about them many grieuous wounds
besides the diseases which they take by nature
but who will not wonder to sée the fantasticall maners of little children
who for the most part will dabble in the water and channels like a little ducke
making little houses of earth
counterfeting the horsemen in riding on a little sticke
running after dogs and cats
and will be angry with some
and pleased with others
who would thinke that such a miserable creature
by succession of time
would become so proud and lofty
therefore if we will consider it
we haue iust cause to mourne at their births
and reioyce at their burials
if the prophet ieremy bewailed the captiuity of the iewes in babilon
if anchises lamented the destruction of proud troy
if the consul marcellus lamented the city of syracusa when he saw it on fire
and salust the corruption of rome
we may well with so many men of fame
bewaile the miserable entry that man maketh into this world
his dangerous aduancement
and sorrowfull departure
all which being profoundly considered by the prophet ieremy
in the 20
chapter
he bewaileth his birth
and murmureth against the knées that held him vp
&amp; also the breasts that gaue him sucke
likewise the same prophet ieremy in the aforesaid chapter
considering that man is made of dust &amp; earth
conceiued in sin
borne in paine
and at the last made a prey for wormes
doth with that his mothers wombe had serued for his tombe
iob in his fourtéenth chapter
likewise setteth man out in his right colours
when he saith
man that is borne of a woman hath but a short time to liue
and is full of misery
out of these words we may gather somewhat
for amongst all the creatures whom god hath created
there is none subiect to more miseries than a woman
especially those that are fruitfull and beare children
for they haue scant a monthes rest in a whole yeare
but are continually ouercome with sorrow
and feare
then he saith
hauing a short time to liue
indéed what is more shorter than the life of man
vnto whom in stopping his nose and his mouth
the life is gone
for his life is nothing but a blast of wind inclosed therein
i haue read of many that haue murmured against nature for giuing long life to harts and rauens
whose liues bring no profit
and vnto man
king of all things vpon earth
but a short life
although hee knoweth how to imploy his time
and yet the little time that he hath to liue
is shortned by sléepes
dreames
sorrowes and cares
therefore wee may iustly say
that mans life is full of misery and sorrow
chap
ij
of the misery of man entring into his youth
and yeeres of discretion
yee haue alreadie heard discoursed and shewed in order
what perils and dangers man hath at his first comming into the world
now therefore let vs consider what he is when he is sprung vp
and whether that there bée an end of his miseries or no
of which
if we bee equall iudges
wee shall finde that hee doth rather increase than decrease the miseries
for this is the time of mans life wherein nature doth reare against him a more furious combate
for his blood beginneth to rise
the flesh prouoketh him to his owne pleasure
the wicked world espyeth him
the deuill tempteth him
and his selfe-wild youthfulnesse leadeth him
so that it is impossible
but that he which is assayled with so many vices
and succoured of none
in the end is discomfited and ouercome
for in the body of youth
riot
liberty and deliciousnesse aboundeth
for all the uices in the world
saith marcus aurelius
doe there plant their siege
therefore it behooueth when the trées are young
to vphold them
and to loppe the ouer-waighty branches
if afterward yée intend to gather any fruit
likewise it is necessary to reforme and correct the uices that reigne in youth
least afterward it returne to the parents shame and reproach
but there are at this day
many fathers and mothers
which for default not to haue well instructed their children in their youth
doe receiue much sorrow and griefe in their age
moreouer
there are many mothers
which in stead of giuing them good and godly instructions
nourish and bring them vp in voluptuousnesse and pride
and although they be nourishers of their bodies
so are they destroiers of their soules
if hely was grieeuously punished with his children
for that he did not so sharpely chastise them as their offences did require
what shall become of these fathers and mothers
which in stead of correctors
are their childrens corruptors
such parents may well be compared to apes
which kill their young ones by too much strayning them betweene their armes
and keeping them so déere
and this is the cause that so many fall into the hands of the hangman
which are to them
reformers and correctors
many there bee that in stead of giuing good exhortations to their family
doe shew them first themselues naughty and wicked examples
for the first commandement that they giue them how to liue well
is to blaspheme
sweare
exercise gluttony
and drunkennesse
to spoyle the substance of their youth
to be fornicators
and to kisse women and maydens in their presence
there be also many mothers héere in england
that learne their daughters to dance
to vse rhetoricke termes
to haunt companies
to scoffe and flout
to paint and colour their faces
to decke their fingers with ringes
and their neckes with iewels
as though they were iewell sellers
pretending to keepe a shop
but in the end it will happen to them as it did to the prophet dauid
2 king
13
&amp; 15
whose sinne was punished in his children
which were most of them so wicked
that the one of them deflowred his owne sister
and the other killed his brother
and afterward sought the death of his owne father
and chased him out of his kingdome
the ancient philosophers maintained this argument
that all sinnes committed in this world
were punished in the world to come
except the sinne that man committeth in the bringing vp of his children
and for that
he suffereth punishment in this world
for the father can giue nothing to his child but fraile and mortall flesh
by the corruption whereof the life taketh end
but by good learning &amp; knowledge
eternall praise and memory is gotten
therefore to conclude
if that children haue béen in great misery
being nourished with spotted milke
yet the misery doubleth in those that should cause them to be instructed
for the food of the body is more vile than the food of the soule
but now when he is come to the seuenth yeare of his age
it behooueth his parents to haue tutors and schoole-masters for to instruct him in good learning
but growing further into yeeres
and comming to his adolescency
it is needfull then to haue more rigorous reformers for to tame his wilde youth
and to breake him to labour
of the misery of man being come to his full strength
hauing finished this our second discourse
man is growne to his full perfection both of strength and discretion
in which time hee entereth into déeper cogitations and trauell in the spirit
it is requisite therefore
that he frequent publike places
that he haunt the company of those that are as touchstones for to know the good from euill
if he be come of a great and a noble stocke
he must make many enterprises of warre
put himselfe in perils
hazard his life
and shed his blood for to die in the bed of honour
or else he shall be reputed a dastardly coward
and vtterly despised of all men
if he be of bare estate
and that he be called to the knowledge of arts
sciences
and néedfull trades
yet for all that
he runneth into a thousand dangers
trauels
paines and troubles
as well of the body as of the soule
he toyleth day and night
and sweateth water and blood to get a maintenance during his life
and oftentimes it is seene that what paines soeuer man taketh for his liuing
yet it is scant sufficient to serue his necessity
it is not therefore without cause that marcus aurelius was wont to say
when he considered the misery of mankind
i mused in my mind
sayd he
whether there might be found in any age a man that could vaunt
that he neuer in al his life-time tasted aduersity
and assuredly
if there might be such a one found
hée would be such a fearefull monster vpon the earth
that all liuing things would be amazed to behold him
then he concluded after this sort
saying
and in the end i found mine owne thoughts true
for he that was yesterday rich
was to day poore
he that was yesterday in health
was to day sicke
he that laughed yesterday
to day did weepe
he that was yesterday in prosperity
was to day in aduersity
and he that was yesterday aliue
was to day dead ▪ but let vs now returne to our former matter
and set down our discourses in order
what liuing man is he in all the world
that hath giuen himselfe to any science
or otherwise to liue
but that at one time or other
he disliketh of his owne profession
and is weary thereof
and for the better vnderstanding of the same
we will particularly discourse the miseries
and troublesome liues of all the principall estates liuing vpon the bosome of the sinfull earth
chap
iv
of the misery of wicked kings
princes
and monarches
searching into all estates of men
wée shall finde that fortune aboue all other mortall creatures
hath prouided for kings most liberally
for what maketh man more happy in this world
than goods
honours
dignities
and rule
licence to doe good or euill without controulement
power to exercise liberality
and all kind of pleasure
as well of the body as of the mind
all that may be wished for to the contentation of man
either in varietie of meats
magnificence in seruice
or in vestures
to raise at their pleasure the meanest man to high place
and with a frowne
disgrace the mightiest
all which continually is at a princes command
there is nothing that may please the memory
or flatter the desires of the flesh
but is prepared for them euen from their cradles
onely to make their liues more happy and full of felicity
but now if wée iudge of their liues vprightly
and waigh them in a true ballance
wée shall finde that the selfe same things which makes them happy in this world
are the very instruments of vice
and the cause of greater sorrowes
for what auaileth their costly ornaments
honourable seruices
and delicate meats
when that they are in continuall feare to be poysoned
wrong seduced
and often beguiled by their seruitours
haue we not had experience therof many times
doth not histories report
that some princes haue bin poysoned with papers
and with the smoake of torches
wée may reade likewise of certaine emperors that dust not lye downe to rest in the night
before they had caused their beds to be lyen on
and all the corners of their chambers to bee searched
least they should be strangled or murthered in their sléepes
others that would not permit any barbers to touch their faces
for feare that in trimming of their heads or beards
they would cut their throats
and yet to this day they are in such feare
that they dare not put meate in their mouthes before their taster haue tasted thereof
what felicity can a king or prince haue
that hath many thousands of men vnder their gouernments
when hee must watch for all
heare the complaints and cryes of euery one
procure euery mans safegard
prouoke some to do well by liberall gifts
and others by terrour and feare
hée must nourish peace amongst his subiects
and defend his realme against the inuasion of forraine enemies
besides many other calamities that are depending vpon a regall crowne
but now touching the vnhappy states of wicked princes
vnto whom thrée kindes of people are most agréeable
and familiar
the first are flatterers
which bée the chiefe enemies to all uertue
and they that impoyson their soules with a poyson so pestiferous
that it is contagious to all the world
their princes folly
they call prudence
their cruelty
iustice
their letchery
wantonnesse
their fornications ▪ pleasures and pastimes
if they bee couetous
they call it good husbandry
if they bee prodigall
they call it liberality
so that there is no vice in a prince
but they cloake it vnder the shadow of some uertue
the second sort are such
who neuer rest night
but that in the morning they bring in some new inuention or other
how to taxe and draw money from the poore people
and generally all their study is imployed to bée wastfull and prodigall in the exactions and miseries of the poore commons
the third and last sort are such
that vnder the cloake of kindnes and honesty
counterfayting good men
haue alwayes their eyes vpon other mens liuings
and make themselues reformers of vices
they inuent wicked and false deuices
not only how to get other mens goods
but oftentimes their liues
who before god are most innocent
behold
here you may well sée the manifold miseries that compasse scepters and states of princes
here are the thornes that they receiue in recompence of their brightnesse and royall dignity
which ought like a lampe to giue light to all the world
but when it is eclipsed or darkned with any vice
it is more reprochfull in them
than in any other priuate person whatsoeuer
for they sin not only in the fault which they commit
but also by the example that they giue
the abundance of honours and pleasures that princes enioy
serueth as a baite to induce them to euill
and are the very matches to giue fire to uice
what was saul before hée was made king ▪ whose life is shewed in the holy scripture
whom god did elect
yet he made a sudden eclipse or changeing
how wonderfull was the beginning of the reigne of king salomon
the which being ouercome with royall pleasures
gaue himselfe as a prey to women
of two and twenty kings of iuda
there is found but fiue or sixe
that haue continued in their vertue
if we consider the estate of the assyrians
persians
grecians and egyptians
wee shall finde more of them wicked than good
if wee consider what the kings and romane emperours were
which hath béene the most flourishing common-wealth in the world
we shall find them so ouercome with vices
and all kind of cruelties
that i do almost abhorrs to speake of their corrupt &amp; defiled liues
what was the estate of their common-wealth
before that scilla &amp; marius did murmure against it
before that catiline and catulla did perturbe it
before that caesar and pompey did slander it
before that augustus and marcus antonius did destroy it
before that tiberius and caligula did defame it
before that domitian and nero did depraue it
for although they made it rich with many kingdomes and lordships
yet were the vices they brought with them
more greater than the kingdomes they gayned
for their goods and riches are consumed
yet their vices remaine vnto this day
what memory remaineth of romulus
that founded the city of rome
of numa pompilius
that erected the capitoll
of ancus martius
that compassed it with walles
did not they shew what felicity remaineth in high estates
who are more subiect to the assaults of fortune
than any other earthly creature
for many times the thred of life breaketh
when they thinke least of death
and then the infamy of those that bée wicked
remaineth written in histories
for a perpetuall memorie thereof
the which thing all estates ought more to regard a thousand times
than the tongue that speaketh euill
which can but shame the liuing
but bookes record a perpetuall infamy for euer
which thing being duely considered of by many emperours and kings in times past
they forsooke their scepters
and royal empires
and betooke them to an obscure life
resting better contented with a little in quiet
than to enioy with full sayle the crooked honours of the world
chap
v
of the misery of vicious courtiers
and of their wicked liues
what greater felicity can there bée in this world
than to bée in a princes fauour
to bee at his elbow at all times
to vse courtly manners
and other offices of humanity
of which number
there be some so subtile &amp; crafty
that they doe play as the fisherman
who as soone as he hath gotten any thing in his net
giueth ouer the court
and goeth his way
othersome there are
that play all out
and other that remaine vntill they become wonderous rich
and in the end
they are made to restore all backe againe
there are also others that doe nothing but inuent meanes to enlarge their treasures
and become wealthy with spoyling poore people
princes doe by them many times
as we doe by our hogs
we let them fatten to the end we may eate them afterward
so likewise are they suffered many times
to enrich themselues
to be disposed of afterward when they are fat
and one that is new come
oftentimes is preferred in their places
by this you may see that courtiers oftentimes do sell their libertie to become rich
for they must obey all commandements
they must frame themselues to laugh when the prince laugheth
to wéepe when he weepeth
approue that which he approueth
and condemne that which he condemneth
they must alter and change their natures
to be seuere with those that are seuere
sorrowfull with those that are sorrowfull
and in a manner transforme themselues
according to the nature of him whom they will please
or els he shal get nothing
to be briefe
they must frame themselues
to his manners and nature
and yet many times one little offence staineth all the seruice they haue done in their life time before
many in princes courts put off their cappes to them
whom they would gladly see cut shorter by the head
and often bow their knees to doe them reuerence
whom they wish had broken their neckes
here you may sée ▪ the life of a great number of vicious courtiers
which is no life
but rather a lingring death
here you may sée wherein their youth is imployed
which is no youth
but a transitory death
for when they come to age
they bring nothing from thence but gray heads
their feete full of gouts
their backes full of paine
their hearts full of sorrow
and their soules filled with sin
chap
vj
of the misery of magistrates
that administer not true iustice
with a discourse against wicked iudges
now our discourse of courtiers being past
it is requisite that we speake of things done in the ciuill life
and to how many miseries it is subiect
for although it be at this day a degrée most noble and necessary for the peace of mans life
yet shall we find that it deserues to haue his part in this pilgrimage
as well as others
and if there be any delectation
pleasure
or honour
depending thereon
yet it is transitory and vnconstant
first
knowing that all the actions of magistrates
passe before the eyes of the common people
whose iudgements in matters of state be but simple
yet haue they a certaine smell or sauour to know the good from euill
wherefore those that be iudges and magistrates
be subiect
as in a play
to be hissed at and chased away with shame and confusion
for the hare-brained people
which is compared to a monster with many heads
are mutable
vncertaine
fraudulent
apt to wrath and mutiny
ready to prayse or dispraise
without wisedome or discretion
variable in their talke
vnlearned and obstinate
therefore it behooueth that the life of a iudge or magistrate be sincere and vertuous
for as he iudgeth openly
so shall he be iudged of the people seuerally ▪ not only in matters of waight and importance
but in those of small consequence
for alwayes the rude people will find somewhat to reforme
as the lacedemonians murmured at their law-maker licurgus
for that he went alwayes holding downe his head
the venetians defamed wise cato in his eating
and accounted pompeius vnciuill
for that he would scratch with one finger onely
yet these are but few in comparison of other good men that the common sort haue persecuted
banished
and in the end put to death
if that great oratour demosthenes were aliue
he could say some what
who after hée had a long time béene a iust and faithfull gouernour of the common-wealth of athens
was in the end
without cause
vniustly banished
moses
and many other holy men haue so many times tasted the fury of the common people
that if they were this day liuing
they would powre out most grieuous complaints against them
now we haue shewed and set foorth the miseries that procéed from common people
so must we in like sort put into the ballance the errours and corruptions that are found in wicked iudges
of the which sort some are corrupted with feare
for such feare they haue
that rather than they will displease a prince or a great lord
they wil violate iustice like pilate
that condemned christ
for feare that he had to displease the emperour tiberius
other magistrates are corrupted by loue
as was herod
who for to please the foolish loue of a damsell that danced
condemned to death saint iohn baptist
although he knew he was iust and innocent
some are many times corrupted by hatred
as was the chiefe priest
that condemned saint paul to be stoned to death
though he deserued it not
some magistrates are corrupted by siluer and gold
and other gifts and presents
as were the children of the prophet samuel
and this disease is so contagious
that i feare
at this day
many are infected with it
they all loue rewards saith the prophet
they all séeke for gifts
they doe not right to the orphane
and the widdowes complaint commeth not before them
and in an other place
woe be to you that are corrupted by money
by hatred or loue
and which iudge the good to be euill
and the euill good
making the light darkenesse
and the darkenesse light
woe be to you that haue not respect to the deserts of things
but to the deserts of men
that regard not equitie
but gifts that are giuen
that regard not iustice
but money
you are diligent in rich mens causes
but you deferre the cause of the poore
you are to them most cruell and rigorous iudges
but vnto the rich kind and tractable
the prophet ieremy cryeth out against wicked iudges
and saith
they are magnified
and become rich
they haue left the orphanes
and haue not done iustice for the poore
shall not
i therefore punish these things
saith the lord
and my soule take vengeance on such manner of people ▪ heare also the sentence that saint iames pronounceth against them at the day of iudgment
you haue condemned and killed the iust
you haue liued in wantonnesse in this world
and taken your ease
now therefore
saith the lord of hoasts
wéepe and howle in your wretchednesse that shall come vpon you
your garments are moatheaten
your gold and siluer is cankred
and the rust thereof shall be a witnesse against you
and it shall eate your flesh as it were fire
for the complaints of the poore are ascended vp to my throne
these are the complaints that the prophets and apostles made against wicked iudges and magistrates
and likewise the censures that our good god hath thundred against them
and now i will speake of the misery of marriage
with a discourse of the same
of the praise of marriage
and likewise the miseries that ensue thereon
there is no ioy nor pleasure in the world
which may bee compared to marriage
for there is such fellowship between the parties coupled
that they seeme two minds to be transformed into one
likewise both good fortune and bad
is common to both
their cares equall
and their ioyes equall
and to be briefe
all things are in common betwéene them two
if wee account it pleasure to commit our secrets to our friends and neighbours
how much greater is the ioy
when we may discouer our thoughts to her
that is ioyned to vs by such a knot of affinity
that we put as much trust in her as in our selues
making her wholly treasurer or faithfull kéeper of the secrets of our minds
what greater witnesse of feruent loue and vndissoluble amity can there be
than to forsake father
mother
sister and brother
and generally all their kindred
till they become enemy to themselues
for to follow a husband
that doth honor and reuerence her
and hauing all other things in disdaine
she onely cleaueth to him
if he be rich
she keepeth his goods
if he be poore
she is companion with him in pouerty
if he be in prosperity
his felicity is redoubled in her
if hee be in aduersity
he beareth but the one halfe of the griefe
and furthermore
she comforteth him
assisteth and serueth him
if a man will remaine solitary in his house
his wife keepeth him company
if he will goe into the fields
she conducteth him with her eye as farre as she can see him
she desireth and honoureth him
being absent
she complaineth and sigheth
and wisheth his company
being come home he is welcommed
and receiued with the best shew and tokens of loue
and for to speake truth it séemeth that a wife is a gift from heauen granted to a man
as well for the contentation of youth
as the rest and solace of age
nature can giue vs but one father
and one mother
but marriage presenteth many in our children
the which doe reuerence and honour vs
and are more deare vnto vs than our owne selues
for
being yong
they play
prattle
laugh and shew vs many pretty toyes
they prepare vs an infinit number of pleasures
and it séemeth that they are giuen vs by nature
to passe away part of our miserable life
if we be afflicted with age
they shew the duty of children
close vp one eyes
and bring vs to the earth
from whence we came
they are our bones
our flesh and blood
for in séeing them
we sée our selues
the father beholding his children
may be well assured that he séeth their liuely youth renued in their faces
in whom we are almost regenerate and borne again
in such sort
that age is most grieuous vnto vs
beholding the mirrours and similitudes of our selues
the which doth make our memories almost immortall
many are the ioyes and swéet pleasures in marriage
which for breuities sake i passe ouer
but if we do well consider it
and waigh it in a iust ballance
we shal find that amongst these roses
are many thornes growing
and amongst these swéet showers of raine
we shall find that there falleth much haile
but with reuerence now i craue pardon of all vertuous women
that with patience i may discouer my intent
and that my presumption may not gaine the least frowne from their chast browes
for to the vicious i speake
and not to them whose breasts harbours the liberall fountaine of vertue and wisdome
the athenians
being a people much commended for their prudence and wisedome
séeing that husbands and wiues could not agrée
because of an infinite number of dissensions that chanced betweene them
were constrained to ordaine certaine magistrates in their countrey
whom they called reconcilers of married ones
the office of whom was to set agreement betweene the husband and the wife
the spartanes and romanes had also such like lawes and orders amongst them
so great was the insolence and rashnes of some women towards their husbands
in this age there are but few i thinke
can beare patiently the charges of marriage
or can endure the vnbridled rage of some women
and to speake truth without flattery
if thou takest her rich
thou makest thy selfe a bondslaue
for thinking to marry thine equall
thou marriest a commanding mistresse
if thou takest her foule
thou canst not loue her
if thou takest her faire
it is an image at thy gate to bring thée company
beauty is a tower that is assayled of all the world
&amp; therefore it is a hard thing to kéep that
where euery one séeketh to haue the key
then this is the conclusion
riches causes a woman to be proud
beauty maketh her suspected
and hard fauour causeth her to be hated
therefore hyponactes hauing tasted the martyrdomes of marriage
sayed that there was but two good dayes in all the life of marriage
whereof the one was the wedding day vpon which is made good chéere
the bride fresh and faire
and of all pleasures the beginning is most delectable
the other good day is when the woman dieth
for then the husband is out of bondage and thraldome
yet for all this a woman is to man a necessary euill
and one whom he cannot well liue without
seeing that there is nothing more harder to find in this world
than a good woman
a good mule
and a good goate
who are three vnhappy beasts
and to conclude
there is nothing more lighter than a womans tongue
vnbridled
more piercing than her outragious words
more to be feared
than her boldnesse
more cruell
than her malice
nor more dangerous than her fury
besides many other hurtfull discommodities of their huswiferie
which for this time i passe ouer
and so returne to our former discourse
of the worlds generall misery
and the vices of all sorts in the communalty
of all the miseries that hapneth to man in this pilgrimage of woe
these hereafter following
are the greatest
of which nature her selfe hath complained vnto god
who saith
that man for euery uice hath a cloake of uertue to couer it
as for example
those that wound and kill one another
we call them hardy and strong
and we say that they haue a regard to honour
and therefore deserue commendation
they that violate women
and rauish uirgins
we call that bearing of loue
those that are proud
and seeke by all vnlawfull meanes to climbe vp to high dignities
we call them honourable
graue
and men of ripe iudgement
those that are couetous
and beguile their neighbours by crafty subtilties and inuentions
and so in short time become rich
those they call good husbands
and men that will séeke to liue
besides many other vices which are shadowed vnder the mantle of uertue
the which is one principall cause that so many miseries do fal vpon the world
and to speake truth
the whole earth is drowned in sinne
that it séemeth to be the sinke wherein all the wickednesse of the former age hath béen emptied
who euer saw the sin of couetousnesse more déeper rooted in the world
than at this present day
for all the cities
prouinces and kingdomes of the earth
be very shops and storehouses of couetousnesse and auarice
this is the world which the prophets did foreshew
that men ioyne house to house
and land to land
as though themselues would alone dwell vpon the earth
couetousnes is the wel spring of miseries
for from thence procéedes warre and destruction
and the great effusion of blood
with the which the earth is ouerflowne
from couetousnes procéed murders
treasons
thefts
usuries
forswearings
the corruption of witnesses
and peruerting of iudgements
from couetousnesse the tedious delayes in law
and lingering of sutes do procéed
and to be short
from thence commeth all wickednesse
this grieuous sinne is growne so familiar amongst men
that many liue without mercy
in such sort that now we may see the stréetes full of poore beggars
naked and clad with pouerty
with an infinite number of banished women
driuen out of their countries
bearing their children in their armes
wanting that which couetous men hoord vp with such cares
that they make it their god
and will rather let a poore body dye at their gates
than refresh him with food
therefore let vs now leaue these wicked men
idolaters of their treasures
with the couetous rich man mentioned in the holy scripture
and speake of an other vice which is called enuy
the malady wherewith many mindes in this new world
is grieuously afflicted
the time is now come
that the whole earth is nothing but a very place of the enuious
a vice which is the oldest of all vices
&amp; hath bin vsed in the worlds infancy
the experience thereof was approued in the first age of adam and the serpent
in abel and cain
in iacob and esau
in ioseph and his brethren
in saul and dauid
in hammon and mardocheus
the which pursued not one another for their riches
but for the enuy that the one bore to the other
but all this is nothing to the enuy which is vsed amongst men at this day
which wicked uice
not only reigneth amongst the common sort
but also amongst the higher
for when they are mounted to the top of fortunes whéele
and thinke peaceably to enioy the fauour of princes
behold sodainely the enuy of some other
conspires against them
and causeth them to be disdained
&amp; cast out of fauor
therefore i thinke there is no other meanes for to auoid enuy
but to auoid dignity and rule
the reason is
that we are the children of enuy
and he that leaueth most goods
leaueth most enuy
for this cause the elders counselled the rich
that they should not dwell neare the poore
nor the poore neare the rich
for the one are enuied for their wealth
and the other for their pouerty
here will we now leaue this grieuous sin of enuy
and a little glaunce at the ambitious pride
that reigneth amongst vs
who euer saw such excessiue pride in all estates
as we sée at this present
whereby we may well name this world
a world of glistering gold
of siluer
and ueluet
of purple
of silke
with the which we decke our bodies curiously
and haue no regard of the sins that ouerload the soules
but let vs beware that the same happen not to vs
which the prophets writ against the women of ierusalem
who reprooued their pride
their vnshamefull lookes
their rowlyng eyes
their attires
their chaines
iewels and bracelets
and other their vaineglorious fashions
it will happen to you
saith the lord of hosts
that in stead of perfumes
you shall haue stinke
in stead of curled haire
baldnesse
and the fairest yong men amongst you shall passe through the edge of the sword
and the strongest shall be slaine
and perish in the warres
many other vices could i largely discourse of
as the sinne of gluttony and drunkennes
where with the whole earth is infected
and i greatly marueile
that many vnsatiable belly-gods doe not rot and burst in the middest of their riotous excesse
that will sit bowsing in tauerns
spoiling that which might comfort many succourlesse people
and in the meane time
the poore lazarus standeth at the gate
&amp; cannot haue so much as the crummes that fall from their table
and to conclude
these wicked vices of gluttony &amp; drunkennesse hath continued vpon the earth euer since the beginning of the world
as for example
the liquorous lusting of adam and eue
was the cause that the gate of paradice was shut vp against vs
esau sold his birth-right
saint iohn baptist was slaine after herod had banquetted
n ● ah being ouercome with wine
slept with his priuy parts vncouered
and was mocked of his children
lot being drunke with wine
deflowred his owne daughters
with many other examples that i could name touching these wicked vices
which for this time i passe ouer
and now i will discourse of other miseries and calamities belonging to mans woefull pilgrimage
chap
ix
of the misery of age
and of mans death
with his resurrection
and the terrible iudgement of god at the latter day
thus after man hath waded in a sea of misery
as it were therein ouerwhelmed euen from his birth
at last
age comes créeping on
and then
when he ought to rest
griefes and dolours are renued
the heart afflicted
the braine troubled
the face withered
the body crooked
the sight dimmed
the haires falling
the téeth rotten
and
to be short
the body is then
as it were a similitude of death
for in age man is wonderfully changed
he is prompt to wrath
hard to appease
sad
couetous and suspitious
the which being well considered by the emperour augustus
said
that man
till fifty yéeres
liued in pleasure and felicity
and he that liueth longer for the most part
passeth his time in sorrow and grieuous sicknesse
death of children
losse of goods
to bury his friends
with an infinite number of other worldly troubles
so that it were better to haue their eyes closed in youth
than to liue to behold these things in their crooked age
thus after man hath sorrowed all his dayes vnder the heauy burthen of his sinnes
he is forced at last
to yeeld vnto death
yet by no meanes may he know after what manner he shall end his life
some there be that are forced to dye by hunger
others by thirst
others by fire
others by water
others by poyson
others are smoothered
others are torne in péeces by wilde beasts
others deuoured of the fowles of the ayre
others are made meate for fishes
and others for wormes
yet for all this man knoweth not his end
and when he thinketh himselfe most at rest
he sodainely perisheth
what a dreadfull sight is it to sée him lying in bed
that is oppressed with the paines of death
what shaking
and changing of all the bands of nature will he make
the féete will become cold
the face pale
the eyes hollow
the lips and mouth to retyre
the hands diminish
the tongue waxeth blacke
the téeth doth close
the breath faileth
the cold sweate appeareth by violence of sicknes
all which is a certaine token that nature is ouercome
but now when it commeth to the last gaspe
or at the sorrowfull departure that the soule makes from his habitation
all the bands of nature are broken
beside
when the diuell or wicked spirit is assured of our end
what furious assaults wil he make against our soules
to bring vs in despaire of gods mercy
it is the houre when as sathan doth his power to striue against god
for to hinder the saluation of mankind
and he is more boysterous in these latter dayes
for that hée knoweth that his time is but short
and that the end of his kingdome is at hand
and therefore he is the more inflamed
for he neuer more tormenteth those whom he doth possesse
than when he knoweth that he must depart
but now when man hath passed the bitter anguish of death
where is then become his glories
where are his pompes and triumphes
where is his voluptuousnesse and wantonnesse
where is his maiestie
excellence and holinesse
they are vanished as the shaddow
and it is chanced to them
as to the garment that the wormes haue eaten
or as the wooll that the moath hath deuoured
let vs behold man when he is in his graue
who euer saw a monster more hidious than the dead carkasse of man
behold his excellence
maiesty and dignity
couered with a lumpe of earth
here you may sée him that was chearished
reuerenced and honoured
euen to kisse his hands and féete
by a sodaine mutation
become a creature most abominable
and to them it happneth
as salomon writeth in his booke of wisedome
what hath it profited
saith he
the pride and great abundance of riches
all these things are passed
as is the arrow shot to the white
or as the smoake that is dispersed with the wind
let vs therefore now leaue the body of man resting in his graue
as in a bed for a season
and speake of his resurrection
and the iudgement of god
which was so much feared of the prophet dauid
that he prayed god not to enter into iudgement with his seruant
being dead in this world
hee must then appeare before the iudgement seate of god
with such a terrour to those that consider it well
that there is no member but trembleth
it is the day that the lord wil come like a tempest
when euery ones heart shall faile them
and all the world shall be astonied
for euen as the lightning that riseth in the east
and extendeth to the west
so shall the comming of the son of man be
tribulation then shall be so extreme and great
as the like hath not béen since the beginning of the world
till now
nor neuer shall be the like
the sun shall be darkned
and the moone shall giue no more light
the starres shall fall from heauen
and the waues of the sea shall rage
and men shall be amazed with feare
and the powers of heauen shall mooue
woe shall be in those dayes to them that are with child
and to them that giue sucke
for as it was in the dayes before the flood
they did eate and drinke
marry
and were married
euen vnto the day that noah entred into the arke
and knew nothing till the flood came and tooke them all away
so shall the comming of the lord bée
and then shall all kindreds of the earth mourne
and shall hide themselues in dennes and caues
and in the mountaines
and shall say vnto them
fall vpon vs
and hide vs from the face of him that sitteth vpon the throne
blow out the trumpet
saith the prophet ioel
that all such as dwell in the world may tremble at it
for the day of the lord commeth
and is hard at hand
a darke day
a gloomy day
yea and a stormy day
before him shall be a consuming fire
and behind him a burning flame
then the dead that are in their graues
shall rise and come forth
the bones
and the other parts shall finde out their ioynts
for to ioyne againe together with the body
that the earth hath putrified and corrupted ▪ all those that the beasts and birds of the ayre hath deuowred
all those that the sea hath swallowed vp
all those that are inuapored in the earth
and all those that the fire hath consumed
shall be reduced and brought to their former state
all the blood that theeues
pyrates
murderers
tyrants
and false iudges
haue vniustly shed
shall then appeare before the maiesty of god
so that there shall not one drop of blood be lost
from the time of abel
that was the first slaine of men
vnto the last
so that there shall not one haire perish
if the uaile of the temple did breake
the earth quake
the sunne darken and change his brightnes
for the wrong that was done to iesus christ being on the crosse
although in nothing he did offend
what countenance may then poore sinners shew
that haue offended him an innumerable times
who then shall abide the shining brightnesse of gods maiesty sitting vpon his throne of glory
it is the dreadfull houre when wicked monarchs
kings and princes
shall giue account of their vnlawfull exactions that they haue made vpon their subiects
and of the blood that they haue wrongfully spilled
it is the houre wherein merchants
and such as haue traded in the circle of the world that haue beguiled and sold by false waights and measures
shall render iust account of the least fault that they haue committed
it is the houre that couetous men and usurers
that haue beguiled some
and vndone others
shall pay themselues the cruell interests of that which they haue ill gotten
it is the houre when magistrates and wicked iudges that haue corrupted
violated
and suspended iustice
shall be countable for their corruption and iniquities
it is the very houre wherin widowes
orphants
and other afflicted persons
shal make their complaints before god
of the wrong and oppression that hath béene shewed them
it is the houre wherein the wicked shall say
repenting in themselues
troubled with horrible feare
behold these which in times past we had in derision
infamy and reproach
are now accounted amongst the children of god
whose portion is amongst the saints
it is the houre wherein many foolish and dumbe persons shall bée more happier than the wise and eloquent
many shepheards and carters shall be preferred before philosphers
many beggars before rich princes and monarches
and many simple and ignorant
before the witty and subtile

in athens you haue but tombs
we in court the bodies
you the pictures of venus &amp; the wise goddesses
we the persons &amp; the vertues
what hath a scholler found out by study
that a courtier hath not found out by practise
simple are you that think to see more at the candle snuffe
then the sunne beams
to saile further in a litle brooke
then in the maine ocean
to make a greater haruest by gleaning

where you shall meete my stuffe
pay for the cariage

i think all your stuffe are bundles of paper

a square die in a pages pocket

molus you courtiers be mad fellowes
wee silly soules are onely plodders at ergo
whose wittes are claspt vppe with our bookes
&amp; so full of learning are we at home
that we scarce know good manners when wee come abroad
cunning in nothing but in making small things great by figures
pulling on with the sweate of our studies a great shooe vpon a litle foote
burning out one candle in seeking for an other
raw wordlings in matters of substaunce passing wranglers about shadowes
criti
then is it time lost to be a scholler
we pages are politians
for looke what we heare our maisters talke of
ye determine of
where we suspect
we vndermine
and where we mislike for some perticular grudge
there we pick quarrels for a generall griefe
nothing amonge vs but in steede of good morow
what newes
wee fal from cogging at dice to cogge with states
&amp; so forward are meane men in those matters
that they wold be cocks to tread down others
before they be chickens to rise themselues
youthes are very forwarde to stroke their chins
though they haue no beardes
and to lie as lowd as hee that hath liued longest
molus these be the golden daies
criti
then be they very darke daies
for i can see no golde
molus you are grosse witted
maister courtier
criti

molus i meant times which were prophecied golden for plentie of all things
sharpnesse of wit

for that these winter nights are long
and that children delight in nothing more then to heare old wiues tales
we will beguile the time with some storie

yet may you happily finde wisdome and counsell in my white haires
phao lady nothing can content me better than a tale
neither is there any thing more necessary for mee then counsell

were you borne so faire by nature
phao no
made so faire by venus

doe you loue

take heede of that my childe

then hearken to my tale
which i hope shall be as a streight thread to leade you out of those crooked conceites
and place you in the plaine path of loue
phao i attend
syb
when i was young
as you nowe are
i speake it without boasting
i was as bewtifull
for phoebus in his godhead sought to gette my mayden head
but i
fonde wench
receiuing a benefit from aboue
began to waxe sqemishe beneath
not vnlike to asolis
which beeing made greene by heauenly droppes
shrinketh into the grounde when there fall showers
or the syrian mudde
which being made white chalk by the sunne
neuer ceaseth rolling
til it lie in the shadow
he to sweete praiers added great promises
i either desirous to make trial of his power
or willing to prolong mine owne life
caught vp my handful of sand
consenting to his suite
if i might liue as many yeares as there were graines
phoebus
for what cannot gods doe
and what for loue will they not do
graunted my petition
and then i sighe and blushe to tell the rest
i recalled my promise
phao
was not the god angry to see you vnkinde
syb
angry my boy
which was the cause that i was vnfortunate
phao what reuenge for such rigor vsed the gods
syb
none
but suffring vs to liue
and know wee are no gods
sapho
i pray tell on
syb
i will hauing receiued long life by phoebus
&amp; rare bewtie by nature
i thought all the yeere woulde haue beene may
that fresh colours would alwaies continue
that time &amp; fortune could not weare out
what gods and nature had wrought vppe
not once imagining that white and read should returne to black and yellow
the iuniper
the longer it grew
the crookedder it waxed
or that in a face without blemish
there should come wrinkles without number
i did as you do
go with my glasse
rauished with the pride of mine own bewtie
&amp; you shall do as i doe
loath to see a glasse disdaining deformitie
there was none that heard of my fault
but shunned my fauour
insomuch as i stooped for age before i tasted of youth
sure to be long liued
vncerteine to bee beloued
gentlemen that vsde to sigh from their heartes for my sweete loue
began to point with their fingers at my withered face
&amp; laughed to see the eies
out of which fire seemed to sparkle
to be suckered being old with spectacles
this causeth me to withdraw my selfe to a solitary caue
where i must leade sixe hundred yeeres in no lesse pensiuenesse of crabbed age
then grief of remembred youth
only this comfort
that being ceased to be faire
i study to be wise
wishing to be thought a graue matron
since i cannot returne to be a young maide
phao is it not possible to die before you become so old
sybilla no more possible then to returne as you are
to be so young
phao could not you settle your fancie vpon any
or would not destinie suffer it
sybilla women willinglye ascribe that to fortune
which wittingly was committed by frowardnesse
phao what will you haue me doe
sybilla take heede you do not as i did
make not too much of fading bewty
which is fair in the cradle
&amp; foul in the graue
resembling polyon
whose leaues are white in the morning
and blew before night
or anyta
which being a sweet flower at the rising of the sunne
becommeth a weede
if it be not pluckt before the setting fair faces haue no fruites
if they haue no witnesses
when you shall behold ouer this tender flesh a tough skinne
your eies which were wont to glaunce on others faces to be suncke so hollow
that you can scarce looke out of your own head
and when all your teech shall wagge as faste as your tongue
then wil you repent the time which you cannot recall
and be enforced to beare what moste you blame
loose not the pleasaunt time of your youth
then the which there is nothing swifter
nothing sweeter
bewtie is a slippery good
which decreaseth whilest it is encreasing
resembling the medler
which in the moment of his full ripenes is known to be in a rottennes
whiles you looke in the glasse
it waxeth old with time
if on the sunne parcht with heate
if on the winde
blasted with cold
a great care to keepe it
a short space to enioy it
a sodain time to loose it
be not coy
when you are courted
fortunes wings are made of times feathers
which stay not whilest one may measure them
be affable and curteous in youth
that you may be honoured in age
roses that lose their colours
keepe their sauours
and pluckt from the stalke
are put to the still
cotonea
because it boweth when the sunne riseth
is sweetest
when it is oldest
and children
which in their tender yeeres sow curtesie
shal in their declining states reap pitie
be not proud of bewties painting whose colours consume themselues
because they are bewties painting
phao i am driuen by your counsell into diuerse conceites
neither knowing how to stande
or where to fall
but to yeelde to loue is the only thing i hate
sybilla i commit you to fortune
who is like to play such prancks with you
as your tender yeeres can scarse beare
nor your greene wits vnderstand
but repaire vnto me often
and if i cannot remoue the effectes
yet i will manifest the causes
phao i goe
ready to returne for aduice
before i am resolued to aduenture
sybilla yet hearken two words
thou shalt get friendshippe by dissembling
loue by hatred
vnlesse thou perish
thou shalt perish
in digging for a stone
thou shalt reach a starre
thou shalt be hated most
because thou art loued most
thy death shal be feared &amp; wished
so much for prophecie
which nothing can preuent
and this for counsell
which thou maist follow
keepe not companie with antes
that haue winges
nor talke with any
neere the hill of a mowle
where thou smellest the sweetnesse of serpents breath
beware thou touch no parte of the bodie
be not mery among those that put buglosse in their wine
and suger in thine
if any talke of the eclipse of the sunne
say thou neuer sawest it
nourishe no conies in thy vaultes
nor swallowes in thine eues
sowe next thy vine mandrage
and euer keepe thine eares open
and thy mouth shut
thine eies vpwarde
and thy fingers downe
so shalt thou doe better then otherwise

grapes are minde glasses

chuse such words as may as many may melt her minde
honney ranckleth

loose al thy time to keepe time with her
can you sing

can you daunce
vse your legges
can you play vppon any instrument
practise your fingers to please her fancy
seeke out qualyties
if she seeme at the first cruell
be not discouraged

womenne striue

force they call it

straungers haue greene rushes

looke pale

that straines are caught aswell by stooping too low

i haue made my desire more desperate
into the neast of an alcyon no birde can enter but the alcyon

what dreames are these mileta
and can there be no trueth in dreams
yea
dreams haue their trueth
me thought i saw a stock doue or woodquist
i knowe not how to tearm it
that brought short strawes to build his neast in a tall caedar
where
whiles with his bill hee was framing his buylding
he lost as many fethers from his wings
as he laid strawes in his neast
yet scambling to catch hold to harbor in the house he had made
he sodenly fell from the bough where he stoode
and then pitifully casting vp his eies
he cried in such tearmes as i imagined as might either condemne the nature of such a tree
or the daring of such a minde
whilest he lay quaking vpon the ground
&amp; i gazing one the caeder
i might perceiue antes to breede in the rinde coueting only to hoord
&amp; caterpillers to cleaue to the leaues
labouring only to suck
which caused mo leaues to fall from the tree
then there did feathers before from the doue
me thought mileta
i sighed in my sleepe
pittying both the fortune of the bird
&amp; the misfortun of the tree but in this time quils began to bud againe in the bird
which made him looke as though he would flie vp
and then wished i that the body of the tree woulde bowe
that hee might but creepe vp the tree
then and so
hey

milet
i dreamed last night
but i hope dreames are contrary
that holding my heade ouer a sweete smoke
al my haire blazd on a bright flame
me thought ismena cast water to quench it
yet the sparks fell on my bosom
and wiping them away with my hand
i was all in a gore bloud
till one with a few fresh flowers staunched it
and so stretching my self as stif i started
it was but a dream
isme
it is a signe you shall fall in loue with hearinge faire words
water signifieth counsell
flowers death
and nothing can purge your louing humour but death
milet
you are no interpreter

harping alwaies vpon loue

i remember last night but one
i dreamed mine eie tooth was lose

it foretelleth the losse of a friende

that thou wouldest thrust out the best friend with the tatling

i was more intangled
but in the midst of my striuing
it seemed to myself gold

i filled my lap

it turned to duste
i blushed

being glad it was but a dreame

me though that walking in the sunne
i was stung with the flye tarantula
whose venom nothing can expell but the sweete consent of musicke
i tried all kinde of instruments
but found no ease
till at the last two lutes tuned in one key
so glutted my thirsting eares
that my griefe presently seased
for ioye whereof as i was clapping my handes
your ladyship called
milet
it is a signe that nothing shall asswage your loue but mariage
for such is the tying of two in wedlocke
as is the tuning of two lutes
in one key
for strikinge the stringes of the one
strawes will stirre vpon the stringes of the other
and in two mindes lincked in loue
one cannot be delighted but the other reioyceth

mee thought going by the sea side amonge pebels

beware of loue

for women hearts are such stones
which warmed by affection
cannot be coold by wisdome
fauil
i warrant you
for i neuer credit mennes words

for women are scorched somtimes with mens eies
though they had rather consume then confesse
sapho
cease your talking
for i would faine sleepe
to see if i can dreame
whether the birde hath feathers
or the antes winges

thou knowest how sweete thou hast found venus
who being

thou must needes then confesse i was most louing
enquire not the cause of my suite by questions
but preuent the effects by curtisie
make me six arrowe heads
it is giuen thee of the gods by permission to frame them to any purpose
i shall request them by praier
why lowrest thou vulcan
wilt thou haue a kisse

venus hath young thoughtes
and fresh affections
rootes haue stringes
when boughs haue no leaues
but hearken in thine eare vulcan
how saiest thou
vulc
vulcan is a god with you
when you are disposed to flatter
a right womanne
whose tongue is lyke a bees stinge
which pricketh deepest
when it is fullest of honnye
because you haue made mine eies dronk with fayre lookes
you wil set mine eares on edge with sweete words
you were woont to say that the beating of hammers made your head ake
and the smoake of the forge your eies water
and euery coale was a blocke in your way
you weepe rose water
when you aske
and spitte vineger
when you haue obteined
what would you now
with new arrowes
belike mars hath a tougher skin one his heart
or cupid a weaker arme
or venus a better courage
well venus
there is neuer a smile in your face but hath made a wrinkle in my forehead
ganymedes must fill your cuppe

you are as the fletcher

and as much as any can say
venus is a woman

venus
come cupid
receiue with thy fathers instruments
thy mothers instructions
for thou must be wise in conceite
if thou wilt be fortunate in execution
this arrow is feathered with the winges of aegitus
which neuer sleepeth for feare of his hen
the heade toucht with the stone perillus
which causeth mistruste and ielousie
shoote this
cupid
at men that haue faire wiues
which will make them rubbe the browes
when they swell in the braines
this shaft is headed with lidian steel
which striketh a deepe disdain of that which we most desire
the feathers are of turtel
but dipped in the bloud of a tigresse
draw this vp close to the head at sapho
that she may despise
where now she doates
good my boye
gall her on the side
that for phaos loue she may neuer sighe
this arrow is feathered with the phoenix winge
and headed with the eagles bill
it maketh men passionate in desires
in loue constant
and wise in conueiaunce
melting as it were their fancies into faith
this arrowe
sweete childe
and with as great ayme as thou canst
must phao be striken withall
and cry softly to thy selfe in the very loose
venus
sweete cupid mistake me not
i wil make a quiuer for that by it selfe
the fourth hath feathers of the peacocke
but glewed with the gum of the mirtle tree
headed with fine golde
and fastened with brittle chrysocoll
this shoote at daintie and coy ladies
at amiable and young nymphes
chuse no other white but women
for this will worke lyking in their mindes
but not loue affabilitie in speach
but no faith
courtly fauours
to bee mistresses ouer many
but constant to none
sighes to be fetcht from the longes
not the heart
and teares to bee wronge out with their fingers
not their eies
secrete laughing at mens pale lookes and neate attire
open reioycinge at their owne comlinesse and mens courtinge
shoote this arrowe among the thickest of them
whose bosomes lye open
because they woulde be striken with it
and seeing men tearme women iupiters fooles
women shall make men venus fooles
this shafte is leade in the head
and whose feathers are of the night rauen
a deadly and poysoned shafte
which breedeth hate onely against those which sue for loue
take heede cupid thou hitte not phao with this shafte
for then shall venus perishe
this laste is an old arrow
but newlye mended
the arrow which hitte both sapho and phao
working onely in meane mindes an aspiring to superiours
&amp; in high estates a stooping to inferiours
with this cupid i am galled my selfe
till thou haue galled phao with the other
cupid
i warrant you i will cause phao to languishe in your loue and sapho to disdaine his
venus goe
loyter not
nor mistake your shafte
now venus
hast thou plaide a cunning parte
though not curraunt
but why should venus dispute of vnlawfulnesse in loue
or faith in affection
beeing both the goddesse of loue and affection
knowing there is as litle trueth to be vsed in loue
as there is reason
no
sweete phao
venus will obtaine because she is venus
not thou ioue with thunder in thy hand
shalt take him out of my hands
i haue new arrowes now for my boy
and fresh flames
at which the gods shall tremble
if they beginne to trouble me
but i will expect the euent
and tarye for cupid at the forge

ah vnkinde venus
is this thy promise to sapho
but if i gette cuppid from thee
i my selfe will be the queene of loue
i will direct these arrowes with better aime
and conquer mine own affections
with greater modesty
venus heart shal flame
and her loue be as common as her crafte
o mileta

i will not be ashamed to confesse the cause
i loued phao mileta

how now my boy
haste thou done it
cupid
yea
and left phao rayling on venus
and cursing her name
yet stil sighing for sapho
and blasing her vertues
sapho
alas poore phao
thy extreame loue should not be requited with so meane a fortune
thy faire face deserued greater fauours
i cannot loue
venus hath hardened my heart

with a great despite of you
venus
vnhappy wag
what hast thou done
i will make thee repent it euery vaine in thy heart
sapho
venus be not collerick
cupid is mine
he hath giuen me his arrowes

you are not worthy to be the ladye of loue
that yeelde so often to the impressions of loue
immodest venus
that to satisfie the vnbrideled thoughtes of thy hearte
transgressest so farre from the staye of thine honour
howe sayest thou cupid

sapho
it is a good boy
venus
what haue we here
you the goddesse of loue
and you her sonne
cupid
i will tame that proud heart
els shall the gods say
they are not venus friendes
and as for you
sit boy
i will teach you how to run away
you shal be stript from toppe to toe
and whipt with nettles
not roses
i will set you to blowe vulcans coales
not to beare venus quiuer
i will handle you for this geare
well
i say no more
but as for the new mistresse of loue
or lady
i cry you mercie
i think you would be called a goddesse
you shall know what it is to vsurpe the name of venus
i will pull those plumes
and cause you to cast your eyes on your feete
not your feathers
your softe hayre will i turne to harde bristles
your tongue to a stinge
and those alluring eyes to vnluckynes
in which if the gods ayde me not
i will cursse the gods
sapho
venus
you are in a vaine aunswerable to your vanitie
whose highe woordes neither beecome you

but lette this suffice
i will keepe cupid in dispighte of you
and yet with the contente of the gods
venus
will you
why then we shal haue pretie gods in heauen
when you take gods prisoners on earth
before i sleepe you shall both repent
and finde what it is but to thinke vnreuerently of venus

i will direct thine arrowes better
euery rude asse shall not say he is in loue
it is a toye made for ladies

sapho
i wil wish him fortunate
this wil i do for phao
