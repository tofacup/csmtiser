as in a vine 
what is taken away by pruning from the branches 
is added unto the fruit 
so speech 
saith plutarch 
is made more piercing 
by taking away that which is superfluous 
and seneca affirms 
that instructions pointed with delight 
pierce the more sharply 
and stick the more stedfastly 
for which reasons 
in speaking of this insuing subject 
i will only present my reader with some loose pearles 
filed upon a string 
or a few skeins of fine silk 
close wound up in bottoms 
which perhaps with a good needle 
i could have flourished into a far larger work
nor need it offend any 
that i more respect the weight and benefit of the matter 
then the order of handling 
much gold for a little oare 
words and matter close and sweetly couched 
was not wont to be meanlier 
but better esteemed

there is a horrid sin spread all over this nation 
and lies lurking in the hearts of almost who not 
which hath not a second like it 
either to hinder the blessings 
or draw down the curses and judgements of god upon the whole land 
and yet men are so far from thinking it a sin 
that many 
possest with a new start-up white devil 
think it a vertue 
namely to contemn 
rob and persecute the ministers of the gospel 
who above all other men should be honoured 
respected 
and rewarded 
of this sin a few notions 
aphorismes 
or conclusions 
only i wish those whom it shall concern would hearken unto me 
as they would have god another day hearken unto them

bring glad tidings of good things 
and publish salvation

st pauls words are 
let them that labour in the word and doctrine 
if they rule well 
be accounted worthy of double honour 
1 tim 
517
if men did but consider 
that they cannot be nourished unto eternall life 
but by the milk of the word 
they would rather desire their bodies might be without souls 
then their churches without preachers 
and the devil that roaring lion 
is more afraid of such a silly cock 
a poor faithfull minister 
then all the other great beasts 
yet i tremble to think how little they are regarded

the twelve heads of israel 
as reverend and judicious doctor hall thinks 
would never have written their names in their rods so willingly 
but in hope they might be chosen to the dignity of the priesthood 
if they 
all the princes 
had not thought it an high honour 
been ambitious of the preserment 
they had never so much envied the office of aaron 
what then shall we think of this change 
is the evangelical ministration of less worth then the leviticall 
whiles the testament is better 
is the service worse 
how is it that the great think themselves too good for this imployment 
how is it that under the gospel 
men are disparaged with that which honoured them under the law 
that their ambition and our scorn should meet in one subject
5 
in jeroboams time 
the lowest of the people were made priests 
whom they resemble that make tradesmen their ministers 
and now priests  made the lowest of the people 
in all things the minister is held the nest of the parish 
till it comes to any tax or payment 
and then they
will honour him so farre 
as to rank him with an alderman 
and what is the issue 
they that would study divinity above all other arts 
when they look upon the contempt 
beggery 
and vexation that the ministry undergo 
turn to law 
physick 
trades 
or any thing 
rather then they will enter into this contemptible calling
but o the sordidness of such 
who think the term minister contemptible 
when even christ himself 
who must save them 
if ever they be saved 
cals himself a minister 
matth

but let them mock on 
like those ill-bred children to the prophet 
2 king 
223 
24 
isaac shall be heir 
when ishmael shall be turned out of doors 
for as 
he that despiseth the poor 
either in estate 
or impotency of minde or body 
despiseth god that made him 
prov 
175 
so he that despiseth a man for being a minister 
or for the graces of god appearing in him 
despiseth 
and almost despighteth christ himself 
and the very spirit of god which made him so
6 
but secondly 
they not only slight their function 
but they rob them of their maintenance 
and that two wales 
first 
their patrons 
sacrilegious and atheisticall impropriators 
rob them 
perhaps of three parts of their livelihood 
in carrying away the principall tithes 
for they have no more right thereunto 
then to the cloak on my back 
nor is this all 
for many a cursed patron 
and pattern of atheisme 
holds a benifice vacant in his hands 
till he hath sounded many chapmen 
with a who gives more 
and then if balaams asse can but dung him silver enough 
he will sell him all the souls in the parish 
for he looks more to the gifts of the hand 
then to the gifts of the heart 
and had rather lose his inheritance in heaven 
then let christ have his inheritance on earth
i need not tell you 
that when judas is the patron 
simon magus must be the priest 
or if the patron be a formalist 
or good fellow 
so must his chaplain be 
if the chaplain be papisticall or atheisticall 
his clark must be so too 
at least if the minister be conformable and learned 
it matters not though he be lewd 
but let me give you this hint 
that judas with his quid vos dabitis mihi on the one side 
and simon magus with his quid ego tibi dabe on the other side 
make wicked bargains together 
that such patrons as for lucre betray christs flocks into the hands of jeroboams priests 
make as good bargains as judas did 
in selling his master to the high priests for thirty pieces of silver 
indeed one would think that judas his halter should make them afraid of judas his question 
or that all such patrons and priests 
should be whip out of gods house 
which were happy for the whole nation 
though it were by far too small a punishment 
for certainly 
if the buyers and sellers in the temple 
deserved whipping 
the buyers and sellers of the temple deserve hanging 
or worse 
as who knows whether they therefore scape correction here 
that they may have the greater damnation hereafter
7 
true 
while they are drunk with avarice 
and out of their wits with an ignorant partiality 
they will maintain 
and would fain perswade their consciences to think 
that they have a right to the churches maintenance 
they gave good mony for it 
or they had it from their ancestors 
and they take but what the law allows 
that is 
what their law 
not what the gospel alows 
or the ancient laws of this land 
and yet they hope not to be saved by the law but by the gospel 
and let me but appeal 
as bishop grostead did 
from pope adrian private 
to pope adrian publick 
and not interested in the cause 
or as another 
from his passion as clement 
to his holinesse as peter 
even from them drunk 
unto them come to themselves 
which will be at least upon their death beds 
or in hell 
they will see it to be a cursed sacriledge 
the worst of all thefts or murthers 
and that it were far better for christ to have his inheritance in his own hands 
then to stand to their courtesies 
who had rather there were no gospel 
nor preacher in the world 
then that their heir should want a parsonage 
but now 
the melody of gain whistles out the eye of conscience 
so they lavish it out on their lusts 
as how often doth the impropriator 
some upstart gallant 
newly come to age 
wear a church upon his back 
and the bells at his heels gingling 
while the minister whom he robs 
is forced to go in a thredbare coat 
and the poor flock are starved in the country 
so that the father most unjustly 
with the spoils of christ 
purchaseth fields of bloud 
that the son may belteshazzar like 
drink carowses in the bowls of the temple 
but what is the issue 
they that swollow churches 
like dogs that eat knotgrasse 
never thrive after it 
yea church livings have been more unfortunate to the gentry of england 
then was the gold of tholossa to the followers of scipio
8 
again secondly 
as the minister is rob'd by his patron 
so he is gulled by his people 
who if they can avoid it 
will pay him nothing 
or if there be no remedy 
will give him the worst of their younglings 
and that by the halves 
the people in moses time brought so much treasury 
and so many gifts to the building of gods tabernacle 
that the priests were fain to bid them cease 
exod

7 
but men are now so sparing of their pains and cost 
that they think that very time mispent which is imployed in the service of god 
and that money ill bestowed 
which is given to the maintenance of his ministers 
they use preachers 
in case they like them 
as carriers do their horses 
who lay heavy burthens upon their backs 
and then hang bells at their ears to make them musick 
or rather 
as gentlemen use post horses 
whom they spur till they are spent 
and then a fresh is called for 
mean while they sit still 
and think to go to heaven by giving them the hearing 
which commonly is all they give them
it it satans policie 
that they that maintain the truth 
should not have to maintain themselves 
and it is the pride of this sacrilegious age 
that the minister be alwaies the poorest in the parish 
they empty their books
they empty their veins 
they empty their brains 
but they must feed upon turnips 
and leave their posterity beggers 
perhaps they will give a minister great thanks 
and if he be a witty man 
that tickles their ears 
and pleaseth their sense 
they will extoll him to the skies 
but men cannot camelion like 
live by the ayre of thanks 
or feed ever the fatter for others praises
9 
nehemiah complained 
that in his time 
the levites for want of maintenance 
were fain to leave the temple 
and follow the plow 
nehem 
1310 
and luther of his age 
that this was the cause 
why the unconscionable of the clergy beat their brains 
and set their wits upon the tenters to invent such tricks of superstition 
as might be advantagious to them 
prayer for the dead 
indulgences 
&ampc 
for 
saith he 
when the covetousness of the priests 
and the ignorance of the peeple joyned together 
then they invented purgatory 
masses 
prayer for the dead 
works of supererrogation 
selling of pardons 
and all their other trinkets 
for if they had not held our forefathers in ignorance 
keeping them from the word 
they would never have been papists but when they cast a mist before the eyes of all the people 
then the blinde fell into that ditch 
which doth contain so many gross corruptions 
and you cannot but observe 
that they are coffer doctrines 
that rome is most violent to justifie 
masses 
which bring in masses of wealth 
praying for the dead 
which is a trick to prey upon the living 
and so of selling pardons 
&ampc 
yea what is the reason they forbid marriage 
and commend vowes of chastity 
but that they may with the more colour allow of stews 
and have large fees out of harlots hiers
10 
all which miscarriages 
even of the antichristian priests 
had been prevented 
if the people would have afforded them 
either plentifull 
or indeed sufficient maintenance 
learning would have more plentifull allowance 
then other petty employments 
or else it is in danger to be mischievous 
for 
if you observe it 
where wit and poverty meet 
they seldom make up an honest man 
as what was the reason 
that so many serpentine preachers of the prelaticall faction 
were so eagerly driving towards popery 
untill their mouthes were gag'd 
their arms shortned 
and their horns broken by the parliament 
but because popery is a trade 
whereby they might become exceeding rich 
yea their fingers itcht 
and their teeth watered after those great revenues that are conferred upon the popish clergy 
and which their covetousness and craft hath gained them 
o that they had had no such inducement 
or that 
since they have shewn themselves so mercenary 
and unfaithfull to him that put them in trust 
they were all so served 
the bishops for their own ends brought them into the church the lord of his mercy cast them out 
i mean all 
as he hath already done some 
that they may never return again 
for if these antichristian preachers be suffered 
its impossible that ever the church 
or mens lives should be reformed 
well may they obstruct and hinder all that tends thereto
yet neverthelesse 
against reason 
and all this experience 
even in these
dayes of gospel-light 
and so much means of grace 
they hold it as an axiome 
that to keep ministers poor 
is the only way to make them study 
therefore they must be dieted like horses for a race 
not pampered 
a fat bird 
say they 
will not sing 
a fat dog cannot hunt
11 
men will have a care 
that ministers shall not be both wealthy and faithfull 
rich and not true 
or true and not rich 
both together were a miracle 
whiles we had leaden priests 
we pay'd golden tythes 
and were then perswaded 
that blasphemy and drunkennesse were tollerable sins in respect of sacriledge 
but now 
those that in our consciences teach us the true way to blessedness 
we think unworthy the worst of what we have 
to advance superstitious fopperies 
the ignorant and superstitious think nothing too much 
wicked athalia and her children 
brake up the house of god 
and all the things that were dedicated for his service 
they bestowed upon balim 
2 cron 
247 
gods prophets were glad of bread and water 
whiles jezabels four hundred trencher-chaplains 
were fed as daintily as the king himself 
should we have superstitious and idolatrous priests 
as in rome and italy 
that more aym at the churches goods 
then the churches good 
at their own benefit more then the peoples profit 
it were easie for them 
to purchase both mens praises and purses 
whereas every penny they part with 
to a faithfull and painfull pastor 
is drawn from them 
as so many drops of bloud from the heart 
as o the difference between these sunshine dayes of the gospel 
and the darkness of our forefathers times 
when even the comfortable use of the very bible was interdicted them 
the known language concealed 
and they bound with a curse not to read it 
whereas now 
it lyes open in our churches 
in out windowes 
god grant we shut it not to our own souls 
which is mightily to be feared 
if we cannot be at the least cost for our religion 
if we can be content to do god chargeless service
12 
it was gain that made diana so great 
and demetrius to roar and make such a tumultuous stir for her 
its far otherwise with our ministers 
they beat their brains 
and spend their spirits 
pour out their prayers 
plot and contrive all they can to save our poor souls 
which being our case 
what cause have we to fear the removall of our candlestick 
and that god should leave us in the dark 
since we love darkness more then light 
and to take away our faithfull ministers from us 
when we so ill intreat them 
and so unworthily reward them 
if we presume to cosen god 
to purloyn the maintenance of his ministers 
is not this to point god the way to plague us 
and to send upon us a famine of preaching 
who have brought a famine upon the preachers 
is it not just with god 
to take away the lamp from that nation 
which hath taken away the holy oyl that should maintain it 
and lord i fear that england shall want the gospel 
when the barbarians receive it 
because england had the gospel 
and would not give a peny 
more then forc't unto 
to keep it
13 
and this 
whatever carnall hearts conceive of it 
were a greater judgement 
then the loss of the sun out of the firmament 
a famine of bread is a sore plague 
when a wofull mother 
for her self and son 
is dressing their last provision 
the extremity harder 
when mothers by turns cat up their own children 
as it fell out

but this was nothing to a dearth of the word 
even seneca an heathen could say 
it is better not to be 
then not to know 
better unborn then untaught 
which if true of humane knowledge 
how much more of the divine and supernaturall knowledge of the gospel 
for this is life eternall 
to know the only true god 
and jesus christ whom he hath sent 
john 173 
and look to it my brethren 
least you rob your selves and your posterity to the worlds end 
of injoying this matchless mercy 
this unparralleld pearl
you indeed set a low price upon it 
and thereafter deal with the publishers of it 
but o what large bribes would satan give to have such men hold their peace 
if they were of some great lawyers minde 
yea i dare say 
his servant the pope would give them more to be silent 
then you will willingly give them for all their pains in preaching
14 
magistrates are the arms of the world 
counsellors the brains 
lawyers the tongues 
the rich the stomacks 
the poor the backs 
merchants the feet 
officers the hands 
and divines the hearts 
god made thee 
thy preacher 
as a coworker together with god 
saves thee 
where is another equivalent to god and his ambassador 
and yet as if god and his minister had nothing to do with us 
and nothing had done for us 
there is none whom we so boldly defraud 
our best things should not be too dear for the lord 
whose both they and our selves are 
and those that sight for our souls 
against spirituall powers 
may challenge maintenance from us 
and it is a shamefull unthankfulness to deny it 
nor do ministers more take pains then they pray for us 
they beg and dig 
and dig and beg 
as that good vine-dresser did 
whose mattock kept off the masters ax 
luk 
138 
9 
besides 
he can never be truly thankfull to god 
who is unthankfull to the means 
by whom god doth him good
15 
when abraham had vanquished the five kings 
and delivered lot and his family 
the king of salem met him with bread and wine 
but we reward our champions 
that stand in the gap to defend us 
as the jews did christ 
they give us wine 
and we return them vinegar 
for either we traduce 
and speak evil of them 
as absolom did of his own father 
2 sam 
153 
or we unjustly accuse them 
to get away their livings 
as false ziba did honest mephibosheth 
or like mules 
we suck their milk 
and then kick them with our heels 
which is to outdo mischief it self 
yea sometimes it fares with them 
as it did with the two milch kine that carried the ark of god back from the philistines to bethshemish 
that were for their labour burnt in sacrifice 
as soon as they had done that good office 
1 sam 
614
16 
but fare they well or ill 
they go on in discharge of their duty 
which proves them to be like the apostles of christ 
who though they were beaten for preaching in the name of jesus 
yet ceased they not to teach and preach the gospel 
and to win all they could 
act 
542 
indeed some there are that will square cut their positions 
according to their peoples dispositions 
as not daring to speak to the full extent of their consciences 
for fear least by displeasing their auditory 
they should lose their salary 
nor dare they reprove great mens particular sins 
because such an attempt would bring them into contempt 
but how unlike are such messengers to eliah 
in his personall dealing with ahab 
to elisha 
about jehoram 
jeremiah 
with pashur 
amos 
with amaziah 
john baptist 
with herod 
our saviour 
with the scribes and pharisees 
steven 
with the high priests and elders 
yea st paul with peter his fellow apostle 
and with elymas the sorcerer 
most of them mighty and potent
and most pitifull is the case of such a people 
whose sins are so connived at 
except conscience makes a supply 
which were extraordinary 
indeed if that be awake it will fear no man 
but dares check a magistrate 
controul a prince and admit it may sometimes slumber 
as no woman is alwaies scolding 
yet when it wakes 
it will speak and speak home
17 
but i speak not of those trencher chaplains 
who out of coveteousnesse and for want of courage 
betray the truth 
who are more carefull for their own profit and quiet 
then of the peoples good 
or gods glory 
for these were never sent of god 
and it's meet their wages should be according to their work 
and yet i would rather erre in giving a wolf his due 
if he be appointed my pastor 
then in the least detain from a faithfull shepherd what of right belongs to him
but i tell you of such as fear god 
and are of his sending 
who think it better to lose mens favours then their souls 
and will be sure to discharge their consciences from the burthen of any ones bloud 
as gods glory will make a good man speak 
even when terrour it self hath commanded silence
a conscionable minister resembles david 
who would venture on a bear 
rather then lose a lamb 
and jacob 
who would endure heat by day 
and frost by night 
rather then neglect his flocks 
and moses 
who would fight with odds 
rather then the cattell should perish with thirst 
only a balaam wants this mercy
18 
and what though men remain obstinate for a time 
when wood is green 
it will not presently burn 
yet if it be long blown 
it will take fire 
and flame at length 
or admit the worst 
yet he will not be silent 
good meat put into a stomack corrupt 
feavourish 
or hydropicall 
doth not more nourish nature 
then the disease 
yet we do not thereupon forbear utterly to give them meat 
but rather strive to purge out those bad humours which cause the offence 
the lord by his ministers 
gives every
of us light 
let us beseech him also for clear and sound eyes 
that we may finde benefit 
and take comfort in the light he hath given us
19 
i grant 
that in speaking of this sinfull sin of sacriledge 
even the most conscientious and faithfull ministers are too sparing 
not for that sacriledge scorns to be reprehended 
nor for that he is taxed of indiscretion that meddles with it 
but that it may appear they least of all seek themselves 
and for that they should thereby so prejudice their hearers 
that they would little regard what ever else they do deliver 
for such is the sottishness and sordidness of most men 
which makes me the rather speak 
neither let any of these godhaters 
rom 
130 
blaspheam the ministry for what i have or shall speak 
for i am no minister 
nor have i any particular relation to the ministry 
so that self-interest can bear no sway with me 
i only speak my conscience 
as it is informed from the word 
and to me it represents it self 
as the most unjust 
unreasonable 
ingratefull 
abominable and prejudiciall sin to our selves 
of all other sins
20 
1 
most unjust for we partake of the preachers goods 
they bring us the glad tidings of salvation 
would furnish and endow us with the spirituall 
unvaluable 
and lasting riches of grace and glory 
and shall not they partake of our goods 
that are inferiour 
earthly and perishing 
let him that is taught in the word 
communicate unto him that teacheth 
in all his goods 
sayes the apostlegal 
66 
none but those 
who would give sinne a pasport to offend 
can deny this to be new testament 
and to be most just and equall 
yet to go home to that place 
or to bring that place close home to mens consciences 
would appear harsh 
in these times of gospel light 
or new-lights as they call them 
if any man does not communicate 
and communicate in all bis goods 
god is not mockt 
gal 
67 
so it falls 
and i fear it falls heavy on many amongst us 
again 
saith the same apostle 
if we have sowen unto you spirituall things 
is it a great thing if we reap yiur carnall things 
1 cor 
911 
do ye not know 
that they which minister about holy things 
live of the things of the temple 
and they which wait at the altar 
are partakers with the altar 
even so hath the lord ordained 
that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel 
ver 
13 
14 
he useth many other arguments in the same chapter 
that he may meet with mens carnal reasonings in this case 
as 
who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges 
who feedeth a flock 
and eateth not of the milk of the flock 
and the like 
the which reade at your leisure 
and in rom 
15 
their debtors they are 
which proves it not a benevolence or free gift 
for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things 
their duty it also to minister unto them in carnal things 
ver 
27 
the apostle calls it a debt 
and tells us it is our duty 
observe that 
all which is new testamens 
if obstinacy would suffer men to take notice of it 
but our pharisees are worse then the pharisces of old 
for what saith one of the worst of them 
i pay tythes of all that i have 
i should have thought he had lied 
but that our saviour justifies him 
even to mint and
cummin 
a pharisce of jerusalem 
was in this an honest man 
to many citizens of london yet that pharisee went to hell 
in all probability
21 
yea a minister 
must not require those dues that are acknowledged 
though perhaps those dues will not maintain him 
but he is too strict 
especially of the meaner sort 
and yet sometimes 
and in some cases 
in losing his right 
he shall wrong and do prejudiee to other pastors that live about him 
and those likewise that shall succeed and come after him in his living 
yea foster his people in that fond conceit 
of thinking their labour and ministry so little worth 
which ought to be stood upon 
aristippus the philosopher would take money of his friends 
though he car'd not for it 
to teach them that it was his due 
and how they ought to esteem of the riches of the minde
fourthly 
why should ministers more then other men 
take a testern for a shilling 
when themselves that make the objection 
will not think it fair dealing from their debtors 
but take their full due 
and think it neither breach of justice 
piety or charity 
why then should they impose the same upon others
fiftly 
admit he take his full due of a poor body 
the poorest of all have souls 
and i see not 
but as the poor may count it a happiness that they may have their mite accepted 
so that the minister in giving to the poor 
should have the same liberty that all men have 
viz 
to bestow it where he pleaseth 
and where he thinks it will be best bestowed 
briefly 
if men would have ministers de jure cedere 
they should also learn jus reddere 
but
22

as it is most unjust 
so it is most unreasonable 
men would have fire kept in the sanctuary 
but allow no fuel 
they would have the lamp burn 
but without oyl 
and how do they serve christ and themselves in so serving their ministers 
to take away the prvant from the army 
is to betray it to the enemy 
and simple souls 
they do no less to their power 
then split or sink that ship in the midst of the sea 
which alone should save them 
sacriledge is the greatest theft 
yet of it men make the least conscience
the merchant provides bravery for our backs 
the farmer food for our bellies 
the lawyer looks to our estates 
the physitian to our bodies 
but th divine saveth our souls 
which is infinitely beyond all 
for saith christ in the gospel 
is not the life more worth then the meat 
and the body then rayment 
and the soul more pretious then all 
and yet men envy not the prodigious wealth of merchants 
of lawyers 
of any 
but they cannot hear of a minister that hath a tithe of their means 
but their hearts and splenes rise at it 
yea this upon the point is the only conference 
or parly 
both in publick and private 
how to decrease the ministers maintenance 
and yet increase his work 
which is like pharaohs oppressing gods people

but what say they 
though we give them not so much as they would have 
yet we give them sufficient 
though not at does

he that works with us by the day 
we say is worthy of his wages 
we do not call it a benevolence 
nor will the lawyer or physitian give you thanks 
though you tender unto them a more considerable fee 
but for asking of aquestion 
and are divines slaves in comparison of all other men

and but seriously consider of them
24 
but admit the ones humility should satisfie the others pride 
and take what they think sufficient for minister 
and that as a benevolence 
or free gift 
and not as their own proper dues 
what is it they call sufficient 
and what is their great benevolence 
of which they are apt to boast 
and for which they count him their servant 
as their very children 
by bearing their parents discourse 
can in the school thus twit their ministers children 
your father is but our fathers servant 
they maintain him 
&ampc 
which to hear 
though from foolish children 
would make any good 
or ingenuous mans bloud to rise
their contribution is even such 
as i am ashamed to name 
nor can i with patience once think of it 
perhaps the father of such a childe gives to the minister or lecturer 
if he be worth five hundred pounds 
three pence a quarter 
as he gives to the bclman 
for labouring all the year like a horse
in parishes that i could name 
of late times 
it's mostly left to every mans choise 
the more shame and pity 
what he will give to the minister 
and what do they give 
not one in ten gives any thing 
though many of them no mean ones 
yea some forsooth pretend conscience for their robbing the minister 
he hath taken degrees 
is ordained 
is a blackcoat 
a presbyterian 
an independent 
will not indifferently administer the sacrament 
nor give it men at home when they are sick 
as in former times 
he had not their voice 
nor consent when he was chosen 
or they do not like his preaching 
or he is a roundhead 
or i am of another church 
or i hear at other churches 
or i cannot edefie by his preaching 
or he preaches the law 
and therefore is a raylor 
or the like 
of the rest 
the greater part give eight pence 
twelve pence 
or sixteen pence a year 
and of those that give two shillings 
four shillings or more 
there are not very many 
though great parishes 
and the ministers 
both learned 
godly and deserving 
so that in parishes where were 6 or 10 thousand communicants in
the bishops time 
there can scarce be collected clear to the minister threescore pounds per annum 
to maintain him 
his wife and family 
and to provide portions for his children
25 
and as for the country 
how many whole parishes be there in the land 
yea how many hundreds 
that suffer their faithfull and painfull minister 
who lies ledger for the great king of heaven and earth 
to feed upon crusts 
and spin out twenty or fourty marks a year 
into a thred as long as his life 
or if in other parishes they allow their minister more 
is that more 
if they can help it 
any more then a mean mechanick will get 
with keeping two apprentises 
and a journeyman 
though he play himself 
or will their great benevolence afford a laborious bee 
books enough to furnish his study 
and breed his children as were fit 
or provide them portions
or if so 
whereas men of other professions 
whether attorneys 
shopkeepers 
aledrapers 
&ampc 
not to name the richest 
as courtiers 
lawyers 
merchants 
think it a small matter 
to get two or three hundred pounds a year 
and leave their children five hundred or a thousand pounds apiece to their portions 
it is counted a mighty business 
if a minister hath an hundred 
or sixscore pounds a year 
which will not comfortably maintain his charge 
and afford him to do that good 
which every one expects a minister should do 
have he never so little
yea a player 
fidler 
or dauncer is better maintained then a preacher 
and as if the better part were least to be cared for 
men could be content 
if need were 
to bestow more upon a licence to eat flesh in lent 
then upon their souls all the year 
yea many mens shoeties cost them more in a year 
then god and their souls 
and doth not all this speak men most brutish and irrationall 
yea impious and ungratefull 
as god forbid men should profit so little by their minister 
as their minister profits by them
26 
and yet they have some peece of reason for it 
for their blockish stupidity is such 
that they think none live more idely then scholars 
yea doubtless they think ministers can preach without study as the apostles did 
or live by miracle as john baptist did 
mistake me not 
i have no minde to meddle with that perverse generation 
that are so drunk with an opinion of the spirit 
and such enemies to learning 
and pains in study 
that they barrowcado their hearts 
not only against the admitment of what any one of another judgement can attedge 
but even against common sense 
though these also are of the others judgement 
and that in the extreme 
for these hold 
yea will maintain 
that a cobler may sit at his work all the week 
and yet preach two better sermons upon the lords day ex tempore 
then the best scholar can do 
that spends himself in his library 
alledging the apostles for their warrant 
and yet could i hear fishermen or the like 
write and preach like the apostles 
and likewise speak all languages by the spirit as they did 
who of no scholars were suddenly changed into greater scholars and better orators then ever the world bred up in the best ʋniversities 
i
would see if i could prevail with my understanding 
to submit to their judgements 
in the mean time i say 
of all men in the world 
i mean not to meddle with them 
and i should be as sorry to have them meddle with me 
and therein also my hope is depending 
for like that horse sent to dr butler in cambridge 
they care not for books 
yea they will allow of no books to be read but the bible 
wherein by consequence 
they condemn all preaching 
so having a little stept out of my way 
to meet with our enthusiasts 
as once a grave divine stept out of his text 
to meet with king james about his swearing 
i return to the parties with whom my business lies
27 
men envy not the prodigious wealth of merchants 
lawyers 
courtiers 
but they cannot hear of a minister 
that hath a tythe of their means 
but their hearts and splenes rise at it

as that paul told philemon 
thou owest unto me 
even thine own self

19

yea even as christ jesus 
and to pleasure him

and in case he seeks to mend himself 
by accepting of better means 
they will make it such a hainous matter 
as if he had stolen a horse 
or as if he had forsaken his lawfull wife 
and married another woman 
as it 
would amaze a man to hear 
how confidently these blocks will maintain 
that a minister in this case 
cannot with a good conscience forsake his people 
yea though his aym and end be principally the glory of god 
as when all 
or most in the parish 
blinde themselves with prejudice against him 
and even stop their ears against whatsoever truth he delivers 
resolving against their own conversion 
if he shall remove to another people 
that will receive him as the galathians did paul 
and help them to another whom they far more respect 
and whose ministry is more likely to do good upon them 
they will most basely calumniate him 
and not he alone shall suffer 
but all these churchmen say they 
are so covetous 
that they never think they have enough 
and what hospitality do they keep 
when they have scarce enough to fill the bellies of their own families 
all which not only argues them as brainless as beasts 
but proves them to be as full of the serpents enmity 
as the egge of a cockatrice is full of poyson 
but

as it is most unjust and unreasonable 
so it is the most abominable in gods sight of all other sins
how abominable it is 
we may partly gather from the many complaints
and threatnings which god throughout all the old testament utters for the robbing him of his tythes 
offerings

what is the root and spring of this their spight and enmity to the ministry 
but an inbred enmity and hatred against god himself 
as when satan slew jobs sons and servants 
his malice was against job 
or as when saul darted a spear at jonathan 
his spight was against david 
he that loves not the members 
was never a friend to the head

many such places i might alledge if i would be large
if men honoured christ they could not dispise his ministers 
his ambassadors 
if they despise his ministers they do not honour christ 
and if they do not honour him he will never honour them 
but it appears 
that too-many value not their minister so much as they do their horse 
which is a sign of a desperate condition 
when homer had spent many lines in dispraising the body of thersites 
he briefly describes his soul thus 
that he was an enemy to ulysses 
and we need say no more of a bad man 
then he is an enemy to his pastor 
that is enough to brand him

it is not more unjust

by these places you may see 
that if god be to be trusted 
the only way to abound in all things 
and to have them blest unto us 
is to pay the lord his dues 
whereas from them that will not pay the tenth 
or a considerable part 
he takes away 
if not all the other nine 
yet so much as may make us no small loosers 
a case worth the considering of all that study to be rich 
nor is it possible with words to expresse the truth of a thing more clearly 
fully 
and plainly 
then the lord hath delivered himself to us in the fore-mentioned scriptures touching this point
33 
there was a gentleman 
well known and observed by many ministers 
and other consciencious christians in this land 
that had the tythes of a parsonage impropriate 
by right whereof he demanded tythe wool of a parishioner who was very rich 
and the owner of many hundred sheep 
he sent him a very small quantity 
the servants shewed it their master 
the master his neighbours 
who all acknowledged that he did him wrong 
he demanded more 
the other denied to give more 
and vowed in his choler 
that if he were driven to pay more 
he would never keep sheep again 
and so deprive him of that profit 
the law compelled him 
whereupon he put away his sheep 
after which he presently fell into such decay 
that when this gentleman was burried 
which was not long after 
he among the rest of the poor
people 
stood to receive such almes as were given at the funerall 
and this my self can say out of experience 
that in serving the commonwealth when time was 
i gained in a lawfull way many hundreds a year 
but being unthankfull 
and not once intending to glorifie god with my substance 
what i got 
god did blow upon 
and it was put into a bag with holes 
as the holy ghost speaks 
hag 
16

for my estate rather lessened 
then encreased 
untill amongst other things 
i indented with my self 
to make conscience of sanctifying the sabbath 
and to return to the giver 
as he should direct 
the tythe of what i then was 
or ever after should be able to expend 
whereupon i found such a sudden change 
and that god did so blesse and prosper me 
that it appeared miraculous 
for no reason could i give of this his mercy 
but his mercy and o the depth 
nor was this the one half 
for as in a short time 
the lord framed my estate to my minde 
which made me leave off all publike employment 
he hath ever since so framed my minde to my estate and present condition 
which amounts to more then all the millions this world is worth 
that i think i may speak it without vanity 
there is not a man alive more brimfull of joy and content 
i know i shall be counted a fool for this 
but if it may be an inducement to others 
to trust god 
or at least to try him 
in making conscience of this foul and consuming sin 
it shall never trouble me 
it is a happy loss that makes god and his church gainers
34 
i will take leave to close this discourse with a double sute 
one to the people in generall 
the other to supream authority 
both which shall come from an heart unfainedly devoted to the common good
my suit to the first of these is 
that what hath been spoken may be an inducement to all that have any fear of god 
or love of their own souls 
to try the success of paying to ministers their due 
i speak not to the prophane 
for who can wonder that those men disregard their ministers that have cast off all respect of god and their own souls 
neither do i need to presse such whose hearts are changed by the power of their pastors preaching 
for great is the affection of a convert 
to the ministry which hath been the means of his conversion 
he accounts his very eyes but a mean recompence for so great a benefit 
gal 
415 yea 
our debt and duty to our spiritual pastors is such 
as that paul told philemon 
thou owest unto me even thine own self 
and the primitive times prove it 
insomuch that luther sayes 
so soon as the gospel took root in mens hearts 
and after when it revived again 
money grew dead 
the glad tydings of the gospel 
was so sweet to them 
that in comparison 
riches had no rellish
35 
i speak not unto these 
i say 
but to such as have not hitherto made conscience of this duty 
and all such i beseech as they tender the good of their estates here 
and their souls hereafter 
to take gods word 
as what heart is able to stand out 
when he hears and considers what the lord speaks

count it not lost 
what you give to your pastor 
think it not gotten what you gull him of 
give him not the starvelings of your breed 
the best of all kindes 
is it to be consecrated to the lord of all 
every thing we have is too good for us 
if we think any thing we have too good for him

why is this waste 
but with david 
i will not offer to the lord of that which cost me nothing

and by maintaining your pastors body 
he is inabled the better to feed your souls 
when the lamp is not fed with oyl 
there will be but a dark house 
yea admit your minister growes old 
and be no longer able 
or fit to feed your souls with spirituall manna 
cast him not off 
but maintain him and his charge 
according to his former pains and deserving 
yea 
let not his wife and children want 
though he be dead 
occasion not the world 
to laugh at the minister 
or his 
when they come to beg a straw of their own sheaf 
the levite might not serve after fifty 
what then 
must he lose his maintenance 
no 
he had the same provision still 
a man will not cast off his dog being old 
because he hath a long time done him service
37 
secondly 
my sure to soveraign authority is 
that they will provide the ministry may be so maintained 
if not by the name of tythes 
which name only is made a colour to cosen the clergy of all 
yet at least in some other way 
that they may live comfortably 
without carking or caring what they shall do 
and where they shall get their bread 
when their own temporall means is gone 
the lord hath committed the souls of magistrates to their ministers 
but the bodies of minsters to the magistrates 
and indeed what should become of the levites 
if there were not laws 
and what of the church if there were no levites
38 
and so much of contemning and robbing christs ambassadours of the ministry 
which is enough to prove 
that millions who think they love god 
do indeed 
and in good earnest hate him 
for our love to god is best known by our respect to 
and usage of his messengers 
of wronging and persecuting them in their persons and good names 
which follows in the transcribed copy 
together with the residue of englands sinne and unthank fulness 
when the stationer shall be encouraged by the acceptance that these finde 
which are already done 
to print the whole in a larger character 
which may well be doubted 
in that men are so taken up with news and controversie 
a 
new trick of the devils 
that few read profitable divinity 
or if so 
not many can hear these downright truths 
but they must also hear the sentence of their own condemnation 
wherefore for the interim 
if any out of a publike spirit 
would have many of these without cost 
to distribute to whom they concern
