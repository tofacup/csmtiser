my lord
i have presumed on this dedication 
upon a three-fold account 
1 
in reference to the reverend author 
2 
from reflections upon my self 
3 
and especially with respect unto the subject matter of the treatise
1 
the author 
when obscure and scarcely known by persons of honour 
being necessitated to ly hid in a corner 
by reason of prelaticall persecution 
was owned 
approved 
and honoured by your lordship 
for his high parts 
and eminent piety 
being a learned 
well-studied 
self-denying orthodox divine 
zelous of gods truth 
then maligned 
studious of the churches peace then disturbed 
and very able to appear an advocate for both 
by strenuous disputation 
in this regard 
my lord 
i am confident you will not be offended 
finding your name prefixed before the work of this worthy man
2 
as for my worthless self 
i have for many years been looked upon 
not only as related unto your lordship in publique service
when you sincerely improved and adventured your person 
your interest 
your all 
for religion and englands liberties 
but also obliged by manifold testimonies of respect 
both then 
and since received 
and upon the remembrance hereof 
i judg it my duty 
so to declare my gratitude and honourable respects unto your lordship 
that this testimony hereof 
may abide 
when my body is laid in the dust
3 
the subject matter of this book 
is that which hath principally prevailed with me 
to present it unto your lordships patronage 
because true godliness 
in the doctrine and practice of it 
hath been 
and still is 
befriended by you 
mr jer 
burroughs did long since represent your lordship 
unto the world 
under this characterepistle dedicatory before his treatise of a gracious spirit 
malice it self cannot but acknowledg 
that godliness in the strictness of it 
and natural excellencies in the eminency of them 
have a blessed conjunction in your honour 
and he applieth unto your lordship 
that high commendation 
which nazienzen gave of athanasius 
that he was magnes &amp 
adamas 
a load-stone in his sweet 
gentle 
and drawing nature 
and yet an adamant 
in his resolute 
stout carriage against those who were evil 
dr spurstow hath more lately dedicated his treatise of gods promises to your honour 
desiring that it may prove in your hands 
as the rod of myrtle in the hand of the traveller 
which as historians report 
doth keep him from growing weary
and now 
my lord 
i make bold to commend this book unto your perusall 
as a further help 
for your guidance and encouragement in the path of piety 
that none of the temptations of these shaking times 
whereby multitudes are drawn aside 
some to the right hand 
and others to the left 
may in the least prevail against you 
hitherto 
your steddiness in holding close to your old principles 
profession and engagements 
doth render you a christian established by grace 
in their account 
who see many others of all callings and conditions 
turned round about 
like giddy men 
in their opinions and conversations
your lordship hath seen and felt 
the assaults of sundry changes 
and yet neither the frowns 
nor the fawnings of men 
neither the showrs 
nor the sun-shine of the times 
have caused you to change your habit 
to put off your robe of righteousness 
which hath been your honour amongst men 
is your comfort 
in your most secret 
serious retirements 
and will be your crown of rejoycing in the day of christprincipium

godliness is profitable for all things 
in the beginning 
progress and conclusion of a christian course 
and 
though the world saith 
gain is godliness 
yet st paul turneth the proposition backward 
affirming 
that godliness is gain 
and there is much reall truth in this assertion 
however it be commonly and impudently contradicted in the world 
the apostle insinuateth a convincing argument 
to conclude the
great gain which cometh in by godliness 
viz 
because it produceth and continueth true contentment 
the original language hinteth 
that there is an all-sufficency in piety 
unto which solomons expression seemeth parallel 
a good man shall be satisfied from himself 
yea 
the heathen philosophers placed a kind of satisfaction in vertue
by godliness 
we are made possessors of gods all-sufficiency 
and by the rules of godliness 
we may know our selves to be happy in the enjoyment of him 
the apostle moveth contentment with such things as we have 
by this argument 
for 
he hath said 
i will never leave thee 
nor forsake theepsal

and gods servants have attained this gracious frme of heart 
by this consideration 
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places

for what kind of true good

so it is not possible

the dove which noah sent out of the ark

to the christian reader
reader
the reverend author of this book 
was pleased to commend all his manuscripts to my trust 
which being noised abroad 
i was moved by many 
to make more of his works publick 
and some of these treatises 
which are here conjoyned in one volume were particularly mentioned 
but i 
with the consent of some of his worthy friends 
gain-said these motions for many years 
upon these grounds
1 
because they were penned long since 
and therefore may be accounted to fall short of the ripened abilities which he afterwards attained
2 
because 
as some passages herein were borrowed from authors 
whom he hath not nominated 
so some short notes gathered out of these manuscripts 
when lent unto friends for private use 
have already in their printed tracts been committed to publique view
3 
and because my self 
through want of health and leasure 
could neither carefully peruse the work 
nor attend the press
while i was 
by these arguments concluded under this resolution 
some pieces of this book did fall 
through an unexpected providence 
into the hands of a worthy friend 
who upon the reading of them 
was earnest with me to make them publique 
being confident that thereby i might do an acceptable and profitable service unto many 
this importunity was the more prevalent 
coming from one whose eminency in learning and piety 
had deservedly gained high estimation in my heart and judgment 
and i have the rather yeelded unto this request 
not only because these papers might possibly after my death 
fall into some hands unto prejudice 
but also considering 
that 
through gods mercy 
such savoury discourses do
find good acceptance among many 
even in these erroneous 
broken times 
i know that there are many treatises upon the self-same profitable subjects here discoursed of 
which have been published 
both in former and later times 
by sundry eminent and faithfull servants of jesus christ 
yet i hope 
that in this case 
store will be no sore 
but that the same divine practical truths 
by meanes of many hands 
will be the more fully cleared 
strongly confirmed 
and prevailingly perswaded unto the readers profit 
every believing christian from a principle of spiritual self-love 
will make a godly life his chief business 
because no other course can possibly be so advantagious 
either here or hereafter 
and this is the great argument whereby st paul perswadeth the study1 tim

and practice of it 
exercise thy self unto godliness 
for bodily exercise profiteth little 
but godliness is profitable unto all things 
having the promise of the life that now is 
and of that which is to come 
some men toyl at home 
and take journeys abroad to gain worldly wealth 
others by running races 
by wrestlings 
feats of activity 
and by acts of magnanimity

and others by outward works of worship and devotion 
do procure to themselves much estimation 
but alas 
how inconsiderable is all this advantage 
being compared with the soul happiness to be enjoyed in the waies of godliness 
upon this account the apostle calleth for vigour and double industry 
in all the practices of piety 
as the original word which he useth doth import
king solomon 
the wisest and the wealthiest of the sonnes of men 
having together with all worldly contentments

and in the holy scriptures

but the godly ones 
are pronounced happy

because they are reall possessors of god himself 
as their portion 
who is infinitly better 
both in himself and unto them 
than all things besides 
upon what account soever men call those happy 
who have the world at will 
either in reference unto personal 
or relative satisfactions 
this may truly be added 
rather blessed is that people 
who have the lord for their god 
the master of the mint

cannot want money 
but there is much more truth in this conclusion of davids faithpsal

now who can relate the various precious obligations of gods love 
unto every godly soul 
god will be a sun and shield 
he will give grace and glory 
and no good thing will he withhold from them who walk uprightly 
seek ye first the kingdom of god 
and his righteousness 
and all other things shall be cast in unto you 
and as all things good shall be conferred 
so all things seemingly evil 
shall be converted to their good 
their best good 
their heavenly father correcteth for their profit 
that they may be partakers of his holiness 
when they are engulfed into troubles 
and overwhelmed with afflictions 
no evil doth touch them 
for 
god intendeth them no hurt 
but the worst of providences 
whether from men persecuting 
devils tempting 
or corruptions rebelling 
whether they imbitter 
or shorten life 
yet they shall according to gods purpose and promise effect infallibly 
their internal and eternal advantage 
the high rough windes do hasten the ship to shore 
winter weather 
frost 
snow 
and stormes 
do bring on the expected harvest
3 
and god all-sufficient 
with all the promises of his rich grace 
shall abide as a portion for his people to live upon for ever 
when turned out of the possession of all creature accommodations 
thus gods servants have experienced in their lowest condition upon earth 
when opposed and overpowered by men 
and this god himself is engaged by the word of his grace 
to make good unto the godly in all generations 
whereas 
riches are uncertain 
they have eagles wings to fly away 
either they will leave their owners 
or their owners leave them 
and this is most true 
in regard of all sublunary satisfactions 
they perish in the using 
like the sweet flowers 
which do wither by our smelling 
as they profit but little in degree 
so but for a short time in respect of duration 
but here i may justly take up a lamentation 
because the most amongst the children of men 
do by their practices oppose this position 
concerning the gain of godliness 
for whence else is it 
that men will sin for a piece of bread 
as esau sold his birth-right for a mess of pottage 
and had much rather be trading for worldly wealth 
than conversing with god in holy ordinances 
that they might advance in godliness 
yea 
multitudes 
who with their lips will applaude the waies of holiness 
yet by their lives give the ly to the language of their tongues 
in the judgment of all knowing ingenuous persons 
who do converse with them 
and therefore i heartily wish that those people would speak less and do more 
let your light so shine before men 
that they may see your good works 
and glorifie your father which is in heaven 
although a desire of being happy 
is the effect of natural self-love 
planted in the hearts of the children of adam 
yet alas 
alas 
how few either take or know the right way to obtain it 
therefore the good hand of divine providence is
thankfully to be acknowledged 
in the many precious helps vouchsafed 
both in former and later years 
for our guidance and encouragemet through the wilderness to the land of promise 
and i humbly hope that through gods blessing 
this piece 
being seriously perused 
will prove profitable 
as the subject matter of the book 
being the whole body of godliness in its properties and parts 
may strongly plead for its entertainment 
so the name of the worthy author will make way for its welcome amongst all such who knew him 
either by communion with his person 
or by acquaintance with such of his works as have heretofore been made publique 
much i could speak upon mine own personal knowledg 
concerning this my honoured friend 
whose life was eminently answerable to this his discourse of godliness 
but i will forbear 
for his works do praise him in the gate 
reader 
the several parts of this large treatise 
which are now collected into own volume 
were written in many books by the authors own hand 
and thou hast them by way of question and answer 
as he himself had framed them 
the first chapter only i have presumed to prefix 
because it was judged expedient that some such introduction should make way for the following discourse
i commend the whole to the blessing of god 
that spiritual edification being thereby received 
great glory may come to his majesty 
by the thanks givings of many through jesus christ

i 
discovering the nature 
and extent of true godliness 
together with arguments to perswade both the knowledg and practice thereof
question 
wherein doth true godliness consist
a 
true godliness doth consist in mans obediential conformity unto gods revealed will 
with respect unto his name
1 
man having received his being from god 
and having his constant universall dependence upon him 
this is a necessary inference 
according to the principles of nature 
and right reason 
that therefore he is bound to acknowledg divine soveraignty 
together with his own subjection 
by taking laws from his highness 
for the right ordering of his conversation 
and so farre as the children of men are carefull to frame their lives according to this rule 
they are in the scripture account 
judged godly 
as it is said of ananiasact 
2212 
that he was a godly or devoute man 
according to the law 
whereas 
those actions which with most specious pretences 
seem to express devotioncol 
820 
23 
act 
1723 
being the meer inventions and prescriptions of men 
are to be esteemed no better 
then will-worship 
and superstition
2 
and though the matter of obedience be according to gods express command
yet it is not to be reputed godliness 
except man therein hath reall reference unto god 
it is considerable 
that in the holy scripture 
both mens actions 
and dispositions 
are denominated godly upon this account 
thus the apostles st john commending gaius 
for his charity to the church-members addeth these words3 joh 
6 
whom if thou bring forward on their journey 
after a godly manner 
thou shalt do well 
and the great characteristical difference betwixt morality and piety

and the other relateth unto godgen

there was integrity in abimelech 
which fell short of that godly sincerity 
which administred comfort unto the holy apostles of christ 
and faelix his trembling was farre inferiour unto that godly fear 
unto which the heires of heaven are perswaded 
that godly sorrow 
that sorrow according to god 
for which the repenting corinthians are commended 
did much exceed ahabs mourning 
and the like difference is to be put betwixt the jealousie of a man 
such as is expressed by lamech 
and that godly jealousie which st paul found burning in his bosome towards the corinthians 
this therefore must be known 
that as the rule of a godly life 
is gods word 
so the object 
and the end unto which godliness relateth 
is god himself
q 
how farre doth true godliness extend 
and reach in a christian course
a 
it's manifest from that which was before suggested 
that godliness is of equall latitude with the holy scripture 
which doth direct man whole course of life in reference unto god 
it is true 
that sometimes the word godliness 
is strictly taken 
and restrained unto the duties of divine worship 
when it's mentioned as distinct from temperance2 pet 
16 
7 
brotherly kindness 
and charity 
in which sense also it is to be taken 
when the apostle exhorteth to live soberly

and godly in this present world 
and the original words whereby the holy ghost doth express it 
both in the old and new testament 
do favour this restrictive sense 
the hebrew word is indifferently translated godly 
or holy 
and the greek word 
applied to persons 
is rendred godly 
or devoute 
as when applied to actions 
it's translated worships 
or devotions 
but although this be acknowledged 
yet in the holy scripture godliness is more comprehensive 
and when the apostle perswading godliness 
saith 
that it is profitable unto all things 
some render the wordbeza 
true worship 
otherstrem 
righteousness 
somegrot 
vertue 
and mr calvin saith 
it comprizeth obedience to the commandements of both tables2 pet

luk 
16 
st peter also maketh godly and righteous equivalent 
and of equall extent 
and we know that the truly righteous man 
is carefull to walk in all the commandements and ordinances of the lord universally 
therefore let the comprehensiveness of godliness be considered briefly in these particulars
1 
it relateth unto all the holy truths on record in scripture 
which are to be known 
believed 
and converted into practice 
the discovery of christ in the gospel1 tim 
316 
1 tim 
63 
tit 
11 
is called the mystery of godliness 
and the whole systeme of divine revelations recorded in the bible 
is said to be 
the doctrine 
and the truth according to godliness 
godliness therefore doth as well respect opinions entertained 
as duties discharged
2 
the practice of godliness doth imply a cautious declining of all lusts whatsoevertit

condemned and decryed in holy writ 
denying ungodliness and wordly lusts 
we should 
saith the apostle 
live godly in this present world 
in which words the casheiring of all corruptions 
without indulging any 
is intended
3 
godliness containeth the conscientious performance of all positive duties 
whether they do concern god or man 
cornelius is called a godly 
or devate man 
because 
fearing god 
he gave much almes 
and prayed to god alwaies
and st paul perswading piety towards parents doth more then intimate that godliness doth comprehend the several services1 tim 
54 
required in our various humane relations
4 
lastly 
reall godliness doth comprehensively graspe 
the right manner of christian obedience 
with the whole matter thereof commanded in the word of truth 
the original word 
most ordinarily used to signifie godliness 
doth evidently point at serving god well 
whether in acts of immediate 
or mediate worship 
which the lord both requireth and acceptethisa 
117 
gen 
47 
tit 
212 
and this serving of god godly 
in regard of the manner 
doth comprize 1 
the root 
2 
the rule 
3 
and the end of mans obedience
1 
love to god is the root from whence godliness doth spring 
in which respect nehemiah his goodness in taking care of holy worshipneh 
1314 
is called his kindness 
the same word in the original 
we have else-where translated 
godly 
and the word is very significative chesidah being the name of the storkpsal 
326 
psal 
10417 
which bird is the emblem of love 
because the young ones 
when grown strong 
are wont to carry the old ones

2 
the rule or guide of godlinessact 
2212 
gal 
616 
is gods word 
as was touched upon before 
which is the constant canon of the true israelites conversation 
making way for his acceptance with the lord 
that goodness of josiah 
which god approved 
is thus discribed2 chro 
3526 
that it was according to that which was written in the law of the lord
3 
the glory of god is the end wherein true godliness doth determine 
this followeth undeniably from the two former particulars 
for whosoever acteth from a principle of good-will to god 
eyeing his word as the compass by which he steereth 
cannot but intentionally aim at 
and center in his praise2 tim 
312 
joh 
1228 
&amp 
171 
4 
as it was with jesus christ 
the fountain from which godliness doth arise 
who made his fathers glory the chief end both of his active and passive obedience
all these things being premised 
that treatise of godliness which fetcheth in the whole duty of man 
will not be censured as improper or impertinent
q 
by what arguments may the study of godliness 
in this comprehensive consideration 
both in the knowledg 
and practice thereof 
be perswaded
a 
first 
a principle of self-love may prevalently perswade this endeavour

many say

we will go to such a place and tarry there 
and get gain 
the best 
and most abiding gain 
cometh in by meanes of godliness 
for it hath the promise both of this life 
and of that which is to come
1 
in this life it's profitable to all things 
i shall point at some 
1 
by means hereof every talent is fruitfully traded 
every relation christianly filled 
every duty conscientiously discharged 
every ordinance profitably improved 
every comfort spiritually seasoned 
and every cross more easily carried 
2psal 
43 
psal 
326 
god hath marvellously separated to himself the man that is godly 
and therefore when he prayeth 
he may confidently look for audience godliness alone layeth the foundation of reall contentment in every state and change of life 
for in god1 tim 
66

the godly man hath sufficiency 
and may safely say with jacob 
i have all 
and enjoying god 
he may assure himself 
that all creature-wants shall be supplied 
and all occurences undoubtedly sanctified
2 
neither is the gain of godliness confined unto this present life 
for at the end of this life 
unto those who have given diligence to adde godliness unto other vertues2 pet 
1511 
shall entrance be ministred abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of jesus christ 
when death shall smmon to appear at christs tribunal 
others shall tremble to think of that dreadfull day 
they who have lived
godly 
shall with the expectations of faith 
look for that blessed hope 
and the glorious appearing of christtit 
212 
13 
2 pet 
311 
12 
and as a fruit of their holy conversation 
and godliness 
they shall with joy hacte unto the coming of the day of god—having these promises 
therefore 
unto which very many more might be added 
we all2 cor 71 
should alwaies be perfecting our holiness in gods fear
secondly 
the study of godliness may be quickned by this consideration 
if well improved 
viz 
that the lord himself doth propound it as the great end of the sweetest providences which do concern us
1 
whereas freedom from commotions and persecutions from men 
which do waste and imbitter our creature-comforts 
is a blessing of much worth 
we are advised to beg it with respect to godliness 
that we may live a quiet and peaceable life1 tim 
21 
2 
saith the apostle 
in all godliness and honesty
2 
and whereas outward peace in the world would be of small value without the light of the gospel 
it pleaseth the almighty to shine amongst us 
by the word of his grace 
that thereby we may be taught 
denying all ungodlinss and worldly luststit 
210 
11 
to live soberly 
righteously 
and godly in this present world
3 
lastly 
neither peace amongst men 
nor the plentifull and clear publication of the gospel 
can make us truly happy without christ 
therefore god exhibiteth 
and conferreth christ with the benefits of redemption by himluk 
174 
75 
that we may live godly 
righteously 
and soberly before him all the daies of our lives
if then there be any respect 
either to our own comfort 
or to gods content 
these arguments will be prevalent with us 
to use double industry 
in husbanding all holy helpes 
that we may not take up with a form and image of godliness 
but express the power of it in our whole conversation

q who is the author of this heavenly wisdome

q what are the offices or parts of wisdome
a 
the first office of wisdome is to know the laws according to which we must live 
which is called spirituall understandingcol 
19 
10 
rom 
12 
whereby we are inabled to know and conceive spiritually 
truth and falshood 
good and evill 
and this first office of prudence is the rule of all the restprov

the second office is to compare laws equall

and thereby to deliberate and advise according to spirituall understanding what is good or bad 
true or false 
expedient or inconvenient

heb

the third is to determine 
resolve 
and judge aright 
what is to be esteemed 
chosen and put in practice 
and herein stands the very nature and forme of of true christian prudence 
when a man 
upon true knowledge and due consideration of things and actions 
together with their properties 
and circumstances 
rightly esteeming 
discerning 
and weighing 
all and every thing that must come into consideration 
doth proceed to an holy

in a time free or otherwise
q 
let us hear some common rules of wisdome to be observed
a 
first 
in the first place 
and above all things 
a man must provide for the forgivenesse of his sinnes 
and the salvation of his soule 
sinners and unrepentant persons are sundry times in scripture termed foolsmat 
633 
as in many other respects 
so principally in this 
because they faile in this point of wisdome 
going on in their sinnes without repentance 
it is the part of a wise man to use no delaies in heavenly matters 
nor to deferre repentance from day to day 
for the daies are evill 
and man may be surprized in his sinnes before he be aware 
secondly 
we must diligently observe the danger wherein we are by reason of temptations 
and labour daily to search and finde out the secret counselsmar

practises 
and enterprises of our enemies 
that we may prevent them 
especially we must watch against our spirituall enemies 
the corruption of our hearts 
the temptations of the devill 
and the day and houre of our death 
that we be not found unprepared 
thirdly 
the fear of the lord 
throughout all our whole life 
must be our chiefe treasure 
and our care must be to grow in meeknesse as we increase in knowledge 
for the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdome 
fourthly 
every man must measure himself by his own strength 
and do nothing beyond his ability 
to this purpose is that of the apostle 
let no man thinke of himself more highly then he ought to thinkerom 
123 
2 cor 
101314 
but to thinke soberly 
according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith 
and as he exhorteth all men to be sober and modest 
and not to take more upon them then they have graces and calling of god to answer and to dischargeesa 
6 
so he applieth this generall exhortation particularly and most directly unto them who have publique callings to trade in the church 
as those by whose overweening the church might suffer greatest hurt 
wherefore his charge to them is 
that they teach not vauntingly nor ambitiously 
making a greater shew of knowledge then indeed they had 
but according to the proportion of faith 
that is to say 
of the gifts that they had received by faith 
fifthly 
things dishonest and of evill report must be let passe 
but things honest and of good report carefully practised 
whatsoever things are truehil 
48 
rom 
1217 
1 cor 
8 21 
whatsoever things are honest 
whatsoever things are just 
whatsoever things are pure 
whatsoever things pertaine to love 
whatsoever things are of good report 
if there be any vertue 
if there be any praise 
thinke on these things 
sixthly 
we may not be temporizers 
but we may and must give place to the sway of the times wherein we live 
so farre forth as may stand with faith 
a good conscience 
and the discharge of duty 
in our due perticular vocation 
this rule was practised by paul 
who living among the heathens 
was constrained to speak as they did 
and therefore he stickes not to say 
that he departed in a ship to rome 
whose badge was castor and polluxact 
2811 
act 
1910 
again 
he was three years in ephesus 
an idolatrous place 
where the great goddesse diana was worshipped 
yet in all that time he had so contained himselfeact 
1926 
that demetrius could not charge him to have spoken directly against that idoll 
onely he had preached 
that they were no gods 
which were made with hands 
and as paul 
so the rest of the apostles no doubt 
did become all things to all men 
that they might winne some 
seventhly 
prudence will not advise 
intend or do any thing 
either by way of simulation 
or dissimulation 
that is contrary to the glory of god 
or tends any way to the prejudice of the least truth 
to the scandall of our weake brethren 
or neglect of duty in our particular vocation 
abraham lied not in saying that sarah was his sister 
nor did he simply offend against the truth 
against piety towards god 
or common charity towards men 
but against the love which he owed to his wife by particular callinggen 
20 
whereby he was
bound to protect her against wrongs 
and not expose her to danger as by that saying he did

and withholds him from medling with that which no waies pertains unto him 
yet so as he will not communicate in the sinnes of other men 
a wise man will not challenge that authority to himselfe alone which be longs to many 
nor presume to do that by his sole power 
which pertains to many in joynt commission 
nor will he suffer himselfe to be so over-ruled by them 
as to partake in their sinnes lay hands suddainly on no man 
neither be partaker of other mens sinnes 
keepe thy selfe pure 
ninthly 
in necessary duties prudence directeth to do what god requireth 
and then leave the successe to him 
that can do more then we are able to comprehend 
and will effect his own pleasure by unlikely meanes in the judgement of men 
tenthly

eleventhly 
if we cannot effect the good things we desire 
in that exquisite and holy manner that we would 
we must not tumultuously contend 
or make unlawfull separations 
but commending the cause to god 
and waiting further opportunity to do good 
we must content our selves with the meane 
and take the lesse 
when the greater cannot be obtained 
for example 
in many churches sundry abuses are not reformed 
superstitious customes do still continue 
images do stand undefaced 
the good desire of the godly is 
that they may be removed 
amended 
pulled down 
but this cannot be brought to passe 
what then must they do in this case 
they must not raise tumults 
nor seperate themselves from the congregations where the substance of doctrine is soundly taught 
and the ordinances of god are truely administred 
but they must seeke unto god for helpe 
keepe themselves innocent without offence 
and by humble supplication intreate the lawfull magistrate for redresse of what is out of order 
and in the meane time rest content with that they have done

q 
what rules of wisdome are to be observed touching the collation of laws 
and of which regard especially is to be had 
comparison being made
a 
first 
what laws do simply respect god 
in comparison they are alwaies to be preferred before other laws commanding just things 
much more the law of man 
must give place to the law of god 
and the love of our neighbour to the love of god 
love of christ over-ruleth the love of parents 
of wife 
children 
friends 
brethren 
yeapsal

so farre must the one yeeld unto the other 
that for the love of christ 
the love of parents must be turned into hate 
for their is nothing of such weight 
that man can with any pretence of equity set before the lord almighty 
to whom nothing in the world is to be compared 
much lesse preferred 
not our father 
for he is our chief father 
and not ours onely 
but the maker of our parents 
not our life 
for god is he 
who if we die for his name sake 
can adorne us with life eternall 
but if we preferre our life before him 
he can afflict us with torment of eternall death 
if any friend therefore should aske me to tell a lie for his sake 
i must answer him 
it behooveth me to helpe
my friend 
but in the lord 
if the magistrates should threaten banishment 
or other extremity to my parents almost spent with age 
unlesse i will depart from the known confession of faith 
i must rather leave my parents to the lust and rage of the magistrate 
then deny the faith 
it is just to succour parents 
but not with breach of piety 
secondly 
betwixt evils of sin there is no election 
but all 
even the least 
are to be avoided 
of two sinnes 
we must choose neither 
but submit our selves to the greatest extremity 
even death it selfe 
rather then be compelled to that which is evill or dishonest 
all sinnes are equally to be shunnedjob 
137 
8 
9 
we must not tell a lie for the glory of god 
much lesse to save our life 
their condemnation is just 
who teach that men may do evill 
that good may come of it 
if in time of trouble an offer were maderom 
38 
that if we would save our selves 
we should breake the laws of piety or honesty 
as that we should deny god 
or murther our brother 
neither is to be chosen 
but we must commit our selves into the hands of god in wel-doing 
thirdly 
in free time superiour laws are alwaies preferred to inferiour 
things more common to the lesse common 
publique to private 
and amongst the private they that are linked unto us by most bonds 
thus we must give more to citizens 
then to strangers 
to our kinred 
then to citizensrom 
164 
gal 
514 
to our parents 
then to our kinred 
to the magistrate church and countrey 
then to parents 
for we are bound to strangers onely by the law of humanity 
to our kinred by the law of humanity and affinity 
to the magistrate by a triple band of humanity 
affinity and peculiar covenant 
by this rule of wisdome 
the speciall calling must give place to the trade of christianity
1 king 
1715q 
the widow of sarepta relieved the prophet 
before she made provision for her self or her sonne
a 
unlesse the widow had certainly known it to be the speciall will of god 
she should not have done this 
namely to defraud her selfe and her sonne 
to the intent she might sustaine a man being a stranger 
neither ought prophets 
or men of god 
by the accustomed rule of piety 
to require this of any man 
that they should maintaine them without taking care for themselves and their children 
for even the apostle to timothy did plainly pronounce 
that1 tim 
58 
they which have not care of their own 
and especially of their family 
have denied the faith 
and are become worse then infidels 
and therefore he would that widows should be maintained by them of their own kinred 
but when the widow was now certified by the speciall will of god 
it was not for her to have respect what was commanded by the law in generall 
neither might that take place 
which is made a common proverb 
charity first beginneth at a man himself 
howbeit 
as touching the common course 
that we may perfectly discerne 
to whom we be more or lesse bound 
and not be deceived 
we must consider 
that there be divers kinds of societies 
kinreds and friendships 
one is spirituall 
another is bodily 
or of the same stock 
another is civill 
and such like 
wherefore 
when we reason concerning love 
and doing good unto our neghbours 
there ought a comparison to be made of those things 
which belong unto our degree 
which being not made 
an error will soon happen 
as for example 
if a man shall be instructed by a godly pastor and teacher of the word of god 
and shall be brought to sanctification 
and the same man have therewithall a father 
of whom he was begotten 
or have children 
and the question be asked 
whether he be more bound to his pastor 
or else to his father and children 
we must not answer absolutely 
seeing with our answer 
the matter would not be expressed 
but we may say 
that in those things 
which concerne spirituall friendship 
we ought more to obey the minister of the word 
that teacheth us rightly 
and admonisheth us out of the holy scriptures 
then either the children or the father 
if they
perswade things that be contrary and repugnant 
but if we demand as touching things of another sort 
namely 
of food 
and of maintenance 
there is more due unto parents 
and unto children 
then unto others 
though they be ministers of the word of god 
indeed the ministers of the word must be maintained 
but yet not so 
as any man should defraud either himself 
or his family of necessary living 
by another similitude the matter may be cleared 
admit that a man be in the campe 
where just warre is taken in hand 
when the general captain chargeth him in something concerning the affairs of warre 
and the father being present commandeth him to the contrary 
in this case the sonne shall rather offer himselfe to the general 
then to his father 
but if we shall determine of houshold businesse 
and of things pertaining to living and sustenance 
the parent shall be heard 
and not the general captaine
q 
is a man to preferre a stranger eminent in piety and vertue before his brother 
not so much adorned with the tokens of vertue 
or no
a 
wisdome commandeth thee to discerne offices due to nature 
from duties consecrated to piety and vertue 
and counselleth to give what are of nature 
to thy brother 
what pertaines to vertue 
to thy friend beautified with it 
thou must rather nourish and relieve thy poor brother then thy friend 
for this office is coupled with nature and blood 
according to which thou art more obliged 
and nearer to thy brother then to thy friend 
on the contrary 
thou must advance thy friend to publique honours or offices in church or common-wealth 
rather then thy brother 
and by this means 
thou shalt give to piety what is proper unto it 
to nature what belongs unto it
q if i see many strangers to be in danger 
and one good man that i know 
whether shall i helpe many strangers 
or that one i know
a 
a good man is to be preferred before a man of no worth 
but many strangers before one known person 
for the more common good is the better
q 
what if liberty of chusing the chief good be granted to any man 
should he chuse it for himself 
or for his countrey
a 
for himself 
because every man ought first and principally to love himself 
the former rule 
that things more common are to be preferred 
doth hold onely in those actions by which we perfect our selves 
and are in the way to the chiefest good 
a good man must be willing to lay down his life for the good of the church or common-wealth 
not that he doth preferre the good of his countrey before his own happinesse 
but that this is the way 
by which he may attain true blessednesse
q 
let us now proceed to some other rules of wisdome
a 
the fourth rule is 
that things of profit and pleasure 
must give place to things that belong to vertue and honesty 
the light of nature teacheth 
that in election things simply honest must never be set after laws of profit 
though the greatest and most common 
godlinesse is the great gaine 
therefore all gaine must give place to godlinesse 
the heathen man saith1 tim 
66 
gaine gotten by losse or hazard of a mans good name 
is no gaine but losseprov 
221 
which is much truer of gaine gotten with the breach or hazard of a good conscience 
but on the other side 
when profit in a mans purse would procure a breach in his conscience 
and the gaine of gold prove the break-neck of his soul 
such refusall of gaine 
is the greatest gaine that can be 
for saith an ancient father well 
to let go 
though never so great a matter 
for the compassing of a greater 
is no losing bargaine 
but a gainefull negotiation 
worldly men say 
who will shew us any good 
but davids prayer ispsal 
46 
lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us 
peradventure some small unseemlinesse
may be undergone to obtaine some great and common profit 
but no dishonesty is to be committed in hope of gaine 
for we must not do evill 
that good may come thereof 
neither doth it excuse 
that they say it is done for a good end 
for actions are not onely distinguished by their endsscalig 
exercit 
307 
26 
but by their efficient causes and formes
q 
did not lot well to offer his daughters to the lusts of the sodomites 
to prevent a greater mischief intended against his guestsgen 
19
a 
in so doing he sinned against his daughters 
whose chastity and credit he was bound to defend 
it is the duty of a father to defend the honesty of his daughters 
though with the danger of his life 
much lesse not to yeeld and offer them to wicked men to be defiled 
again 
he sinned against his own soule 
in the offering his daughters to be defiled 
he consented to their wickednesse 
and made himself 
if not the author 
yet an accessary to their sinne 
as for his respect unto the greatnesse and grievousnesse of the crime 
it excuseth not 
for the recompensing of one sinne with another 
is not to be suffered 
it was not lawfull for him 
to yeeld his daughters to the lewd lusts of the sodomites 
thereby to keepe them from a more grievous sinne 
neither is it lawfull 
that we in our selves should commit a lesse fault 
to avoid the greater 
wherefore when the matter cometh to sinne 
although it seeme to be but light 
it is wholly to be forborne 
and if any matter more hainous might seeme to ensue by the delay of sin 
the care thereof must be committed to god 
but under that pretence we must not commit any sinne 
whatsoever is sinne 
the same must straight-way be rejected 
let there afterwards follow what will 
what sin almost might not be excused 
if it were lawfull to redeeme a greater sin with a lesser
rom

2 not with sinne 
but with his losse and hurt 
namely 
to be accursed from christ 
not that he meant to be an apostate 
or to forsake his belief in christ 
but onely to be without the fruition of eternall and happy life 
he doth not wish to be made the enemy of christ 
but not to enjoy the blessed vision of christ 
that his brethren might be saved 
he doth not wish of an elect to be made a reprobate 
but remaining a chosen vessell to be deprived of the glory of the elect 
that the israelites might be saved 
if the will and counsell of god would suffer it 
to which he wholly submitteth himself
q 
what is a fit rule to be observed
a 
when two precepts of god seeme one to be repugnant to another 
so as the one is a hinderance to the other 
that they cannot both at one time be observed 
yea rather 
it is necessary that one of them for the time being be omitted 
then that which shall be judged weightiest and greatest 
must be retained 
but yet in the meane time 
that other 
which is reckoned to be lesse and lightereph 
411 
is not violated 
because in the same there is nothing done against the law of god1 tim 
3 6 
there is a law 
that the church must not be deprived of ministers 
so as it should be destitute of them 
and paul hath another law 
that a minister must not be a novice 
or man newly entered into religion 
the church of millan was much troubled 
because it could not finde a meet bishop 
that as well was free from the heresie of arius 
as also that had great authority and learning given him of god 
onely there was ambrose 
but yet a novice 
and newly come to the faith 
here are two laws met 
in shew contrary one to another 
but it was meet for the lesser law to give place to the greater 
for christ so taught 
when by the sentence
of the prophet he saith 
i will have mercy 
and not sacrifice 
howbeit he meaneth not 
that he will not have sacrificema 
9 13 
hose 
66 mat 
127 
but that if two commandements meet together 
whereof the one belongeth unto mercy 
and the other unto sacrifice 
he testifieth that he had rather have mercy 
then sacrifice 
in this rule sundry particulars come to be noted 
first 
the circumstantiall and ceremoniall duties of the first table 
must give place to the necessary and morall duties of the second table 
thus the strict rest of the sabboth 
may be broken without sinnejoh

when the performance of any work of instant necessity or mercy doth require our labour 
secondly 
the circumstances of the first table 
must give place to necessary ceremoniall duties 
the priests in the temple prophane the sabboth 
not simply and properly 
but in the opinion of the adversaries doing that which had not been lawfull 
if the worship of god did not excuse 
and are blamlesse 
thirdly 
the substantials of the second table of greater reason 
do over-rule the substantials of the second table of lesser reason 
thus moses permitted the jews to put away their wives for every causemat 
193 
deut 
241 
as namely 
for some filthinesse espied in them 
to prevent many grievous inconveniencies in the whole policy of the jews 
arising from the obstinacy and cruelty of that obdurate people 
but though the civill magistrate may tolerate some evils in the common-wealth to prevent the utter ruine and desolation of it 
yet we must not think it lawfull to redeeme a greater sinne with a lesser 
wilfully to cast away the good creatures of god 
which may serve for the use of manjob

but in a case of necessity to preserve life and prevent violence 
paul and the rest of his company which were in the ship with himact 
2719 
28 
did lawfully cast out their provision into the sea 
fourthly 
the more substantiall and necessary duties of the first table do over-rule the lesse necessary of the same 
in the time of hezekias 
the priests admitted the people to the passover2 chro 
3019 
who had not prepared themselves according to the preparation of the sanctuary 
the sixth rule 
in a time not free 
when we are pressed with some more grievous evill 
we may preferre inferiour laws to the superiour 
where regard is not had of the excellency of the law 
but of our need 
but things superiour are not promiscously to be set after things inferiour in the case of necessity 
but this election hath place in the collation of good things especially profitable 
in the comparison of things comely 
with profitable 
and in propositions lesse necessary 
whose opposites do not bring in the destruction of nature 
but some unseemliness 
and that such as doth admit excuse in regard of circumstances 
in the time of famine the servants of god have been compelled to leave the places of their habitation 
where god hath been worshipped 
and to sojourne in strange countries 
where the name of god hath not been known 
the seventh rule 
we must do the most necessary works of our callings that belong unto us 
though we leave other for the time undone 
when peter was inquisitivejoh 
2121 
what john should do 
christ gives him this answer 
what is that to thee 
follow thou me 
in which words he teacheth 
that not onely peter 
but also every man must attend upon the necessary and proper works of his own vocation 
and not deale with things whereunto he is not called 
the eighth rule 
of evils of punishment 
as troubles 
losses 
and such like 
the lesser is to be chosen 
as the merchant in danger upon the sea 
may cast away his wares to save his life 
the traveller may deliver his purse unto thieves 
to prevent further mischief 
when the prophet propounded three plagues to david 
of which he was to choose one2 sam 
2412 
13 
he chose to fall into the hands of god 
the reason is 
because in things of this nature 
the lesser evill hath a respect of good 
the ninth rule 
when choice of evils or punishments is offered to one that is innocent 
or questioned for the profession of true religion 
he is to choose neither 
but to expect and patiently endure whatsoever his enemies shall decree 
for by choice of punishment he consenteth to his own unjust vexation 
and is accessary to his own persecution
also by the free election of evill 
he brings himself into suspicion of sinne or blame 
and exposeth his credit and reputation of the calumnies of his adversaries 
who will be ready to object 
that he would never freely have chosen punishment 
if he had not been guilty of some fault 
an example of such spirituall wisdome we have in the french history in prince conde 
when charles the ninth king of france 
in the year 1572 
sent for prince conde 
and propounded three conditions to him 
of which he choose one 
the masse 
death 
or perpetuall imprisonment 
conde answered 
that by the grace of god 
he would neither choose the first 
and the other two he left to the pleasure of the king 
being assuered that god would governe the whole matter by his providence 
the tenth rule 
when tyrants and persecutours of the church 
give space to deliberate 
whether thou wilt obey their idolatrous decrees 
or be cast into prison 
deprived of thy goods 
thrust into banishment 
or miserably massacred 
thou must not deliberate 
nor accept of the space offered to deliberate 
but simple idolatry 
and obedience to that wicked decree 
is to be refuseddan

and not onely so 
but it argues that the minds of men are not fixed upon the truth 
nor affected towards the glory of god 
as is meet 
what 
that they which are over carefull 
least their life 
goods 
dignities should perish 
which is the ground of that deliberation 
do easily defile themselves with impure superstitions 
the eleventh rule 
christian wisdome will not permit men to promise silence in any necessary point of gods truth 
which they are called to testifie and make known 
that they might procure their own liberty 
and free themselves from vexation 
for such promise of silence is a kinde of halting 
doth argue timorousnesse 
and hinders the edification of others 
the ministers of the gospel must faithfully publish the whole truth of god 
and keep nothing back from the people 
which they have received of god 
but that they do not 
who promise silence in any necessary truth 
to purchase peace 
moreover 
this keeping silence doth hearten the adversaries in their courses 
and tends greatly to the prejudice of the truth 
which by this meanes is suppressed by little and little 
what is this 
but to forsake their brethren in the time of danger and difficulty 
in a sort to deny the truth 
set open a gappe for superstition to enter 
give opportunity and advantage to the adversary 
and cast an imputation upon them that are most forward 
as if they were humorous 
indiscreet 
furious 
when god calleth men forth to beare witnesse of the truth 
what is it but a kinde of starting back 
to binde our selves by promise not to publish that part of gods will 
which is now opposed and called into question 
then especially are we to abide in our station 
and to quit our selves like men 
when the truth is opposed by many adversaries 
moses being sent to deliver israel out of aegypt 
would not leave one hoofe behinde him 
daniel would not forbare to pray thrice a day 
nor to set open his window 
and look towards jerusalem 
that he might redeeme longer time 
wherein he might profit the church 
wisdome will neither run hastily 
nor deale unfaithfully 
the twelfth rule is 
in a case of necessity imposed by god himself 
it is lawfull to transgresse a circumstantiall or ceremoniall precept 
for the performance of a morall duty 
for then according to the minde and will
of the law-giver 
the lesser commandement must give place to the greater 
and in that case no precept is broken 
but if men upon their own will and pleasure shall impose ordinances upon the church 
contrary to the rules of scripture 
it is not lawfull to break the lesser commandement of the law 
that we might obtaine liberty to do the more excellentwhen the br ach of a ceremony 
carrieth with it the trangression of some moall duty 
in that case a man ought rather to die 
ten to be forced to that transgression 
where there is no necessity 
so for a christian 
to eare things sacrifised to idols for his ncessity 
when it may be done without offence 
is lawfull 
but to eare it in approbation of an idoll 
being thereunto compelled by the enemy

it had been none offence 
but when he is forbidden to pray upon paine of death 
he will not obey 
it is lawfull to fight against our enemies 
in defence of life and countrey 
upon the sabboth day 
if we be assaulted 
but a minister of the gospel might not go to the fencing-school an houre or two upon the lords day 
being thereunto commanded 
that he might procure liberty afterwards to preach the gospel 
in extremity it was lawfull for david to eate the shew-bread 
when he was an hungred 
but the jewes 
when there was no such necessity 
did choose rather to die 
then to eate swines flesh 
and thus when a man is called forth to beare witnesse to this or that point of gods truth 
it is not lawfull for him 
either by silence or denial of it 
to procure liberty to teach matters of greater importance in themselves 
when god thrusteth us upon greater duties 
the relinquishing of obedience to a lesser duty leaveth to be a sin 
because the law-giver in that case hath released us from the inferiour law 
but when god calleth to the practice of inferiour duties 
then to slip aside under pretence of doing greater and better service in the weightiest matters 
what is it but to do evill that good may come thereof 
necessity 
we say 
hath no law 
but is to be understood in mans laws 
when some suddain case falleth out 
so as the inferiour cannot have recourse to the law-maker 
that then he may interpret the law himself 
and break the letter of it 
to follow the reason and intent of it 
as in case of the murther of a thief 
but in the law of god 
one onely case doth dispence with it 
and that is 
when necessity from god so altereth a fact 
as it taketh away from it all reason of sinning 
as for example 
it is not lawfull to marry ones sister 
but in the beginning of the world extreme necessity altered this fact 
and gave dispensation 
so it is not lawfull to take away that which is anothers 
but 
as some divines think 
extreme necessity makes it lawfull 
because it is not anothers any longer 
seeing the law of nature it self maketh some things common in such extreme necessity 
on the sabboth we must hold our selves strictly to gods worship 
but if an house be on fire 
we may leave it without sin 
but that the pleasure of the church 
should so alter the nature of the fact 
as to make that lawfull which is contrary to the law of god 
is a paradox in divinity 
say the ministers of the gospel should be enjoyned to weare womens apparell 
under the penalty of deprivation 
might they redeeme their liberty by such conformity 
if not 
then the meer pleasure of men 
cannot make that lawfull 
which in some extreme necessity is not to be condemned 
and yet 
if men were disposed to plead for that practice 
they might say 
when two works or duties commanded of god 
do meet in one practice 
so as we cannot do them both 
but one of them must of necessity be done 
the other of necessity must be left undone 
in this case the work or duty of greater reason 
must be performed 
and that of lesser reason must be neglected and omitted 
and it is a sin to neglect the greater to performe the lesser 
but to preach the gospel is a work of greater reason 
then to suffer deprivation for refusing to weare womens apparell 
therefore it is necessary the ministers of the gospel should yeeld to weare womens apparell
in the case of deprivation 
if the conclusion be absurd 
one of the premises must needs be false at leastdatur quidem venia necessitati

or the whole frame inconsequent 
for of a truth nothing but truth doth follow 
in spirituall things to preach the word is so necessary 
as paul cries woe upon himself if he does not 
because the flock of god depends upon him 
but if i may not preach 
unlesse i wound my consicence 
by compounding with hereticks 
and blending truth with error 
i must never preach 
but leave the care of the church to god 
who without my lie 
will provide for the good of it 
thus elijah fled and left his ministry 
because he could not exercise it 
unlesse he would have received baals ceremonies 
and flattered with the baalites 
and if he had not thus forsaken his place 
he had forsaken the church 
great athanasius choosed rather to leave his church 
then to yeeld any thing to the arians 
st paul knew 
that after he went from ephesus 
grievous wolves would come in not sparing the flock 
and yet because he could not stay to preach 
unlesse he would have restored some pharisaicall observations 
and unlesse for peace sake he would have yeelded to the rites and image of diana 
he left the place 
because he must not do the greatest good by any evill meanes

say the apostles 
to whom 
to us apostles 
elders and brethren 
even the whole church at jerusalem 
what 
were all these immediatly inspired 
it would be hard to bring a brobable argument of that assertion 
i make no doubt 
but the apostles were certainly assured what to resolve in the matter proposed 
being specially assisted by the spirit of truth 
but out of the history it cannot be collected 
that they did waite for a new immediate revelation 
and relied not on the knowledge they had of the scriptures and truth of god 
the holy ghost speakes in the scripture 
as well as by immediate inspration 
whatsoever is soundly 
truly 
directly gathered thence 
and contained therein 
that is of god 
no lesse then that which is 
from him by immediate revelation 
therefore the apostles in saying 
it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us 
do declare that they subscribed to the holy ghost speaking in the scriptures 
and approved what there he taught 
but intend not to intimate an extraordinary inspiration to make that decree 
for as the scriptures are said to foresee in respect of the author of them 
so it may be said in respect of the scriptures 
that it pleaseth the holy ghost 
and it is apparent by the councel 
that those decrees pleased them 
because they concluded them out of the scriptures 
and this is evidently set down by the greek scholiast 
which saith 
that therefore the holy ghost is there set down 
for that christ had not taught this 
but the councell uttered themoecum 
in hunc loc 
grounded of the law 
2 
the things imposed were necessary before they were injoyned 
not necessary because injoyned 
necessary 
not simply in themselves 
but by accident in respect of that time for the preventing of offence 
the weaknesse of the jews 
and collation of the gentiles with them 
was the reason why the apostles commanded abstinence from bloodlyra in act 
15 and strangled 
among the gentiles 
and that reason ceasing 
the the observation it self ceased 
for the authority of moses 
and the common and ancient custome long in use 
abstinence from these things ought not rashly 
could not suddainly be laid aside without scandall 
and for that cause 
the apostles tendering the weaknesse of the jewes 
commanded the gentiles to abstaine from these things 
respecting the offence 
not the things themselves 
it was indeed imposed without expresse limitation of time 
but not without respect
to scandall 
which was the maine cause of that constitution

and minde of the councell 
doth so explaine it 
that he teacheth it is not unlawfull to eate of any meate that is sold in the shambles 
unlesse it be in case of offence 
yea 
that every creature of god is good 
and ought not to be refused 
if it be sanctified with the word and prayer 
and the very scope and drift of the apostles in that decree was 
to deliver the gentiles from the yoake of the ceremoniall law 
therefore they command not abstinence from things strangled 
and blood 
as from things uncleane 
that had been contrary to their intent and purpose to establish the ceremonials 
but for the peace and quietnesse of the church 
that the conscience of the weake jews might not be offended 
in time of the law 
when the use of these things was prohibited to the jews 
it was lawfull for the gentiles to eate thereof 
much more in time of liberty they were not forbidden 
as things in themselves 
or by institution simply unlawfull 
the giving of offence 
not the eating of blood 
or strangled 
further then it was offensive 
is that which is forbidden 
the one as the end 
the other as the means during the time it did continue to be scandalous 
and when the offensive eating onely 
and not the simple use of blood and strangled is prohibited 
of what necessity could it be to adde any limitation of time to that constitution 
neither can any object 
that it is urged as perpetuall 
upon an ordinary and standing reason of necessity 
and fitnesse 
for abstinence from these things is not urged at all as fit or necessary in it self 
but with consideration of those times and occasions 
so that the gentiles might lawfully without breach of law or scruple of conscience 
eate of either 
in so doing 
they did not scandalize

they were suffered to dwell as strangers amongst the israelites

so that it was easie and not burdensome for the gentiles to observe these things in common with the jews

the apostles observed the jewish ceremonies 
and advised one another so to do 
paul circumcised timothy 
shaved his head 
purified himself 
made a vow 
contributed 
offered sacrifice for his purification 
observed the jewish sabboth

and the elders of jerusalem
a 
what the apostles did 
they did voluntarily 
because they judged it most expedient so to do 
no necessity of command 
but expediency of fact at that time and place inducing them thereunto 
if the argument that some divines would draw from this their practice 
be of any force 
we may conclude 
that a minister of the gospel 
living amongst popish and superstitious people 
who do hold and esteeme the observation of most or all popish rites 
customes and ceremonies 
to be essentiall parts of gods worship 
and necessary to salvation 
he 
to please the people 
and to winne the more liberty to preach the gospel is bound to conforme unto them all 
yea 
though their use be not enjoyned 
but prohibited by law 
for the apostles had in the councel defined 
that the gentiles should not be burdened with jewish observances 
but onely abstaine from blood 
and strangled 
neverthelesse 
paul after this circumcised timothy 
purified himself 
and not because he was thereunto compelled by the law of any superiour
or stood in danger of deprivation in case he did refuse 
but that he might not offend the weak believers 
that he might winne the unbelievers to the gospel 
now draw this into forme of reasoning 
and it runneth thus 
the practice of the apostles in submitting to jewish ceremonies 
is a patterne and samplar for us 
what we may and must do in receiving or refusing significant 
scandalous 
inconvenient ceremonies devised by men 
imposed by authority 
abused to superstition or idolatry 
for in what cases they admitted of jewish ceremonies 
in the same or like 
it is lawfull 
yea necessary for us to receive and tolerate by practice 
ceremonies of like nature devised by men 
but the apostles 
when they were conversant amongst the jews 
did submit to the use of jewish ceremonies inconvenient 
urged by contentious brethren 
with an opinion of holinesse 
necessity 
and worship 
perniciously abused for confirmation of most false 
hereticall and impious doctrines 
for use and continuance 
the occasions of many pernicious effects to them that abused them 
and this they did twenty years after they had preached the doctrine of liberty 
not by compulsion of law 
but voluntarily to please the people 
and winne liberty to the gospel 
therefore the ministers of the gospel should voluntarily and of their own accord 
yeeld to the practice of any or the mos part of popish or jewish ceremonies 
if they be urged by superstitious and contentious brethren as essentiall parts of worship 
necessary to salvation 
though the use and continuance of them be the occasions of many pernicious effects to them that abuse them

from this example of the apostles going up to the temple at the time of prayer 
and their conformity to other legall rites 
some would gather 
that it is lawfull for christians to present themselves bodily at the masse 
so in heart they detest the abomination there committed 
a collection much like the former

that the ceremonies of the law commanded by god 
were necessary till christ 
and being abrogated by his death 
they ceased not to be of use amongst the jews 
till the destruction of jerusalem 
for god would not have his temple stand without some ceremonies 
which as long as it stood was an holy mansion of heavenly doctrine 
and a place where he might lawfully be worshipped 
the apostles did not so teach the abrogation 
no not of those things which were necessarily to cease 
but that even the jews being christians 
might for a time continue in them 
it pleased god to deliver the law of ceremonies unto the jews 
to confirme it by visible signes and wonders 
to appoint a place 
even a tabernacle 
where they should meet to practice that ceremoniall worship 
and to tie the exercise of it to that place onely 
the same god appointing a second place to be built by solomon 
did fill it with his glory 
and gave commandement to all the tribes to resort thither 
to performe the eternall service of the law 
and within the gates of jerusalem to eate the passover 
and when the city and temple was destroyed 
the exercise of the legal worship of sacrifices 
was suspended and stayed till their returne out of babylon 
then god purposing to re-establish his ordinances 
stirred up the spirit of the persian kings 
to further the building of the temple 
incited the people to that work by haggie and zachary 
and after the finishing of it 
promised his presence therein 
renewed again his covenant with them 
and bound them to worship him with legal service in that place 
now as god did thus visibly and apparantly 
dealing with the jews as children 
confirme the law of the carnall commandement 
so it was expedient 
considering his wonted manner of dispensation with the jewish people 
that by some visible signes he should manifest unto them the utter abolition of the law and rites thereof 
which was not done so fully whiles the temple stood 
for the standing of the temple
did imply a continuance of the leviticall rites 
for the exercise whereof the temple was dedicated and set apart 
the prophet daniel did fore-tell when the sacrifices and ceremonious worship was utterly to be abolished 
in these words 
and he shall confirme the covenant with manydan

and in the middest of the weak

still remained in the holy city and temple of god 
and that by speciall dispensation 
when the temple was made equall to the ground 
the ceremonies were honourably buried under the ruines of it 
and afterwards they ceased to be indifferent 
but till that time their use was not wholly determined 
as that which was presently to be abandoned 
and no longer to be continued amongst believers 
christ jesus by his death did fulfill the bloody and foreshewing tipes of his death 
and so the substance coming in place 
the shadow vanished of its own accord 
neverthelesse 
seeing the jews had solemnly received the ceremoniall law from god 
it had by many evident and visible signes and tokens been confirmed to be divine and from above 
it was necessary 
they should as plainly and plentifully be assured from heaven 
that now according to the good pleasure of god 
it was to cease 
for none but god himself can dispense with his law 
authority inferiour cannot set us free 
when superiour power hath laid his bond upon us 
the jews knew for certaine 
that they had been obliged in conscience to the observation of the law of rites and ceremonies 
and in all quity the doctrine of liberty and freedom 
must fully and manifestly be published and made known unto them 
before they could be urged to relinquish and forego the use of it 
which after so solemne manner was pressed upon them 
yea 
so graciously was the lord pleased to deale with them 
that till the efficacy of christs death was plentifully manifested 
and the abrogation of those ceremonies by visible signes and tokens undoubtedly ratified 
he dispensed with the weak believing jews in those observations 
the legal figures were given to the jews till christ should shine in their hearts 
which was done by little and little 
and the infirmity of the believing jews was excusable 
till they were plentifully enlightned with the beames of truth 
and infallibly certained of the ceasing of those ordinances 
to which for a long season they had been obliged and acustomed 
but the matter it self speakes 
that christ for a long time was unknown to many of them 
other were so illustrated with his beames 
that they wanted much of full shining brightnesse 
the most were ignorant of their freedome and deliverance from the bondage and burden of the leviticall law 
peter himself 
who had familiarity 
conversed with our saviour more or lesse 
from whose mouth he daily heard most heavenly directions 
and saw the wonders that he did 
who by many signes and tokens had been infallibly confirmed of the assurance of christs resurrection
and with the rest of the apostles was furnished with the extraordinary gifts of the holy ghost 
to preach the gospel of the kingdome to all nations 
he 
two years or thereabouts after the ascension of our saviour 
was so ignorant of this truth 
as were other of the apostles also 
that he needed information therein by vision from heaven can any man imagine 
that the through information of the jews in this point 
is a work of small time and labour 
full instruction and a good space of time was needfull to acquaint them with 
and to root them in the doctrine of christian liberty 
and this time granted 
was from the death of christ 
till the destruction of jerusalem 
our blessed saviour jesus christ 
the wisdome of the father 
speaking of the time of sacking and eversion of jerusalem 
did expresly command his hearers and disciples the jews to praymat 
2420 
that their flight might not be upon the sabboth day 
to wit 
that day which the jews observed for their sabboth 
which admonition is proof more then probable 
that the observation of jewish ceremonies 
was tolerated amongst the jews till the overthrow of the temple 
and that by speciall dispensation from god 
for if the observation of the day had been utterly abrogated 
as a thing unlawfull to be kept 
he would never have charged them to pray against that time of flight 
as a thing unfit and burdensome

according to the constant judgment of divines 
that the ceremonies of the law were de jure abrogated by the death of christ 
but de facto their use ceased not altogether 
till the utter eversion of the city and temple

it doth not appeare in scripture or other waies 
that the apostles did teach the jews necessarily to lay aside the observation of the carnall commandements 
till the day of their buriall came 
when the lord should from heaven declare 
that they were no longer pleasing unto him 
for when certain of the sect of the pharisees who did believe 
went forth 
and coming to antioch 
taught 
that it was necessary for the gentiles to be circumcised 
and to keep the law of moses 
paul and barnabas disputed against them 
and continued still teaching the gentiles 
not onely that they were not bound to observe the laws of moses 
but that the observation of those laws and ordinances which were necessarily to be abrogated 
was in them altogether unlawfull 
this they preached concerning the gentiles onely 
not touching the jews 
and therefore paul coming to jerusalemact 
2122 
23 
24 
when he plainly understood from james 
how his doctrine was misreported 
as though he had taught all the jews which were amongst the gentiles to forsake moses 
he was contented by his actions to make it apparent 
that those flying reports were untruecalvin

and that he himself being a jew kept the law 
and walked orderly 
even as they did 
but as for the gentiles 
they altogether disallowed in all them all conformity with the jews 
in those things which were of necessity to have an end by the coming of christ 
and therefore when peter withdrew himselfe from the gentiles at antioch 
and conformed to the jews 
paul withstood him to his face 
and when other false brethren would have compelled titus to be circumcisedgal 
22 
3 
4 
he withstood them boldly 
and gave no place unto them 
no not for an houre 
neither fearing their offence 
nor dreading their malice 
nor shrinking for peace 
wherefore the erroneous conceit of the obstinate 
misbelieving 
ignorant or weak believing jews 
touching these ceremonies 
or the avoidance of persecution stirred by the malicious 
were not the reasons that simply moved the apostles to conforme unto them 
but they perfectly understood it to be the good pleasure of god to beare with the jews frailty for a time 
and knowing it to be their duty in such and such cases 
to please them 
and not to trouble the church 
they with all
readinesse and not upon constraint submitted themselves 
when those circumstances did occurre

is it not lawfull for a wise man to use simulation or dissimulation in some matters

it is lawfull for a prudent man to conceale some part of the truth

what communication he had with the king 
onely he telleth them 
that he had intreated him 
that he might not returne to jeonathans house to die there 
but the rest of the conference he uttered not 
when the kinsmen of our saviour urged him ambitiously to go up to the feast of tabernaclesjoh 
768 
he answereth them 
my time is not yet 
go ye up to the feast 
i will not go up 
this negation of christ 
which seemes to be simple 
must be understood according to the opinion of his kinsmen 
that is 
he would not go up to purchase humane glory to himself 
but to prevent mistaking 
there are foure things in the act of semblance or dissimulation to be observed 
the minde of him that dissembleth 
the thing or subject wherein 
the manner 
and the end 
if all these be good and lawfull 
the dissimulation it selfe cannot be condemnedvid

if any one be evill 
the dissimulation is evill 
if it come from a distrustfull minde 
doubting of gods providence 
it is sinne 
not so 
if in things lawfull it be used onely as a meanes 
the heart still depending upon the lord 
in matters of religion 
in which the glory of god 
and the salvation of our selves and our neighbours is handled 
there is no place for dissimulation 
but in civill 
externall 
and politick things it may be used 
if the root 
manner 
and end of it be allowableluk 
2428 
29 
so our saviour used a kinde of semblance 
when to take triall of the disciples humanity 
he made shew 
as though he would have gone furthergal 
213 
but peter offended 
was justly reproved of paul 
that in a religious matter dissembled 
withdrawing himself from the gentiles 
with whom he had eaten before 
for feare of them of the circumcision 
in the manner of dissimulation heed must be taken 
that nothing be done in fraud of the truth 
and love in things of truth 
nor of justice 
and our vocation in matters of right and wrong 
whether the semblance be serious or in another kinde 
also respect must be had to the persons 
before whom and towards whom we make semblance 
for it is one thing to make semblance or use dissimulation before the ignorant 
another before men of knowledge 
it is one thing towards the weake 
another towards the strong 
one thing towards friends 
another towards enemies 
one with the simple 
another with the obstinate 
the end of lawfull dissimulation 
is the edification of the church in generall 
or of the godly in particular 
the finding out of the truth necessary to be known 
the keeping close of the truth unfit and unprofitable to be revealed 
the preventing of danger1 king 
325

and such like 
thus the two women contended before solomon 
touching the living child 
whose he should be 
he used an holy dissimulation to finde out the truth 
but if semblance tend to an evill end 
it is evill

it is necessary in a sort

did they conceale as much as they could

the apostles calling necessarily required 
preaching of the wordmat

and for them to have failed in that duty 
for fear or shame 
or otherwise 
had been to deny their lord and master 
yet were they not so tied to this duty

indeed the worship of god is not to be neglected 
though we cannot performe it without manifest danger of our lives 
but there is no necessity to worship god publikely 
where the truth of god is persecuted

that it is both lawfull and expedient for christians to fly in the time of persecution 
but how farre 
and in what cases it is lawfull for the ministers of the gospel 
we shall consider hereafter

they must not fill the world with cries and clamours

first 
in all these 
men must not seeke themselves 
but the lord 
i would have you wise unto that which is good

he would not have them sit idle 
but preach the gospel in other placesmat

for verily 
saith he 
i say unto you 
ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel 
till the sonne of man be come

he preached in galilee 
and paul sought not ease

seeking the good of the church

2414 
this i confess unto thee

which ought not to be 
for paul sheweth 
that our bodies are the members of christ 
which are not to be given unto an harlot

of bowing the knee 
the corinthians might have excused their doing unto paul thus 
why art thou so vehement against us

another mans sin is imputed to no man

this blame is ascribed and rightly impute unto us

so as 
although the corruption of the sacrifices be not imputed to the communicants 
yet the communicating it selfe 
from which they ought to have kept themselves 
maketh them blame-worthy 
and unlesse the matter were so 
why would not the holy martyrs communicate with the rights of the ethnicks

we must give place to no man

wherefore the malicious neglected 
we must contend for edification

doth carry a shew of denying that truth 
for which we are bound to contend 
we must rather adventure any danger

when daniel knew that the king of persia made a decree 
that no man should aske any petition of any god or man 
for thirty daies 
save of the king he went into his house 
and his windows being open in his chamber towards jerusalem 
he kneeled upon his knees 
three times a day 
and prayed and gave thanks before his god 
as he did aforetime 
and it was expedient for daniel thus to do 
otherwise he had sinned against god

unlesse the equity 
and truth 
and dignity of that cause for which we undertake the combate 
be well and throughly understood

if we addict our selves to the pleasures

we can never stand couragiously in the cause of god 
3 
we must nourish in our breasts 
an holy zeal of gods glory 
and pure religion 
that the testification 
exercise 
and furtherance of it 
be dearer to us then life it selfe

if we permit that to our selves 
that declining from the word of god 
we will hear our selves 
we are in danger to runne into no small inconveniences 
the best course for our own ease and safety

to trusse up our thoughts

it must be our wisdome to prevent their plots and traines

so near as we can 
how wisely did jacob prevent the fury of his brother esau 
the scribes and pharisees watched whether christ would heale on the sabboth day 
or no 
to finde accusation against him 
our saviour for all this omitted not to do good 
but in doing it by his question unto them 
cut off so farre as might be the matter of their malice by clearing the lawfulnesse of the fact 
giving us to understand 
that as the wicked watch to traduce us 
so must we watch to cut off occasions of entrapping 
stoutly preparing withall to beare whatsoever the lord measureth out by them 
2 
our saviour would have us wisely decline their fury 
not without just cause provoking them 
it is no wisdome to provoke an evill man 
it is no good discretion to stirre up a lyon 
to take a bear by the tooth 
or a mad dog by the eares 
for they desire nothing more then occasion of contention 
or matter to stirre up their corruption by 
so hezekiah commanded his servants not to answer rabshakeh one word

nothing more vexeth and vanquisheth an adversary then innocency 
no better breast-plate then righteousnesse 
but with harmelessnesse and honesty there must go circumspection and vigilancy 
that we neither advantage the adversary 
nor disadvantage our selves in their presence or absence 
a good cause requires discreet managing

the course of christianity is an exquisite course 
and strict walking 
thus much the word used by the apostle in the place above-cited 
doth import 
as appeareth by other places where it is found 
it seemed good to me 
saith luke 
when i had accurately searched all things 
so herod enquired diligently of the wise men 
and charged them to search exquisitly and most diligently for the babe 
and paul professeth he was brought up according to the most exact manner of the law

according to the true and perfect line of direction 
the word of god in every thing great and small 
so that a man goes to the utmost of them 
and to all the rules that he prescribes 
a circumspect christian ordereth his waies according to the truth 
avoiding all extremities 
not turning aside either to the right hand or to the left 
satan cares not so he can conquer us 
whether it be by curiosity 
or by carelesnesse 
whether he can keep us out of the church 
or cast us out by our own conceits 
whether he can keep us so cold 
as no good thing greatly affects us 
or whether he can make us boile over with unbridled zeal 
that because we cannot have all the good we wouldpsal 
1199 
we will refuse a great deale of good we might have 
but a prudent man will have recourse to the word of life 
and frame his courses according to that rule

a circumspect man looks round about him 
and so ordereth his businesse 
as one hinder not another 
but all may go forward 
and so saveth one commodity 
as another be not lost or lie in hazard 
so a circumspect christian casteth his occasions 
as 
seeing every christian duty is enjoyned him 
he hath respect to gods commandements 
and that in the extremity thereof 
duties of piety shall not justle out duties of civility 
nor civill duties eate out duties of piety 
but as one hand helpes another 
so one duty shall prove fit for another 
one calling forward another 
he fears as 
the committing of the least sinne 
so the neglect
of any duty of piety or mercy that god requireth 
he loathes to do the work of god by half chare2 pet

psal 119105 his zeal shall not out-runne his knowledge 
his providence shall not lessen his faith 
nor his faith destroy his providence 
he will use the meanes that god offereth 
but rest in the lord 
peace fitteth him for trouble 
and adversity prepares him to live in peace 
his love with mens persons brings him not into love with their sinnes 
and his hatred of their sinnes 
impeacheth not his love of their persons 
he sheweth mercy without folly 
and executeth justice without cruelty 
he reverenceth men of place and gifts 
but will not be drawn to sinne by their example or counsell 
for feare of their displeasure 
or to winne their favour 
he keepes his heart in an holy temper and disposition to obey the lords call in every thing 
and to do whatsoever he requireth 
and that in the highest degree he is able 
to the least jot 
all his graces runne in a circle 
move 
strengthen 
and quicken each other 
his soule is fixed upon the lord 
and ever moveth as he goeth before it 
thus he is busie in maintaining his heart in good plight 
exercising all his graces 
all of them being of great use 
and flowing from the same spirit 
and conscionably cherishing all buds 
and blossomes of obedience 
that spring from those severall graces

exquisitnesse imports diligence to redeeme 
seeke 
observe and take opportunities of doing good 
walke circumspectly 
not as fools 
but as wise 
redeeming the time 
because the daies are evill 
a circumspect man watcheth all occasions for his own good and advantage 
and if they be offered 
slips them not 
so a circumspect christian looks round about him 
and thinkes it not sufficient to take occasions of grace and wel-doing 
being offered 
but will seeke them 
yea 
redeeme them with double diligence 
the thrifty husband 
merchant or tradesman 
is not so carefull to have his stock employed for increase 
as the wise and wary christian is to employ what grace he hath received to the glory of god 
the good of others 
and his own spirituall furtherance and advantage 
he is grieved if at any time he overlooke his opportunity 
and by losse is made wise 
more narrowly to consider and observe the seasons 
that offer themselves for the doing or getting of good 
there is no time 
state 
condition 
or company 
but some way or other a discreet and wary dealer in the course of christianity will improve it to his own behoofe 
and work profit out of it for the good of his own soul 
4 
exactnesse reacheth to the manner of doing 
as well as to the thing it selfe to be done 
a circumspect christian considereth all circumstances that belong to a good work 
as time 
place 
order and manner of doing 
together with the inward affection and disposition of the soul 
and is carefull that all may be right 
5 
exactnesse must be constant at all times 
he that walkes by halves or by fits is not exact
q 
what are the speciall furtherances of this exquisitnesse
a 
1 
a sound knowledge of the right way 
which is as the light 
guiding to set every foot safely 
for let a man be never so circumspect and wary 
if he be in the night 
without light 
and without a guide 
he can never walke securely and safe 
the word is the lanthorn 
and the commandement is the light 
in the darkenesse of this world 
the word of god is as a light illuminating our eyes 
and shewing the true way wherein we ought to walke 
that we turne not aside into by-pathes 
or dash upon the rocks of humane errorpro 
210 
11 
when wisdome enters into the soul 
and knowledge delighteth the soul 
then shall counsell 
ʋnderstanding shall keep thee 
to deliver thee from  the way of the evill mana man cannot be a practicioner in any profession except he know it 
much lesse in the profession of christianity 
2 
a diligent watch and care to prevent sloath and keepe from all extremities 
we are apt to nap in our businesse 
or step into extremities 
on the right hand or on the left 
either to neglect good 
or
to cast away the good with the evill 
and refuse them both 
either to deale sleightly in the work of god 
or to make conscience where we should not 
we are all generally of a very dull and drowsie disposition 
by reason of that lumpish flesh of ours 
by meanes whereof it cometh to passe that we are oft sleeping and slumbering 
be we never so carefull and diligent 
yea 
in danger oft 
after we have been awaked out of this drowsie and deadly sleep 
to fall eftsoone back againe into the same 
if we keepe not a constant watch over our selves and our souls 
and as men newly awakened by some suddain fright 
do runne up and down they know not whither 
so it is with us 
being rouzed from security 
we are ready to turne aside into divers by-paths untill we returne to our former sluggishnesse 
for it is much easier to passe from one contrary extreme to another 
then to stand fast in the straight way that leadeth unto life 
such as travell in slippery paths 
or waies troublesome to be found 
are carefull to look to their feet 
observe their markes and turnings 
so must it be with him 
that will travell safely through the slippery and dangerous way of this worlds wildernesse 
3 
a due and carefull examination of our  affections to the things we go about 
and of our severall actions flowing from them 
least we be otherwise unawares overtaken with sinne in them 
ponder 
saith solomon 
the paths of thy feetprov 
426

he cannot be regardlesse of his heart 
which is the fountaine of all actions good and evill 
let every man prove himself 
and try his work 
before he set upon it 
that he may have good assurance of the lawfulnesse of it 
both in it selfe 
and in regard of circumstances 
and manner of doing 
a bad affection may marre a good work 
but a good affection cannot justifie an evill action 
therefore both the heart and act must be brought into the light 
and examined by it 
to this duty the apostle seemeth to have an eye 
when he prayeth for the philippiansphil 
110 
that they might try things that differ 
and that they might be sincere 
such whose hearts and workes would endure the light of the sunne

looke first and then leape 
see the ground be firme 
and then tread upon it safely 
4 
an holy jealousie and suspicion 
lest  the heart be deceived through the deceitfulnesse of sinne 
the most simple-hearted christian is a most wary man 
suspecting his heart 
least it should be drawn aside 
for he knoweth sinne lies in ambush to beguile 
the world is full of allurements 
and his heart is ready to listen unto their cunning insinuations 
which maketh him to look to his waies with more then double diligence 
as he that is very circumspect for the world 
is most suspicious of himselfe 
least he be over-seen 
and of others 
least they over-reach and beguile him 
so one that is most circumspect for heaven 
doth suspect himselfe at all times 
and in all occasions overlooke his heart 
least it should start aside 
and turne out of the way 
this godly jealousie of our selves and feare of our infirmity 
will make us carefull to eschew all occasions of sinne 
and whatsoever by meanes of our weakenesse may become matter of evill unto us 
for as those that know themselves to be of a weake stomack 
ready to take check at such meates as many other ordinarily 
are wont to digest well enough 
are very chary of their diet 
and carefull to forbeare 
not such meates onely as are simply unwholesome 
but even such also as they suspect or suppose to be of hard digestion 
and will not in that regard so well accord with their weakenesse 
so the man that is suspicious of himselfe 
and jealous of his own corruption 
will be carefull to walke warily 
and diligently to avoid 
not those things alone that he seeth and knoweth to be simply evill 
and in that regard prejudiciall to all in generall 
but even those things also
that 
though indifferent 
and in themselves otherwise not unwarrantable 
such as may be done by some sometime without hurt or offence 
yet that in regard of the strength of his corruption 
his naturall disposition 
the weakenesse of grace in him 
and his pronenesse to slip and to be overtaken in them 
may in that regard prove dangerous and prejudiciall to him in particular 
howsoever others might without danger deale with them 
againe 
this holy jealousie makes us fly from all appearance of evill 
as from a serpent 
narrow over-looking is the best meanes to keep the sloathfull servant from idlenesse 
the jealous eye of the husband warneth the wife to shame and avoide all shews of unfaithfulnesse 
and this is the effect of godly selfe-jealousie in respect of sinne 
and whatsoever carries any semblance of it 
further 
this jealousie of our own weaknesse not make us the more carefull 
to use diligently all good meanes 
whereby we may be supported and strengthened against all occasions which we cannot avoide 
for the more conscious men are to themselves of their own wants 
the more diligent are they wont to be in resorting to those by whom their wants may be supplied 
and the more suspicious we are of our own infirmity and weakenesse 
the more carefull will we be daily and hourely to repaire unto him2 tim

and surely in this kinde 
it is more behovefull for a man to be somewhat too fearefull and heedy 
then to be a little too confident and fool-hardy 
to take notice of his own weaknesse 
that he may become strong

have undertaken to serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the daies of our life 
and without stint or limitation 
to go to the utmost in every command 
and if in one thing we obey because god commandeth 
and he hath promised it 
why not in this also 
2 
we must all appeare before the throne of god 
to give an account of those things that we have done in the flesh 
be they good or evill 
at the day of judgement men must give an account of every idle word

we need not be so straight-laced 
as to say with david 
i will looke to my waies

ought not we to ponder and sift them them againe and againe 
3 
the wicked amongst whom we live are ready to take all advantages 
and watch for our haltings 
both to harden themselves 
and reproach through us the holy and pure religion of god 
for if they can scorne and deride the servants of god for wel-doing 
and religious actions 
how would they triumph and glory in the falls of any of gods worthies 
hence was the exhortation of the apostle 
col

walke wisely towards them that are without and phil

15 
do all things without murmurings 
and disputings 
that ye may be blamelesse

among whom ye shine as lights in the world 
4 
the way to heaven is full of snares 
crosses 
and dangers 
by reason of our enemies 
and therefore requires all our diligence 
either to avoide them 
or wisely to step over them 
we can be very wary in the dangerous waies of this world 
to take direction or company 
and armour 
and the day light to further us 
and why not in this way to heaven 
besides 
it is a narrow way 
and on high 
all which makes it the more perilous to decline from it 
how circumspect had he need to be 
that walkes upon an high narrow rocke 
or sailes betwixt two dangerous gulfes 
where it is as perillous to slip 
as easie to turne aside 
and both at hand 
if more then common heed be not taken 
5 
this strict course of life is the onely safe and prosperous way 
psal 
1196 
then shall i not be confounded 
when i have respect to all thy commandememts 
then shalt thou prosper 
if thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes and judgements 
which the lord charged moses with concerning israel

for god walketh in the middest of them that keepe his commandements 
and do them 
and keepeth covenant of mercy with them 
that love him and walke in his statutes 
it is now time for us to cast off the workes of darknesse 
ignorance and lust 
and to put on the armour of life

and the day is at hand 
and our salvation is nearer then when we believed 
though men in the night take rest 
and sleep unapparelled 
not passing for uncomelinesse 
yet in the day they go out to
labour 
and have care of civill decency 
and christians 
whose night is past 
who live in the peepe and breake of the day 
must settle themselves as is beseeming for the day 
againe 
such who are now nearer the fruit and end of their faith and love 
such must be more diligent in the works of them 
for the end of every thing is of such force 
that the nearer we come to it 
we do with more courage and diligence ply the meanes which do bring unto it

unadvisednesse 
shame himselfe for it

how have i erred from thy commmandements 
neglected wisdome

passing by thy holy precepts 
as a strange thing 
before men 
i have been carefull to carry my selfe warily 
that i might not incurre disgrace 
advantage mine adversaries 
and bring trouble upon my own head 
but o lord 
i have not regarded thy presence 
i have been negligent in thy service 
wherein all diligence and circumspection is too little 
many times i have been drawn away with the pleasures and profits of this world 
oft distempered with passions 
not seldome hindered with sluggishnesse 
that i have altogether served satan 
or wholly left thy work undone 
and if at any time i have gone about what thou requirest 
how slightly have i done it 
with what remissenesse of heart 
dulnesse of spirit 
as if i had gone about some dead taske 
to which i was not obliged by any duty 
in which no profit could be reaped 
no pleasure taken 
if my childe or servent should returne such duty 
tender such service to me 
that am a worme 
and no man 
could i take it well 
if i speake 
and they stand still 
if i admonish once or twice 
and they shew no respect 
how am i moved to displeasure 
how do i take on as grievously wronged 
o lord 
i am ashamed 
that i should offer that hard measure unto thy holinesse 
that i a base silly creature 
would not receive at the hands of another 
secondly 
he must quicken himselfe to more diligence and heedfulnesse for the time to come 
o my soul 
thou hast too long been in security 
been indulgent to thy corrupt affections 
and foolishly pursued earthly vanities with double diligence 
whilest the practice of piety and justice hath been cleane forgotten 
and almost buried in oblivion 
now therefore awake from sleep 
shake off sloath

looke upon the men of this world 
how do they observe their marts 
faires

by their wisdome and forwardnesse be thou incited to shew more circumspection in matters of singular importance

34q what things are implied in this integrity or perfection
a 
1 
integrity implies a throughout holinesse 
an heart wholly and inseparably cleaving unto the law of god in all things 
1 thes 
523 
when all the powers of the soul are sanctified to every holy duty 
and have a spirituall continuity amongst themselves 
that they all incline and move to all duties of piety and justice 
then is the heart perfect 
the body is intire when all parts are so knit together 
that each is preserved 
the soul is intire 
when all the parts of piety and righteousnesse are riveted together in it 
and in the whole 
thus to serve god in integrity of heart 
and with the whole heart is one and the same for substance 
secondly 
it noteth intirenesse of conversation according to the law of god 
in every place 
state and condition of life 
blessed are the perfect in the way 
that is 
who live intirely in this life 
and in conversation are unblemished 
and they that walke thus in their integrity 
are said to be holy 
harmelesse 
unblameable 
without fault 
unblemished 
perfect 
well set in joynt 
but
on the contrary 
the wicked double-minded 
such as in rest externall work of piety 
or depart from the commandement of god 
are said not to cleave unto the lord with perfect hearts 
or all their hearts 
as it is not of abijan 
that his heart was not perfect with the lord his god 
and of amaziah 
ʋzziah 
jotham 
they did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
but not with perfect hearts 
yet 
of solomon 
that when he was old 
his wives turned away his heart after other gods 
and his heart was not perfect with the lord 
as was the heart of david his father

a woman may love many as friends 
but one as an husband 
if god he wholly ours 
we must be wholly his 
and if we joyne ought with god 
or take in ought with him 
we do not 
we cannot cleave to him alone when there are objects upon which the heart is set 
divided 
the intire shall dwell in the lords sanctuary 
psal

it is required of us in the covenant of grace 
walke before me 
and be perfect 
the most holy god will never marry himselfe to a spirituall adulteresse 
that doth affect any other more or besides him 
men of divided hearts can have no fellowship or communion with god 
2 
integrity is the qualification of a subject capable of remission of sins and eternall blessednesse through grace 
blessed is the man whose iniquity is forgiven 
and whose sin is covered 
blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth no sinne 
and in whose spirit there is no guile 
3 
god will passe by the imperfections which he espieth in the best service of his children 
when once he seeth their hearts to be intire and perfect towards him 
hypocrisie drowneth many excellent graces 
and causeth god to take no notice of them 
but sincerity is so well pleasing to his majesty 
that if it be not shaken 
he will not see many other infirmities 
this is the challenge against the church of sardis 
i have not found thy works perfect before god 
david had many imperfections 
and through infirmity did often sin against the law 
but he is not accused to break the whole law in any thing 
save in the matter of ʋriah 
the holy ghost hath noted sundry defect in asa 
but addeth this of him by way of conclusion 
yet his heart was perfect towards the lord all his daies 
contrarily in jehu 
after a large description of many excellent things 
it is observed 
but jehu regarded not to walke in the law of the lord with all his heart 
and so his service in destroying ahabs house 
was reckoned murther 
hezekiah is bold to pray in behalfe of them that came unprepared to the passover 
2 chro 
301519 
the good lord be mercifull to him that prepareth his whole heart to seek the lord god 
though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary 
an husband will beare with many aberrations in the behaviour of his wife so long as he is perswaded of the intirenesse of her heart towards him 
so dealeth the lord with them that feare before him with all their hearts 
4 
the perfect shall not be confounded 
let my heart be intire in thy statutes 
that i be not ashamed 
for god will not cast away a perfect man 
neither will he take the wicked by the hand 
he may seeme to neglect 
he doth forget them that follow after holinesse 
he is thought to favour 
he doth abhorre the workers of wickednesse and sinne 
5 
the eyes of the lord runne to and fro throughout the whole earth 
to shew himselfe strong in the behalfe of them 
whose heart a perfect towards him 
howsoever they may be weake in themselves 
in him they shall be victorious 
his power shall be perfited in their weakenesse 
for as it is in the psalme 
with the perfect 
thou wilt shew thy selfe perfect 
thou wilt not faile him in his need 
this is the nature of god 
that he frameth himselfe to the dispositions of men 
good to the good 
hard to the stubborne

the lord god will withold no good thing from them that walke in integrity 
for he is both their sunne and shield 
he will give grace and glory 
as the sunne doth illustrate 
cherish and quicken all things with its heate and light 
so doth the lord visit the upright 
and refresh them by his spirit 
yea 
and as with a shield 
protect them from all evill 
10 
integrity addes to the glory of our good actions 
even such as are but of the lower sort 
there is not the meanest duty whatsoever 
which integrity will not set a faire glosse upon 
that in some respects it shall be matchable even to workes farre greater in their own nature 
a poor labouring man that lives by his hands 
having performed holy obedience to god therein with an intire heart 
may have as much comfort on his death-bed 
as the best minister or magistrate 
whose service it selfe is farre more honourable 
yea 
if his integrity be greater 
his comfort also shall be greater 
for god regards not so much the matter 
as the forme of obedience 
not so much the thing done 
as the affection wherewith we do it 
wise men regard more the minde of the giver 
then the value of the gift 
when we give our hearts wholly and intirely first to god 
then is our service how small soever 
very acceptable to his majesty 
it is not the greatnesse or multitude of those good workes which we have done 
but the good disposition of an honest and intire heart in the doing of them 
that doth bring comfort 
as the internall qualification of that faith which makes a sound plea for mercy before the throne of grace 
the psalmist pronounceth them blessed 
that walke in the undefiled way 
he makes no choice of the way 
he doth not say 
blessed are they that are upright in the way of the ministery or the magistracy 
but speaking indifferently of any way allowable by the word

blessed are the undefiled in the way

o lord 
remember how i have walked before thee in truth 
and with a perfect heart 
this was his refuge 
though those good works he had done were in regard of his calling of the highest note 
the restoring of the true worship of god 
the purging of the defiled temple and priest-hood

but in the perfection of his heart

against which no batteries of the enemy can prevaile

who will not be daunted with any proud on-set of the adversary 
which he knoweth to be weake and of no strength

12 
an intire heart is a channell or barke in which the graces of the spirit are contained 
and faith doth swimme above all stormes and tempests 
but a minde void of integrity 
is full of slifters or chinckes 
that if the most holy liquor of piety be offered 
it is powred in and out together 
and at once 
if the worke of grace be imperfect in parts 
let it grow up never so fast 
it can never be perfect or intire 
if the plant be imperfect 
it will never be a perfect tree 
an heart unsanctified or that makes a major part against it selfe 
cannot truly serve god 
this is the nature of integrity 
that by it the soul is intire in it selfe 
and hath a spirituall continuity 
which may be shadowed forth by the similitude of things corporall 
and therefore so long as integrity is preserved 
the heart is apt to continue and keepe safe the graces of the spirit 
if it be cracked grace would be lost 
should not god make up the breaches of it 
a soul destitute of piety is starke dead 
an heart without integrity is next to death or destruction

by what meanes is this integrity to be attained and preserved
a 
integrity is the gift of god 
infused into the heart by the holy ghost 
but we may not in this respect neglect the meanes which he hath ordained for the attainment and preservation of it 
god 
and none but he 
did place david in the hill sion 
and gave gideon victory over the midianites 
as they both well knew and firmely believed 
but their belief hereof did not emasculate their mindes 
or i their hands from using such strength and valour as they had 
1 
care must
be had to furnish the minde with affectionate knowledge of god in christ jesus 
and thou solomon my sonne 
know thou the god of thy fathers1 chro 
289 
and serve him with a perfect heart 
the knowledge of god begets in us a similitude of god 
when we come to understand what he is to us 
we are made to him what he requireth 
as sound knowledge entreth 
it stampeth the image of god upon the heart 
for it assimilates the minde to the object seene and discerned 
2 
all holy meanes must be used to incorporate the word into the heart 
that it may season every affection 
and beare mild universall sovereignty over us 
for when the heart is transformed throughout into the nature of the word 
and every power of soul is brought into subjection by an unfained 
sovereigne 
wel-rooted faith 
it is intire in parts 
though imperfect in degrees 
herein all diligence and paines must be taken 
by preparation 
hearing 
meditation 
and observation of all unexpected occasions of griefe 
sorrow 
feare 
joy or such like 
to bring the word into the affections 
that it may sweeten their disposition 
and governe their motion 
3 
in all endeavours we must include prayer to god in the name of christ as a chiefe associate 
for god ordinarily lets in sanctifying grace at the same gate 
at which honest hearty prayers go out 
4 
the fourth meanes is for a man alwaies to possesse his heart with the apprehension of gods presence 
and so to keep it in his feare continually 
to walke with god as being in his eye 
and seeing him that is invisible 
this remembrance of gods all-seeing presence will make men study to approve themselves before god in all their courses 
and to sticke unto him with their whole hearts 
could the eye of a jealous husband prie into every privy corner of his wives heart 
she would be afraid to hide any strange lover in her secret affection 
if but a man 
nay 
if but a childe could looke into our hearts 
we durst not deale doubly and deceitfully 
what 
god sees us 
and shall we durst to dally with him 
shall i give him part of my heart 
and reserve another part for the world 
for pleasure 
for sinne 
how should not god finde this out 
for he searcheth the heart and reines 
and understandeth the secret cogitations of every soul 
5 
the fifth meanes is diligently to review all workes of obedience 
and our affections in the doing of them 
and to observe what discomfort and trouble followes the maimed and defective performance of good duties 
and withall 
when we take our selves 
in an holy indignation to take revenge of our selves 
judgeing and condemning our selves before god 
the very thinking of the after-reckonings we must come to 
when we have done our worke 
will make us take heed how we do it 
the remembrance of the losse and punishment that he shall sustaine 
whose workes are not perfect before the lord 
will stirre up respect to every commandement 
for who is there that useth for all his actions 
at the daies end to call himself to a severe examination 
as the hard master doth his servants 
that must not needs 
in the very middest of his actions reason thus with himself 
anon all this which now i do 
must very narrowly be looked over 
if the reason why i do it 
my affections in doing 
and the work it selfe be maimed 
halt 
or suffer defect in the parts thereof 
i shall smart for it 
o the wrings and secret pinches which mine own guilty heart will give me 
yea 
the sentence which by my own covenant 
i am tied to passe upon my selfe 
in case my heart be partiall to the lord 
and my work deformed 
if my work be not perfect 
shall i not loose all my labour 
and be rejected with it 
lastly 
it is good to meditate seriously upon the joyes of heaven 
and the rich recompence of reward that is reserved for them 
that cleave unto god with their whole heart 
if the happinesse of the saints hereafter do rightly affect 
and be soundly believed 
a man will be contented to part with all that he hath to purchase that treasure 
whatsoever he hath laid next his heart 
he will abandon it with detestation 
rather then deprive himselfe of that eternall inheritance 
which god hath prepared
q 
how should a christian stirre up himself to strive after perfection more and more
a 
first 
he must shame himselfe for his halting 
and make it odious 
ah 
the division of my heart 
the maimednesse of my service is so apparent 
that i cannot conceale from my conscience 
i have lodged sinne 
vanity 
pleasure 
the world in the closet of my heart 
which should have been kept intirely for the lord 
my purposes for good are weak 
my resolutions variable 
oft-times by occurences and occasions i have been drawn aside 
in the performance of good duties i have served mine own corrupt affection 
and doing what is right 
not done it with a perfect heart 
mine affection to good hath been partiall 
base

the wicked are said to be a froward generation 
children in whom is no faith

are called faithfull

truth of judgment goeth before truth of heart 
2 
truth implies soundnesse or solidity in grace 
opposite to those superficiall or shallow-planted graces 
which may be found in the temporary christian 
enduring but for a time 
this is truth in the reines or inward parts 
which seasoneth the heart throughout 
and makes it true 
whereas the heart of the temporary christian is false and unsound 
because his graces are sleightly rooted 
though true for substance

truth is opposed to lying and falshood 
as also to legal rites 
figures and shadows 
in which senses it may be applied to this purpose 
as not in a plaine simplicity opposite to lying and empty shewes 
and thus to obey from the heart 
and to serve god in spirit 
is to serve god in truth or sincerity without dissimulation 
if any will purpose to shew this in some things 
yet not resolve to shew it in all 
even this is the man 
who is farre from sincerity 
4 
it notes a pure or cleare-shining innocency in all things 
free from the mixture of leaven in manners or doctrine 
the apostle peter writeth to the dispersed jews 
to stirre up their pure mindes 
what is that but mindes furnished and seasoned with an holy perspicuity of truth 
therefore paul prayeth for the philippians 
that they might abound in knowledge 
and in all judgment 
that they might be able to discerne things that differ 
that they might be sincere 
the word used by the apostles in both places 
signifieth properly something tried by the light of the sunne 
and it is a metaphor 
as some suppose 
taken from the custome of the eagle 
whose manner is 
if we may believe those that write the naturall story 
to bring her young out of the nest before they be full fledge 
and to hold them forth against the full sight of the sunne 
the sight whereof those of them that can with open eye endure 
she
retaineth and bringeth up as her own 
the rest that cannot brooke it 
and winke at it 
she rejecteth and casteth off as a barstardly brood 
others think it rather taken from the usuall practice of chapmen in the view and choice of their wares 
a wise wary chapman that hath to do with a deceitfull merchant 
draper 
or other 
one that keepeth his wares in obscure places 
where the defects of them cannot so easily be discerned 
or hath false lights that may helpe to give a counterfeit glosse to them 
he will take no ware of him upon his word 
but will first diligently view it 
tosse it and turne it 
to and fro 
over and over 
try how it is in the middest as well as at both ends 
bring it forth into the light 
hold up his cloath against the sunne 
see if he can espie any defect or default in it 
he knoweth he may easily else be over-reached 
the like must be our practice2 cor

as may endure the triall of the light 
thus the apostle joyneth sincerity and truth together 
as one and the same 
or as the speciall and generall 
sincerity being a branch of truth 
5 
it imports firmenesse and constancy in every holy duty of our generall or personall calling 
of piety or righteousnesse 
a faithfull spirit is steadfast with god 
the ground of declining is lack of truth 
their heart was not with him 
neither were they steadfast in his covenant 
if the heart be not true 
what shew soever a man makes 
yet he is but like an apple rotten at the coare 
or as an house built upon the sand 
the one of which though it be beautifull will soone putrifie 
the other though it be fairely set 
yet will quickly fall 
a man may have many worthy gifts 
yet if he want sincerity 
upon a suddain may be taken from himmat 
1312

both that which he hath 
and that which he seemes to have 
and his end be as the figge-trees 
which making onely a shew with leaves having no fruit 
being cursed 
lost even those also 
and withered away by degrees 
being good for nothing but the fire 
but grace powred into an honest and sound heart 
will abide for ever 
the course of a true christian is permanent and continueth to the end
q 
judas and many others that have fallen away were men worthily endowed 
beyond many christians that be true and sound-hearted
a 
we must distinguish sound 
wel-rooted and constant grace 
received into a true heart 
from fained or temporary 
the wicked have streames of graces often 
but they have not the fountaine of grace in them 
they have not lively communion with christeph 
317 
as the godly have 
and therefore their graces wither 
it is a true living faith that maketh christ to dwell in the heart 
and this is the cause why our grace lasteth 
though we finde ebbs 
by daily experience 
and this water to runne exceeding low 
yet having the well-head in us 
and renewing our faith on him the quickening spirit 
rivers do afresh runne out of our bellies 
and the current of grace as high as before 
the temporizer though he have a streame of grace 
yet wanting the fountaine to feed it 
it must needs dry away 
as those streames or ponds which have no spring nor head of water to maintaine them 
cannot continue 
again 
the wicked have many graces true for substance 
but not truly planted 
and therefore their hearts are never sound 
for they receive the grace they have 
retaining their interest in the world 
and the pleasures and profits thereof 
or some notorious sinne 
or course in lesser evils 
wherein they never seriously 
deliberatly 
constantly purpose reformation 
evermore some inferiour good is laid closer to the heart 
and hath deeper rooting therein 
then the word of promise 
and this maketh grace it cannot be held with them 
for as a stomack ill affected with choler 
though never so wholesome meates be received into it 
yet it cannot hold them 
but is provoked to cast 
so where there is this obstruction of the soul 
the wilfull love of any sinfull course 
or subordination of grace to boisterous 
distempered 
earthly passions 
whatsoever grace is received into the heart 
it will not let it rest 
but
maketh the soul cast it up upon all occasions
q 
what reasons may shew the necessity and use of this truth
a 
1 
sincerity is the girdle whereby all other graces are tied close unto us 
so the apostle in the discription of the spirituall armour 
calls iteph 614 
the girdle of truth 
and therefore here also is true of all men 
that we say of children in the proverb 
ungirt 
unblest 
this girdle hath these uses 
first 
it doth adorne us 
for this was the use of the studded belt 
which the souldiers did weare to hide the gaping joynts of their armour 
which would have been unseemly 
and nothing doth more adorne a soul or beautifie our actions 
and raise admiration in them 
then uprightnesse 
as our saviour commending nathanael 
gave this speech of him 
behold a true israelite in whom there is no guile 
secondlyjoh 
147 
a girdle doth tie other cloathes about us 
which otherwise the winds would blow abroad 
and would hang but loose upon us 
so this girdle of truth doth containe and hold together all other graces 
wherewith the soul is arrayed 
and without truth to keep them together 
in time all of them are blown away with the winde of temptation 
that grace which was not knit together with honesty of heart 
came to nothing in the end 
as appeares in the parable 
the body when the soul is once gone 
may not long stay above ground 
it must needs be buried 
so the hypocrites graces wanting sincerity 
which is the very soule and life of all grace 
they are but a stinking carrion 
and what should an odious ugly carkass do 
but be thrown into the pit 
an unsound horse that hath some secret fault 
may carry as good a shew as the soundest 
and at the first for a mile or two 
will travell as freshly and cheerfully as any 
but at length he tires and gives over 
so it is with an unsound christian 
notwithstanding all his faire beginnings and hopefull entrances 
he continueth not

so this grace addeth great strength to the inner-man

fourthly 
in the easterne countries where they were accustomed to weare long garments down to the ancles 
they used to gird them close unto their body 
when they had any journey 
combate or labour in hand 
least they should be an impediment unto them 
and so to have the loynes girt 
is to be fitted and prepared for any service 
travell 
or conflict 
thus the christian that is girded with truth 
is in readinesse for any good duty 
and to encounter with any adversary power that shall withstand him in the course of godlinesse 
2 
truth of heart is blessed of god with increase of grace 
this it is which maketh the little portion of grace to thrive in the hands of gods children 
their faithfulnesse in a little 
brings them to be owners of a greater deale 
and to be rulers over much 
this brought such a plentifull blessing upon the small beginnings of nathanael 
to whom christ 
because of his truth in the inward affections 
promised an enlarged measure of enlightning 
and that he should see greater things 
this brought such a comfortable increase upon the dimme knowledge of the eunuch and cornelius 
they worshipped god in truth of heart 
according to the measure of understanding which they had received 
in them the promise was accomplished 
to him that hath shall be given 
and he shall have in abundance 
they were led further into that great mystery of godlinesse 
an evangelist being sent of god to the one 
and both an angel 
and an apostle to the other 
3 
sincerity is strengthened of god to be a meanes of comfort to a mans soul in his greatest distresses 
when hezekiah was arrested with the sentence of death by the mouth of the prophet 
here was his comfort 
and that which emboldned him to looke death in the face with more courage 
o lord 
thou knowest
or remember now 
for herein i dare appeale to thy majesty 
that i have walked before thee in truth 
he had done many worthy things in the abolishment of idolatry 
and in the restitution of the true worship of god 
but in none of these simply took he content 
but in the sincerity of his affection in performing them 
so paul in the middest of all his sorrows 
yet this is his rejoycing 
not simply that he had preached 
that he had planted churches 
wrought miracles 
converted sinners 
made sathan to fall down from heaven like lightining 
but that in simplicity and godly sincerity 
he had his conversation in the world 
2 cor

the service of a sound christian is very acceptable to his majesty 
be it to outward shew never so meane and simple 
if servants be obedient to their masters in singlenesse of heart 
they shall receive their reward of the lord 
the lord is nigh to all that call upon him in truth

not the most eloquent prayer 
and best set forth in words 
but the supplication that is breathed from an honest and true heart 
findes best acceptation as in the naturall body 
the case of the sound finger is safer then of the blindish eye 
so in the family of god 
it is better to be a faithfull door-keeper 
and so to be sure to hold our place 
then to be an unfaithfull steward 
and to be thrust out for untrusty dealing 
many actions 
otherwise fervent enough 
for want of this sincerity are but froth 
and cause them who have long pleased themselves therein 
at length to cry out of their doings 
and to say they were but hypocrisy 
5 
a faithfull man shall abound in blessings 
that is 
he that dealeth uprightly and soundly with men 
and is not willing to deceive any in word or deed 
carrying himselfe sincerely toward god 
as he liveth honestly amongst his neighbours 
and that not onely in one matter 
but in all 
and is therefore in the originall text called a man of faithfulnesse 
shall abound in blessings of all sorts

6 
the more sincerity 
the more affinity with god

the more are we 
to speak with the apostle

q 
by what meanes may this truth be attained and strengthened
a 
1 
the general meanes is constant and conscionable dependance upon the preaching of the word 
desire the sincere milke of the word 
1 pet 
21 
he calls the word sincere milkeioh 146 
a milke without deceit 
it is in it selfe truth 
having the god of truth for the authour 
christ jesus the truth for the witness 
the spirit of truth for the composer of it 
and then it workes truth in the hearts of them that hear it 
it is mighty to the purging out of that leaven of fraud which is within us 
joh 
1717 
sanctifie them with thy truth 
thy word is truth 
there is the meanes 
this is it which begets faith 
and faith is that which purifieth the heart 
rom 
1017 
how came the romanes to that heartinesse and sincerity of obedience 
which paul commends so much 
was it not by that forme of holy doctrine which was delivered themrom 
617 
or as we read it sometimes 
unto which they were delivered 
wherein the truth preached is compared unto a mould 
into which they were cast 
and by which they were transposed into a new forme 
enabled to walke sincerely 
and without halting before the lord 
then again it is truly said 
that the heart can never be sincere 
till it be humbled and broken 
and brought to the abasement and deniall of it selfeier 
2329 
and what meanes hath god ordained so effectuall as his word 
to worke this humiliation of spirit 
is not this the hammer which breaketh the stone 
is not this that which pricketh the
heart 
and maketh it to meet 
and sometimes wringeth teares from the eyes of those that hear it 
besidesact 
237 
2 king 
2219 
what hope that ever any mans disease of a false heart should be cured 
untill he be brought to the sight of it 
who seekes for health till he know himselfe to be diseased 
and shall ever any man be brought to the understanding of his defect in this 
untill he hath been made to see it by the word 
further 
what health is to the body 
that truth is to the soul 
now bodily health ariseth from the seed 
is preserved by sound and good diet 
but the sincere word of god 
is that immortall seed whereby we are begotten 
and that spirituall food whereby we are nourished 
2 a second meanes is to possesse our hearts with this 
and to have it ever in our thoughts 
that in all things 
especially in matters of religion 
we have to do with god 
and are ever in his sight and presence 
in our common daily duties to labour this 
to performe them with our heart 
as in the sight of god 
to his glory 
is a ready way to get this grace of truth deeply rooted 
it is the very maine ground of all hypocrisie 
that this one thing is not duely thought on 
men forget him that sees in secret 
and whose eyes are as a flame of fire 
and therewith peirceth further then the outward face 
and hereupon they are apt to imagine 
that when they have carried the matter smoothly and fairely before men 
all his well 
the world either applaudes them 
or not accuseth them 
and hereupon they flatter themselves 
as if all were well 
let us then remember this 
if we would be true and sincere in our hearts 
the waies of man are before the eyes of godprov 
5 21 
and he pondereth all his paths 
this kept the church and people of god of old in their sincerity 
and preserved them from dealing falsly concerning his covenant 
they thought with themselves 
if we do thus and thuspsal 
441721 
shall not god search it out 
for he knoweth the secrets of the heart 
and this consideration moved paul to faithfulnesse in his ministery 
we make not merchandize of the word 
but as of sincerity 
but as of god 
in the sight of god 
speake we in christ 
2 cor 
217 
see what things go together 
doing a matter in sincerity 
and doing it 
as in the sight of god 
3 
it is good to call our selves to a frequent reckoning touching our carriages 
binding our selves to an examination of them 
he that hath a servant of whose fidelity he hath some doubt 
and whom he desires if it might be to reclaime 
both for the good of the party 
and for his own particular also 
that he may be usefull to him 
he will not let him runne on too long before he call him to an account 
he considereth that to be the next way to make him secure and carelesse 
if he expect ever and anon to be reckoned with 
it will cause him so much the more carefully to look unto his businesse 
it is so in this case 
the word of god telleth thee 
that thou hast within thee a false 
a cousening 
a deceitfull heart 
a heart that will beguile thee 
to thine utter ruine 
it is ever ready to practise with sathan 
the professed enemy of thy soul 
to work mischief against thee 
wouldst thou reforme this heart 
that it might become usefull and serviceable for thee in the great and important business of salvation 
be sure to call it often to an account 
it will be good to reckon with it once a day 
to see what hath passed it 
to examine what thoughts have been framed in it 
what purposes 
what intents 
what acts have been done 
as effects and fruits of those inward purposes 
surely this tying of thy selfe to such an often survey and looking backe upon thy heart 
will keep it in so much the more awe 
and when it is once accustomed to the sweetnesse which will be felt 
when it can give account of care 
and of obedience 
and to the smart and punishing which followeth the remembrance of failing in holy duties 
it cannot but be kept in so much the better tune 
4 
a fourth meanes is by considering the blessednesse of sincerity 
and the woefull curse that belongeth to the contrary 
blessed is the man whose heart is faithfull 
it is the delight of god 
but he detesteth nothing so as hypocrisie 
and abhorreth those duties that are not done unto him in soundnesse
q 
what are the effects or evidences of this truth and soundnesse
a 
1 
a sound heart being well informed of the truth of god 
doth heartily resigne it selfe to be guided and directed by the lord in all thingsphil 
110 
as it is noted of ezra 
ezra 710 
that he prepared his heart to seeke the law of the lord2 chro 
3019 
and to do it 
and to teach in israel statutes and judgements 
and from this generall spring these particulars 
first 
truth breedeth an hatred of all false and corrupt opinions in doctrine 
psal 
119128 
i hate every false way 
psal1 king 
1821 
119113 
i hate vaine thoughts or inventions

which is nothing but vaine and lying pompe 
and empty shews 
hos 
1112 
ephraim compasseth me about with lies 
and the house of israel with deceit 
thirdly 
it worketh an universall hatred of all sinne 
that is 
of secret sinnes 
as well as of open sins 
of lesser sinnes 
as well as of greater evils 
of such sinnes as have some speciall enticement 
by some particularity of content or profit 
as well as of those which afford neither 
a true heart hath a constant purpose 
in no one thing 
willingly to sinne against god 
but rather doth endeavour to the utmost in every good way of gods commandements 
and as it stands resolved against all sinne in generall 
both simply considered 
and in respect of all occurences 
whereby he might be allured or compelled thereuntopsal 
1414 
so he is in speciall 
against the sinne to which he findes himselfe most inclined 
or wherewith he hath at any time been overtaken 
4 
it is joyned with a readinesse of minde to acknowledge and lay open every sinne as soone as it is known to be sinne 
and to that end a gladnesse to have the conscience ransacked and ripped up 
that that which is sinne may be found out 
david spake it out of experience 
when he pronounced the man blessed 
in whose spirit there is no guile 
psal 322 
now this was a branch of that spirituall guile 
that he once thought to helpe himself in evill doing 
by holding of his tongue 
as who would say 
he would forget it and passe it over 
but he never was well 
till he was delivered of that false trick 
and fell to the acknowledging of his sinne 
without hiding his iniquity 
he never had comfort 
till he had confest against himselfe his wickednesse 
this he writes for a patterne 
and therefore gives his psalme a title accordingly 
to give instruction this experience taught david to intreate the lord to pry into him 
as fearing himselfe 
that he should deale somewhat over-favourably with himselfe 
psal 
139 23

try me 
o lord 
and know mine heart 
prove me 
and know my thoughtspsal 
1415 
and consider if there be any way of wickednesse in me 
and let the righteous smite me 
for that is a benefit 
and let him reprove me 
when a man loves not those things 
which tend to the discovery of his heart and life 
and to the finding out of his secret evils 
as reprehensions 
whether publique or private 
or serious and earnest confession of sinne before god 
it is a signe of a false heart 
5 
truth dealeth not onely against this or that branch of corruption 
which shooteth out to our disgrace or trouble 
but against the root it self 
as in paul we see 
the law of evill 
which did dwell within him 
was his principall matter of conflict 
it zealously contendeth for the maintenance of gods pure worship and service

in all conditions or estates of life 
in all dealings secret or open 
publique or private 
at home or abroad 
he will carry himselfe as becomes the gospel

froward as courteous 
and all faithfulnesse in things committed to his charge 
even to the least pinne 
though he might do otherwise with secrecy and security from men 
and that willingly
of conscience 
not for hope of credit or gaine

but he will reverence his master

a christian man will be simple

inoffensive in matters of religion 
loving and courteous in all his behaviouract 
246 
and what he would seeme to be towards others in their presence 
that he is inwardly 
and in their absence 
9 true grace is permanent 
and true christians are constant in their course 
not shrinking in temptation 
nor starting aside like a broken bow 
an hypocrite is wavering in respect of occurences 
halting and divided in respect of objects 
in subjection to inordinate passions 
powerlesse in the performance of holy duties 
wise to hide and cover sinne 
glorious in empty shadowes of religion 
apt for advantage to swallow lesser sins without straining 
slippery in earthly dealings 
aiming at wrong ends in the profession of the truth 
indulgent to his beloved and darling sinne 
desirous to seeme religious 
though he much neglect the power of godlinesse 
but the true christian is unlike him in all these respects 
he is sound and constant 
a master of his affections 
a bungler to colour or guild over sinne 
desirous to be good 
and in every thing answerable to that profession that he maketh 
faithfull in his place 
plaine in his dealings 
innocent and harmelesse 
as becomes the child of god 
the same man at home and abroad 
within and without 
openly and in secret 
in thought and discourse
q 
do not the godly oftentimes in the performance of good duties 
looke more at man then at god 
and propound indirect meanes when they should eye his glory onely
a 
they do through frailty and weaknesse 
but we must distinguish of hypocrisie 
as of other sinnes 
for as sinne is reigning 
or not 
so is hypocrisie 
now there may be this 
not reigning hypocrisie in the hearts and consciences of gods people 
david when he said 
psal 
322 
blessed is he in whose spirit there is no guile 
did take himselfe tardy in this evill 
and bradford 
with other of those most holy martyrs 
do much seek pardon of hypocrisie and carnall gospelling 
but no sinne that raigneth not 
must discourage us 
and if we have an unfeigned purpose against it 
if we grieve for it 
if we seeke for strength against it 
it reigneth not 
sathan opposeth sincerity by persecutions 
opprobries and reproaches 
as of pride 
hypocrisie 
dissimulation 
specially when god afflicteth 
job 26 
9 
but the more sathan opposeth the truth 
the more should we be in love with it 
for sathan would not load it with disgraces 
if it were not excellent
q 
doth not the devill labour to foist in this leaven of hypocrisie in our daily course 
that thus by little and little 
he may pick this good seed of righteousnesse out of our hearts
a 
the practice of sathan is apparent 
and our care must be to disappoint him 
here our ressistance is to hold us to our own 
and pray to god to rebuke him
q 
how shall we be able to ferret out the guile of our spirit
a 
first 
consider how carelesse we are of the spirituall action 
in those things we performe 
as in prayer 
hearing the word 
receving the sacraments 
to the spirituall performance of these duties 
is required preparation 
and heavenly disposition of soul 
befitting such actions 
and the majesty of god with whom we have to deale 
as in confession of sinne 
there is required grief 
shame 
meeknesse 
in supplication 
reverence and devotion 
but who doth not slightly passe over these duties 
which is no better then the wiping the outside of the dish 
not looking to that within 
2 
marke 
that in ressistance of sin 
we are more sorry and deale against this or that branch of corruption 
which appeareth to our disgrace 
then against the body of death it selfe 
against one sin
to which we are not inclind 
more then to another to which we are disposed 
3 
marke the course of our affections 
and we shall see how unsound we are towards god and our brethren 
if a thing touch our selves 
our blood will quickly be in our nailes 
if a man do know this or that amisse by us 
it is grievious 
the shame of it much upbraides us 
but things that offend god 
and which we know 
he seeth amisse in us 
we can let these passe nothing affected 
a signe our love to him is not so sound 
our fear of him 
and desire of praise with him 
not so unfaigned 
we should be ashamed to be found often in the same fault before men 
we commit and confesse the same sinnes daily before god 
and are not confounded in our selves 
if we speak an hasty word in the presence of some reverent man 
that might be to our disgrace 
our thoughts trouble us 
but the offence against god is lightly passed over 
we are circumspect to avoide the breach of penall lawes 
not so carefull to prevent transgression against god 
we confesse sin before god 
and seeme to aggravate it 
but being questioned of men 
we turne the faire side outward 
and make the best of it 
if we live in peace and credit 
we think others should not repine 
but we shall finde secret grudgings at the prosperity of others 
we rejoyce at that which should occasion grief 
we grieve at what is matter of joy 
lastly 
let us observe how frequently our actions are corrupted 
in leaving sinne many times 
we leave it not because we hate it as sinne 
but it hath often broken out to our reproach 
our friends perswade to relinquish it 
it will be for our credit and advantage 
we confesse our own sins 
not desiring to give glory unto god 
and gaine a testimony of a sound heart 
but because worldly wisdome doth tell us 
it is best to tell our own tale 
or it were double folly to make dainty of that all the world knoweth 
it will not be for our credit to lessen our fault when it is fully known 
we shall lose the estimation of good men 
if we seek to hide 
excuse or make light of our offences 
our promises of amendment 
when we have been overtaken with sin to our disgrace 
have not proceeded from due consideration 
nor had due execution accordingly 
in the profession of religion we have oft aimed at sinister ends 
as praise of men 
gaine 
or the like 
thus in taking up good duties 
as orders in our family 
we often look not so much at the conscience of gods commandement 
as at this 
the eyes of men are upon us 
all the world will cry shame 
if such things be neglected altogether 
our performance of private duties is far more dull 
superficiall and slight 
that the which is done in the sight of others 
the presence of men doth oft restraine from many hasty sinfull speeches 
and unwarantable actions 
which we take liberty to speak and do before the face of the most high 
and are not ashamed 
our rebukes are carnall 
rather because our mindes are crossed 
then that god is dishonoured 
our obedience is partiall 
this we do 
another thing no lesse materiall we passe over without regard 
yea 
and we meane well many times 
and are fervent in a good thing 
without sinister respects 
and that partly for the commandement of god 
but not onely 
nor resolutely for that 
but more for other considerations then that 
therefore in such cases and trials 
we are found to be others 
if we examine it 
then we would 
we beare with faults in him that is serviceable to our humour 
against another that is not so pleasing in our eye 
we are hot and fiery 
sometime we undertake to deale for some that speak to us 
but do it without any hearty well-wishing to him 
sometime not sticking to say to your friend 
i must speak to you for fashion 
but do as you please 
we visit sick ones 
but not stirring up our bowels of mercy 
we speak a great many phrases of course 
our conscience telling us it is otherwise 
we make a semblance of reverence 
but how far it is from the heart 
this may testifie 
that we can 
absent from the parties 
use their names proverbially 
break jests on them 
admit sinister suspcions 
we can speak faire to mens faces 
when war is in the heart 
and when we hate the person 
take on as if we sought the disgrace of his sin onely 
so in fruites of love 
we can do this party good sometime 
but it is to keep another under 
who else would
sprout forth so far 
that his shade would dimme our lights 
as i will do for such a one 
they know good behaviours 
they will do their homage 
such a one will thanke me for it 
i am sure it will not be given cleane away 
he is able to do me a good turne again 
&ampc
q what must we do after we have found out this unsoundnesse
a 
first 
we must take up our selves for halting 
and bewaile it with shame 
and sorrow 
for thoug there may be some reliques of hypocrisie in a good man 
yet the nature of halting is 
it will go quite out of the way if it be not healed 
heb 
1213 
and make straight steps unto your feet 
least that which is halting be turned out of the way 
ah 
how far am i from that truth which god requires in the inward parts 
what a deale of wicked fraud and deceit is even heaped and piled up within me 
what rottennesse doth lodge still in my breast 
what am i 
but a shop of lies and vanities 
easier it is a great deale to know the number of my haires 
then of the cunning motions and affections of my heart 
oh 
the blinde corners 
the secret turnings and windings 
the close lurking holes that are therein 
upon examination i have found a world of falsnesse in my soule 
more then ever i imagined 
my cogitations are vaine 
my affections unsound 
my aimes indirect 
my course of life palpably grosse in dissimulation before god 
and towards men 
if some loathsome disease had infected my body 
i should be grieved and ashamed at it 
and shall i not mourne for the unsoundnesse of my heart 
if i stood convicted before men for some notorious cousener or deceiver 
i could not but take it grievously 
but many times i have played fast 
and loose in the presence of the all-seeing god 
pretending his service 
when i have done mine own will 
offering him the body 
when the heart hath been let loose after vanity 
secondly 
we must stirre up our selves to be more sound and sincere before the lord 
deceit and falshood is the image of sathan 
who abode not in the truth 
most unmeet to be borne in any degree 
by him that is the sonne of god 
the commandement is 
be ye holy 
for i am holy 
be perfect 
as your heavenly father is perfect 
hereby may we assure our hearts that we are the children of god 
if we be true as he is true 
truth is the image of god 
stamped upon the hearts of them 
whom the lord hath called forth to be his peculiar people 
what health and soundnesse is to the body 
that is sincerity to the soul 
a grace of singular excellency 
and excellent use 
pleasing to god 
and profitable to man 
wise men delight in sound and faithfull friends 
the lord takes pleasure in them that be true-hearted to his glory 
a sound body is fit for labour 
a true heart is ready prepared for any service that god requires 
the way is not tedious to men 
they halt not in it 
but through weaknesse and imperfection 
o my soul 
the way of life would be most pleasant and delihtfull 
crosses easie to be borne 
the comforts of grace most admirable and sweet 
were it not that corrupt humours causing distempers 
do still breed within thee 
earthly desires 
vaine delights 
unruly lusts and passions 
are great impediments to the quick and easie dispatch of our christian pilgrimage 
sincerity is the girdle of the minde to trusse up these 
strengthen our souls 
and tie the heart to the work commanded 
we buy girdles for the body 
and if costly ones 
we keep them carefully 
i will seek to heaven for this girdle of grace 
for it is woven there 
no shop can serve me with it 
but that onely 
thirdly 
we must seek unto god by earnest and hearty prayer 
for every good and perfect gift cometh from above 
psal 
171 
lord 
thou that delightest in the simple and trute-hearted 
that cleave unfainedly unto thy testimonies 
i pray thee create in me a true heart and simple spirit 
that without guile i may stick unto thy statutes 
and do what is acceptable in thy sight 
naturally i am full of falshood and guile 
which i can by no meanes shake off or deny of my selfe 
i come unto thee the god of truth 
that at first didst create me after thy image 
make me every day more and more
like unto thy self in true holinesse and righteousnesse 
lastly 
by faith we must hold jesus christ 
who is the way 
the truth 
and the life 
for the increase of this sincerity 
christ is the fountaine of grace 
of whose fulnesse we partake 
and grace for grace 
whither should the thirsty runne 
but to the fountaine 
then shall i be true indeed 
when the giver of truth dwelleth in my heart 
lord strengthen and confirme my faith 
that being knit unto christ more and more 
i may be stored with his fulnesse

there is none perfectly righteous in respect of grace infused

whereby we rest upon him for strength to master our corruptions

true it is 
paul himselfe did not finde grace fully and perfectly to overcome the rebellion of the old man 
that is 
his corrupt nature 
to the end 
that he might alwaies have a marke of his unworthiness 
and sin remaining in him 
and thereby remember 
that it was of onely mercy that he was pardoned 
and the grace of god that kept him from falling away 
that he might be abased in
himselfe 
and kept humble under so great grace received 
and finde sweetness from time to time in the forgivenesse of his sinnes 
but though he was not perfect here 
as an angell 
yet was he not carried of his lusts into gross iniquity 
he was troubled with the rebellion and resistance of good that he found in the flesh 
but gods grace was sufficient to keep him 
that he fell not into that depth that he might otherwise easily have done 
and we likewise through the same grace in our measure 
may look with good cheere to be delivered from the yeelding to our wicked lusts 
which most dangerously incumber us

and beholding who is upright-hearted towards him 
how weak soever in his own sense and perswasion that he may shew himselfe strong towards him 
and thereby supply his weakness 
and thus the desire to keep a godly course being soundly planted in us 
and the same proceeding from a lively faith 
who doubteth but that we may have strength to do such outward duties as are required 
though weakly 
yet soundly and in truth of heart 
to endeavour at least 
which god will accept 
though we do not alway prevaile over such strong corruptions 
as oftentimes for want of such grace doe master us
q sathan by aggravating our imperfections 
will offer to wring from us the testimony of a good conscience 
in this wise 
gods eye is too pure to behold any evill 
but thy best deeds have been sprinckled with filthiness 
thy own conscience hath condemned thee in them 
god is greater then thy conscience 
&ampc 
how is this to be answered
a 
the answer is by getting a sound knowledge 
how farre we are to stand upon the holiness of our purposes or courses 
of which 
marke these things 
first 
we do not account of it as able to abide the triall of justice 
or to stand for our full righteousness before god 
therefore the things objected may dismay a papist 
they cannot dismay us 
2 
we place the strength of our righteosness in these things 
first 
that it is the qualification of faith whereby we receive remission of sinnes 
or of the subject capable of forgiveness 
for every faith doth not justifie before god 
but that which is lively in operation 
conjoyned with an affection of piety 
2 
that it doth testify of our true faith 
for a work soundly good in any measure 
doth argue an heart good in some measure 
for you cannot have a figge of a thistle 
now an heart truly good in any measure 
doth argue a true and well-rooted faith 
for that onely can purifie the heart 
3 
in this that we know they are pleasing unto our god 
not that they can endure the triall of his justice in themselves 
but because faith in christ doth cover their imperfections 
and therefore are justly accepted through grace 
when the defect is covered

q what are the evidences or tokens of true righteousness
a

the heart of the righteous is a rich treasure or store-house

are a people in whose heart is the law

the course and current of
their heart is to godliness and goodness

how is this righteousness to be strengthened and preserved
a 
we shall strongly hold this righteousness 
if we exercise these things 
1 
labour to give obedience of faith in the least things 
for there must be preciseness in keeping gods commandements 
and we must count nothing little that he commandethprov 
72 
solomon will have us keep his precepts as the sight or apple of the eye 
the eye is a most noble member 
both in use and price 
most tender and diligently to be kept 
but the black or sight 
which is the light or eye of the eye 
by whose force and vertue the whole body is directed 
is the most excellent part of the eye 
most tender 
and to be heeded with double diligence 
hence when the lord would significantly declare what favour and love he beareth to his children 
he saith 
he that toucheth you 
toucheth the apple of mine eyezech 28 
deut 
3210 
psal 
178 
so david prayeth 
keep me as the apple of the eye 
that is 
with that care wherewith men use to keep the black of their eye 
which is most respective and heedfull 
wherefore solomon advising to observe the commandements as the sight of the eye 
doth intimate 
that nothing 
no not the least is to be admitted 
which is contrary to the law of god 
for there is nothing so light or small 
which doth not hurt or offend the sight 
moreover 
many little sinnes are equivalent to one great 
a ship may be laden with small sands 
and many drops of rain will cause great brooks to rise 
yea 
a small sinne fostered and cherished with indulgence 
is more dangerous then a notorious offence 
into which a man slippeth once through infirmity 
it doth secretly poison the soul 
harden the heart 
grieve the spirit 
and wound conscience 
nor is this all 
but little sinnes lived in will make way to greater 
men grow from stealing pinnes to points 
from points to pounds 
sinnes are sociable 
and linked in confederacie 
the lesser creep in at window 
to open the door that greater may enter 
and every sinne of it self being harboured in the soil of corrupt nature 
is thriving 
if let alone it will mainly increase 
2 
we must renew daily a sorrow for our ordinary and smaller offences 
for though it be the weakness of the stomack that is able to bear with nothing that is offensive to it 
yet it is a blessed frame of soul 
when it cannot digest the least sinne 
but is ready to turn at it 
3 
we must think what secure and comfortable courses we have 
while we keep this purpose and practise of a good conscience 
and what a bitterness it is 
when we have our consciences accusing for any more grievous swerving 
the best is 
when it cometh home by weep- in cross 
but how wofull is the state of the soul 
till repentance be given 
for as a stomack surcharged 
which hath neither vent upward nor downward 
so is a soul clogged with guilt 
but wanting repentance 
4 
cleave unto christ by a lively faith still more and more 
for he is the fountain of grace 
and the firmer
our faith is in him 
the more do we partake of his holiness for our sanctification
q 
what use may be made hereof
a 
we must learn our duty 
not to runne on at adventure 
but look to our heart and wayes herein 
we are all priests of god 
we must not go without this breast-plate enameled with ʋrim and thummim 
wherefore let us look that our consciences speak with us 
let us renew our purposes every day 
strike sure covenants with god 
take up the blessed exercise of broken hearts 
bewaile our daily wants 
for we should not let a thought which is awry 
no not a dreame which savoureth corruption 
passe without a censure 
job rather sanctified his houshold on suspition and jealousie 
then neglected matters already apparently evil 
2 
this doth rebuke such 
who content themselves with externall righteousness 
or none at all 
some there are that be good church-men 
honest 
righteous 
peaceable 
just dealing men 
but because they lay not a good foundation of faith in jesus christ 
and of repentance from dead works 
because they care not for the spirit and power of godliness 
therefore brown paper shall as well keep out musket shot 
as this will help them 
when the devil shall let fly his murdring bullets 
many have no righteousness at all 
their consciences being able to accuse them 
that they have lived in profaneness 
contempt of gods ordinances 
pride 
wrath 
covetousness 
pleasures 
their purposes have been to walk after their own hearts lusts 
doing that which is good in their own eyes 
instead of sorrow never to be repented of 
they can tell you 
they were at such a place 
where they were frolick 
had entertainment with sports 
passed the time in merriments

it must be willing and chearfull 
no man can be good unwillingly 
though the thing he doth be good and commendable 
god loveth a chearfull giver

i beseech thee saith david the free-will or voluntary offerings of my mouth 
and thou solomon my sonne 
know thou the god of thy fathers 
and serve him with a perfect heart 
and willing minde
q 
what is implied in this willingness
a 
first 
an holy bent of will 
affectionately following and lifting up it self to whatsoever god requires 
thy people are voluntaries 
saith the psalmist 
that is 
they most freely 
willingly and liberally present themselves and their services unto thee 
thus the children of israel were to bring offerings willingly for the matter of the tabernacle 
and david with his princes offered willingly for the matter of the temple 
that is 
with a free heart set to forward the work for the service of god 
so nehemiah prayeth 
o lord 
i beseech thee 
let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant 
and to the prayer of thy servants 
who desire to fear thy name 
that is 
whose will is inclined and firmly set to walk in obedience before thee 
and this seems to be that which elsewhere is called 
the lifting up of the heart in the wayes of god 
and this perpetuall disposition to the practise of godliness is alwayes required 
not ever the practise of this or that particular duty
the laws that enjoyne any actuall duty 
doe bind us ad semper velle 
but not ad semper agere 
we are tied to iterate and resume them when need is 
but not to continue the acts themselves without intermission

if thou call the sabbath a delight 
i delight to doe thy will

for therein do i delight 
and so we read 
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfullness and gladness of heart 
again 
i will freely sacrifice unto thee 
thirdly 
a willing minde will readily embrace all opportunities to put in practise what is commanded 
and set upon it at the first call 
so 
as much as in me is 
i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also 
what wrought this in the apostle 
but care to wait for a fit season that he might come unto them by the will of god 
abraham being commanded to offer isaac in sacrifice 
riseth early to set forward towards the mount whereon he was to slay him 
james and john being called of christ 
straightway left their father 
their nets and ship 
and followed him 
paul standing ready 
not only to be bound 
but also to die for the lord jesus 
would not be perswaded from going to jerusalem 
though he knew that bands and imprisonment did abide him there 
so we read of amasiah the sonne of zichri 
that he willingly offered himself to the lord 
that is 
with a most cheerfull and prompt minde he offered himself to fight the battels of god 
thus if the heart be to obedience 
or be given to the work of obedience 
an opportunity is gladly welcomed 
paul termes it 
readiness to every good work 
for this makes one towards god 
as a true hearted friend is to him whom he intirely affecteth 
an occasion is acceptable 
whereby he may shew him kindness 
this was in the macedonians 
whom in that particular paul commends to the corinthians for imitation 
whenas even in extream poverty there was found in them a richness of liberality 
a willingness even beyond their power

god requires the heart 
and will respect nothing that is done 
what shew soever it makes

if he may be accused like those of whom jeremie complained 
to have no courage for the truth 
a minister in preaching shall have no reward 
unless he do it willingly 
if he do it more by constraint 
then of a ready mind 
the lord doth not regard his course 
in giving 
it is the cheerfull giver whom god loves 
in hearing 
it is the swift hearer whom he takes notice of 
this is the giving a mans self to god2 cor

spoken of by the apostle 
man looks to no more then the outward act 
neither can he 
but god who trieth the heart and reins 
observes with what spirit and affection every thing is done 
and measures the action accordingly 
2 
to be freely 
willingly and cheerfully disposed in the wayes of holy obedience towards god 
is a speciall blessing 
with all earnestness to be desiredpsal

this was the very thing which david craved 
establish me with thy free spirit 
his desire must be a rule to ours 
and his suing for it 
is a sufficient proof that it is excellent 
he knew he could not stand without the lords sustaining 
and assurance to be upheld by god he could not have 
unless he found in himself such a kind of liberall and ingenuous spirit 
for where duties are not done freely 
they can never be performed constantly 
if the will be not set upon the duty taken in hand 
a small thing will unsetle and turn us by 
it is impossible to continue 
if a setled purpose of obeying be wanting in us

it pleaseth the master that his servant is
willing and cheerfull about his business

lumpish and dead-hearted

what are the signs or evidences of willingness
a 
1 
our praying unto god for such a spirit 
out of the sensibleness of our naturall slavery and bondage unto sinne 
when a man is aware of the forwardness of his nature unto evil 
and of the strong bent thereof unto sinne 
and feels that of himself he hath no heart to the things which god commands 
his very stomack 
in a manner 
is against them 
and so accordingly begs earnestly of godpsal 11932 
40 
that he would 
as david saith 
enlarge his heart 
and quicken him in his righteousness 
this is a good evidence 
that at the least god is beginning in him the work of a free and liberall spirit 
for god prepares his people to that good 
which he means to bestow on them 
by stirring up in them a sensibleness of the necessity of it 
and a fervency and desire of truth to enjoy it 
certainly 
a free spirit is 
as it were 
a breeding in a man 
when he begins to be displeased with the proneness of his disposition unto evil 
and is discontented with himself that good duties are such a burden to him 
and so thereupon prayeth god to turn him about quite 
that holy services may be as pleasing unto him 
as by the bent of nature evil isrom 
618 
that he may become 
as paul saith 
the servant of righteousness 
and may be as cheerfull at the command thereof 
as the servants of the centurion were at his appointment 
whose beck they obeyed without delay 
2 
a free spirit is discerned by an easiness to be perswaded to good duties 
to a willing minde there is no need of many arguments 
the making it to appear that the
business is necessary and good 
such as god requires 
approves 
and will be much pleased with 
if it be done according to his will 
is a sufficient motive 
how easily was paul perswaded at antioch 
to deal unto the people present 
the gospel of god 
the rulers of the synagogue sent to him and barnabas 
to request them if they had any word of exhortation to deliver it 
the text saith 
then paul stood up 
&ampcact 
1315 
16

this was an evidence of that which in this business he calleth his good-will 
so farre was he from looking to be pressed with multiplicity of arguments 
or from needing to be wrought upon by importunity 
that he was rather glad of the occasion 
it is an evil sign when there must be so much urging before a man can be brought to an inclination towards that which ought to be done 
a word is enough to a cheerfull spirit 
an horse of mettall is more quickened with the sound of a wand 
than a dull jade with many smitings of the spurres i would not perswade to rashness 
i know it is possible for a man to be overhasty 
and zeal not guided by knowledge may soon out-carry 
let every man be sure first 
that the matter is good and necessary 
and when that is once made plain to a mans conscience in the sight of god 
if yet there be much adoe to work him unto practice 
it is a sign of an illiberall and servile spirit 
it is a dull jade that will go no longer than the spurre is in his side 
3 
a man shall judg of himself in this point 
by his going on in a good way 
even when he is not egged on by ordinary outward provocations 
nay when perhaps 
in stead of them he meets with discouragements 
as for example 
suppose a good duty 
to which a man is not bound by any humane law 
nor urged by any over-ruling authority 
nor pressed by the perswasions of such as have interest in him 
nor invited by the hope of any profits or praise 
or approbation with the world 
nay 
it may be these things are against him herein 
law seems to inhibit 
authority gives no countenance 
friends 
instead of perswading 
labour to withdraw 
there is like to be some prejudice to profit 
there is possibility of being exercised with reproach 
and of losing esteem and reputation amongst men 
here is a time for a free spirit to shew it self 
he that in this case is so in love with the duty 
and so desirous to approve himself unto god 
that he holds on constantly 
having no egging on 
but variety of withdrawments 
him will i terme a free spirited man

their thoughts and cogitations doe resemble the temper of the heart 
as streams do the quality of the fountain whence they spring 
and not only so 
but they have the same will and affections to godliness

and grow more and more 
it is an easie matter to counterfeit the free person for a time 
many also think they have quit themselves well 
when they have gone a little way 
specially if they suffer any disgrace for weldoing 
but they grow fainthearted by and by 
and change their mindes 
whereas on the contrary true willingness is not an hours bird

but growes on to perfection 
those that are indued therewith 
persevere therein constantly

a 
the regenerate have a freedome to do that which is acceptable unto god 
but they must never forget that they obtained not this freedome by their own merits 
but by the benefit of god 
for he fashioned them anew 
and instead of stony hearts 
hath put into them an heart of flesh
q 
is this liberty or willingness of the saints perfect in this life
a 
by the power of the holy ghost the corruption of the will and affections is broken and made feeble 
that it is not able to hinder the making of a right choice 
but it is not quite taken away 
and forasmuch as this lust 
so long as we live here 
cannot utterly be consumed 
therefore it comes to passe 
that this
liberty which is given unto the godly 
to do things which may please god 
is not perfect and absole 
but weak and maimed
q 
by what meanes is this willingness to be preserved and upholden
a 
first 
labour to humble and shame thy self for dullness and sloth in the service of god 
considering thy former readiness to serve sinne and satan 
o my soul 
why art thou so backward to doe what thy god and saviour doth rerequire of thee 
why seems his work tedious and irksome 
thou hast not served sinne 
nor obeyed the lusts of the flesh in this manner 
thou hast drunken in the puddle waters of iniquity with great pleasure and delight 
thou hast willingly followed the inticements of satan 
to do wickedly hath liked thee well 
what love hast thou borne to pastime 
pleasure 
the vanities of this life 
what time hast thou wasted about them 
what contentment hast thou taken in them 
how earnest hast thou been in pursuit of them 
what 
is the slavery of sinne better then the liberty of grace 
hadst thou rather be the droyl of satan 
then the free-man of jesus christ 
it is enough and too much that heretofore thou hast lived to the lusts of the flesh 
and to have wrought evil in the sight of god 
for the time that remaines give thy selfe to the will of god 
and that with so much the more willingness 
by how much thou hast turned aside after folly 
secondly 
consider what great things the lord hath done for thee 
and how he hath magnified his mercy towards thee1 sam 
1224 
kindness enflames love 
and provokes to willing submission 
how hath the lord respected thee above all thou couldst desire 
or art able to comprehend 
he formed thee in the wombe 
hath fed 
cloathed 
defended thee ever since thou wast born 
he gave his sonne to die for thy redemption 
and in him is pleased to take thee for his adopted sonne 
seeing god hath thus honoured thee with his favours above all thou canst conceive 
shouldst not thou be carefull to honour him with thy willing obedience 
what good thou enjoyest is all of his free grace 
and what is more equall 
then that thou imploy thy strength 
thoughts 
and all the power thou art enriched withallmat

to his glory 
thirdly 
the yoke of christ is easie 
his commandements are not grievous 
in the word nothing is commanded 
but what is pleasant and delightsome 
the service which god requireth is liberall 
not slavish 
did we truly bethinke our selves what is matter of delight 
we should finde greater joy in nothing then in obedience 
again 
faith worketh by love 
which maketh heavy things to seeme light and sweet 
feare causeth the most easie burden to feel grievous and unsupportable 
but nothing is hard to a willing minde 
furthermore 
when we set upon the performance of any holy duty 
the lord is present to assist and strengthen us by his blessed spirit in the doing of it2 thes 
35 
1 thes 
313 
the lord will direct our hearts into the love of god 
that labour which is tedious to the weak and sickly 
is no way grievous to the strong and lusty 
the work of god is a weariness to the unregenerate 
that are led by their lusts 
but to the regenerate 
in whose heart the law is engraven 
who is continually supported and guided by the spirit 
it is meate and drink to finish the work whereunto he is called 
true it is 
the faithfull shall feel the flesh rebelling against the spirit 
but by the power of faith in christ they shall overcome the world 
and be more then conquerours 
lastly 
the comfort of well-doing is so great 
as may animate and encourage therein 
for he that exerciseth himself in the law of god 
hath the witness of a good conscience to plead for him against all accusations 
to cheere him in all conditions 
fourthly 
remember thou art in gods presence 
his eye is upon all thy waies 
ps 
119167 
168 
my soul 
saith david 
hath kept thy testimonies 
and i love them exceedingly 
one reason he gives thereof 
for all my waies are before thee 
thus he exhorteth solomon his sonne to serve the god of his father with a willing minde 
for the lord trieth the heart and reines 
with what readiness will men doe offices of kindness to their neighbours 
whilest present in their sight 
whatsoever
they think or speak of it behind their backes 
thou canst not goe heavily 
uncheerfully about the works of god 
but he doth espie it 
with this meditation quicken thy self 
to do what thou dost with all thy power 
fifthly 
call to minde the rich and ample promises that god who is true and faithfull 
hath made unto them that walke before him with all their hearts 
eye hath not seene 
eare hath not heard 
it is not possible for the heart to conceive what god hath prepared for them that love him 
who would not runne speedily and with good courage to winne such an excellent prize 
sixthly 
earnest prayer is the preserver of willingness 
for after we are effectually drawn and changed by the spirit of grace 
we still need a second and third 
yea perpetuall favour from god 
that even to the last gaspe 
at all times 
in every moment the faithfull soul should cry 
draw me 
they that seeme most obedient are so refractary 
and the swiftest are so sluggish 
that if god doe not continually hale them forward 
they will sit still or goe backward
q 
do not the godly finde much dulnesse and backwardness in themselves
a 
they finde much untowardnesse in themselves at all times 
for the corruption which they carry about with them is a continuall clogge that presseth down 
that they cannot runne speedily the race that is set before them 
but at some times thy feele more unwillingness and inability to do good then at another 
for the lord to let us see what we are in our selves 
doth sometimes leave us to our selves 
and withdraw the effectuall operation of his spirit 
and then we 
as things that can move no longer then they are moved of another 
do presently grow stiffe 
or fall away 
for remedy of this heartlesness we must consider the causes of it 
for in the most it proceeds from security 
earthlymindedness 
conceit of selfe-sufficiency 
delight in sinne 
slight performance of holy duties 
a course in lesser sinne 
or some fall into grosser evill 
and then it must be amended by serious humiliation 
hearty repentance 
and fervent prayerpsal 
5112 
as the prophet perceiving that sinne had gotten a great power upon him 
and that his affections were so secretly ensnared with it 
that he had no such pleasure 
he took no such felicity in the performance of holy services 
as he was wont 
they were irksome and burdensome unto him 
he went on in a kinde of dull 
and heavy 
and unlusty manner with them 
as one weary of this untoward and sluggish disposition which he had cast himselfe into by grievous forgetfulness 
he bewayleth his offence with much bitterness 
and prayeth for a more free kinde of mettall to be wrought into him 
that he might finde himself cheerfull 
and glad 
and of a lively spirit 
in the doing of the things which god commands 
but in some it springeth from excessive sorrow 
abjectnesse of minde 
deep fears 
length of temptation that hath wasted the spirits 
in these it is remedied by a due consideration of gods free love and mercy towards them 
and holy courage and resolution to waite upon his gracious promises 
limmes benummed with cold are quickened with heate 
a dejected spirit is cheered with good words 
if sorrow oppresse 
courage and joy will revive and strengthen

purity and cleanness

god himselfe sheweth what he requires in this behalf 
separate your selves from the uncleane thing 
and i will receive you 
1 cor 
617
q what is implied in this purity and cleanness
a 
pure signifieth as much as fine 
neat 
and unspotted 
and doth properly agree to clear water or glass 
to gold 
silver 
and other pure mettals 
or vessels made of the same 
it agrees also to precious stones which are transparent 
or to polished marble 
and it is applied to men and women who live honestly without blame 
and keep themselves unspotted of the world 
thus it is said in the song of solomon 
cant 69 
my dove 
my undefiled is but one 
she is the onely one of her mother

and a new spirit 
ezek

true it is 
that there remaines corruption in the best that dwell in these houses of clay 
but it is subdued 
it is not delighted in 
it is not cherished 
it doth not prevaile 
the soul and spirit is sanctified by grace 
though but in part 
and this is most necessary 
for the heart of man is the fountain of all his actions 
thereout cometh life

all working derives its beginning thence 
now in reason the fountain must be sweet 
before the waters can be wholesome 
the tree good 
before the fruit savoury 
there must be first a renewed heart 
before there can be a reformed lifepsal 
7312 
secondly 
it implies a conversation or course of life unspotted 
unblameable 
or without offence 
who shall ascend into the hill of the lordjam

and who be they which are the israel of god 
even the pure in heart

who shall ascend into the mountaine of the lord

who shall be a true member of gods church on earth 
and remaine and dwell for ever with him in heaven 
he makes answer 
even he that hath innocent hands

the scope of the place is to shew what is the study and endeavour of all the true adopted sonnes of god

what are the meanes by which purity is wrought
a 
the spirit of god is the immediate authour of this spirituall cleansing 
by whose powerfull operation the word is made effectuall to this purpose 
so paul 
you were thus and thus polluted 
whith those abhominable and filthy sinnes 
but now ye are washed 
and sanctified in the name of the lord jesus 
and by the spirit of our god 
1 cor 
611 
this spirit working with the word 
and by the wordact 
15 9 
begets faith 
and faith hath a speciall gift to purify the heart 
but the spirit worketh by meanes 
and the principall of them is the word of truth 
joh

197 
8 
as being without mixture of any the least falshood or corruption 
but in regard of the efficacy thereof 
it makes cleane 
it causeth to be pure 
the word is the instrument of sanctification 
but afflictions through the blessing of god are made occasions of holiness to the elect people of god 
what the fire is to dross 
that are afflictions to the bad humours which breed about the heart 
and many of them of understanding shall fall 
to try them 
and to purge 
and to make them white

so must he seek it in the conscionable use of those meanes which god hath appointed 
as by earnest prayer 
diligent attendance upon the ministery of the word 
serious meditation 
sorrow for sinne 
and the practice of good works

and the faithfull do finde and acknowledge themselves to be miserable and wretched sinners
a 
that place of job denieth not purity to the angels simply 
but only comparing theirs with gods 
it is as a little streame 
yea 
a drop to the ocean 
which is nothing in comparison 
and for the saints of god 
as long as they live in this world 
they are able to discover more dross then gold in themselves 
and therefore do freely confess themselves to be most vile 
and worthy to be abhorred 
nevertheless 
the lord is pleased to call and esteeme them pure 
not of the greater 
but of the better part 
not by that legal purity which is perfect in all degrees 
but that sound and true 
called evangelicall 
purity which bringeth all the parts forward towards those degrees 
nay more 
christ himself calleth his love all fair 
and saith 
there is no spot in her 
yea 
as pure as the sunne 
as fair as the moon 
cant 
69 
now if any think it unreasonable to ascribe both purity and impurity to the same soul 
he may answer himself by the words of our saviour to his disciples 
joh 
1310 ye are all clean but judas 
when in the same place he sheweth they had need to have their feet washed 
now the servants of god are said to be pure 
first 
because the spirit of regeneration hath washed every part 
although in part onely 
and the conversation of the godly is clean 
though not in that degree it ought 
secondly 
the lord doth graciously remit the sinnes of every believer 
which they do heartily lament 
and in christ accounts them pure 
not imputing the least spot unto them 
thirdly 
the purity begun in them shall be made perfect and absolute 
as though they had never been defiled 
and in respect of what is begun they are said to be without spot 
the scripture speaking of what is in doing as if it were already perfected 
so the body of sinne is said to be crucified with christrom 
66 
that sinne might be destroyed 
and believers to be dead unto sinne 
when sinne hath onely received his deadly wound
q 
is not this sufficient to give occasion to wicked men to brand sincere christians with the odious name of puritans 
or to indite them of blasphemy or schisme at least 
as having opinion of their own purity
a 
christians are pure 
but not puritans 
they affect 
they deserve no such
reproachfull name to be fastened upon them 
they are and ought to be pure 
else would they not be the people of christ 
members of his body 
for he doth sanctifie and purge his church with the washing of water by the word 
eph 526 
he purifieth unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works 
tit 
214 
but this their purity is neither their own 
nor so in their own account 
but onely in regard of gods washing of their robes in the blood of the lamb 
and of his gracious acceptance of them so washed as pure and clean 
all sound christians do from the heart detest and abhorre the hatefull schisme of the catharists 
in english puritans 
but since it is grown to be a nick-name 
in scorne and contempt cast upon them 
that desire to approve their waies unto god 
i will briefly shew three things concerning this matter 
first 
who the old catharists or puritans were 
and what they held 
secondly 
upon whom that scornefull name was cast afterwards 
thirdly 
who be the true puritans 
the successors of those vile hereticks 
the first ring-leader or broacher of that heresie 
was novatus an african by birth 
the presbyter under cyprian at carthage 
who flying out of africk was created presbyter under cornelius bishop of rome in the daies of decius the emperour 
this man aspiring to the bishoprick of carthage and rome 
and missing of his hope 
began to sow dissentions and troubles 
and to spread his pestilent opinions first in africk and then in rome 
for whereas cyprian and cornelius held 
that such as had fallen from the faith in the times of persecution 
partly through fear of cruell torments 
partly through the perswasive allurements of the tormentors 
but chiefly through their own weakness and infirmity 
were upon true repentance to be received into the bosome and communion of the church 
novatus wickedly opposed themeus

and defended that such had commited a sinne unto death 
and therefore should not again be received 
but for ever wholly debarred from re-entry into the church 
after strife between them 
novatus at length made a schisme 
and seperated himself from the church 
and through obstinacy fell into heresie 
novatianus a romane 
and the scholar of novatus 
joyned himself unto his master 
whose deadly poyson he sought to disperse farre and wide this schisme thus made 
about the year of christ two hundred fifty foure

both by drawing honour upon himself 
as also by drawing followers after him 
for whereas first he had protested with fearfull oathes that he never desired a bishoprick 
yet by crafty and forged traines he inticed three bishops out of a corner of italy 
plaine and simple men 
as the history reporteth 
to come unto him 
who being enclosed with leud persons 
and themselves somewhat tipsy 
were constrained to lay their hands on him 
and make him bishop 
and least his sect should be destitute of episcopall authority 
he with three others bishops 
privily ordained novatianus bishop in italy 
and nicostratus 
one of his part and faction 
bishop in africa 
he used also a most impious prank 
to draw the common people to him 
for when he was to administer the sacrament of the lords supper to them 
before he would deliver it into their handseusebius in greek calleth it bread 
which christophorson in his translation leaveth out

he would make them swear that they would not forsake him 
to joyne to cornelius 
by these sleights 
the corruption of mans nature being apt to catch up errour 
he did enlarge his heresie 
and that the rather 
because it consented with the orthodox truth in many articles of faith and profession 
especially of the trinity 
therefore the novatians suffered persecution of the arians and macedonians 
as they in like manner having made agreement with the orthodox 
did banish the arians 
if at any time they could 
and in common persecution raised against the orthodox and novatians 
both by the followers of arius 
such good will and kindness grew betwixt them 
that a league 
reconciliation and agreement had been made 
if the envy of some few 
or rather the providence of god had not hindred
least they being received into the bosome of the church 
should weaken the truth of sound doctrine with their opinions 
this poyson of novatus 
as was said 
spread farre and near through the christian world 
insomuch as divers bishops were infected therewith

nor were these onely tainted with the schisme of novatus and his unwholesome doctrine 
but of the common people farre more 
for in rome it self they flourished till the daies of celestine and long after

others call them patrini or patarini 
as it appeares in the councell of lateran

and the decretals out of it 
this schisme occasioned by the receiving of them that had fallen to idolatry in the times of persecution 
into the bosome of the church upon their repentance 
stayed not there 
but the followers of it falling from one thing to another 
as they which begin to fall from the truth 
fall amaine 
ranne into divers detestable opinions 
first they held a state of perfection in this life 
and that the life of a just man is to be made up without sinne 
spot or wrinkle 
or else that the church could not be made up of them 
and boasted of themselves that they were pure and gloried in their merits

whereas they were free from all such opinions and monstrous conceits 
these things being maliciously devised against them 
to bring them into hatred and contempt 
in like manner the sound professours of true and evangelicall doctrine 
are spitefully traduced as puritans 
by the friends of antichrist and shavlings of rome 
and amongst our selves such ministers and other christian men and women as have embraced the gospel 
and endeavour to follow the same 
with all their souls 
and in simplicity and humbleness of minde have been desirous to draw near unto god 
are very uncharitably and unjustly called by that odious and hereticall name of puritan 
the cause 
originall and order 
whereby these reproachfull termes were given to godly men amongst us 
was this 
when in the reign of queen elizabeth of happy memory 
the gospel was published 
and preachers ordained to teach the people 
many people within a while feeling some taste of the heavenly comfort 
began to delight in hearing sermons 
singing psalmes 
reading scriptures 
and godly books and therewithall did refraine prophane and unprofitable customes 
and sometime they admonished their neighbours 
if they did swear 
and exhorted them to go with them to the sermon 
the greater sort of the people being old barrels which could hold no new liquor 
addicted partly to popery and partly to licentiousness 
having many of them no other god but their belly 
would deride and scoffe at them 
and called them holy brethren and holy sisters 
the urging and enforcing of subscription upon the ministers to the three severall ariticles 
and of conformity to certaine rites and ceremonies 
caused no small division and trouble in the church 
the one side suing for reformation 
and to be eased of such burdens 
and the other urging very straightly the former things 
as punishing such as would not be conformable 
this caused a cloud of writing 
and mens affections waxing hot and drawing to the worse 
it was a very common name to all these ministers to be called puritans 
at this time in the universities you might see a plaine division 
one sort called youths 
and the other sort which took not such liberty 
were called precisians 
and thus it is grown both in the university and in the countrey 
town and city 
that who so feareth an oath 
or is an ordinary resorter to sermons 
earnest against excess

popery 
or any disordersander

he is called a puritan 
this odious name was first brought up by the papists 
of purpose to make our religion odious 
as if it were dissolved and divided into 
i know not what sects and schismes 
but now it serveth for a colour in every papists and atheists mouth to raile at religion and honesty underneath the name of puritanisme 
but how unjustly and uncharitably such as fear god are branded with this nick-name 
is evident to the conscience of every man that will understand 
for they did never arrogate any such thing to themselves 
as to be thought purer then other men 
but alwaies they have acknowledged themselves to be great and grievous sinners 
as well as other men 
accounting their own righteousness to be as a stained cloth 
and rejoycing of no other pureness 
but that which is by the blood of christ 
when for his sake our sinnes are forgiven 
and through faith in him our souls are purified
q 
the seekers of reformation hold that the church may be perfect in this life 
which was the error of the catharists
a 
they never held any absolute and compleat perfection in respect of internall vertue or holiness of works proceeding from it 
which was the error of the pelagians and catharists 
but that the church might be perfect for the outward constitution of discipline in points essentiall 
it cannot be unknown but in moses and the apostles times 
there was a persect patterne of outward government of the churches 
both given of the lord and received of the churches 
neither can there any part of the outward government of the church be assigned 
which draweth any impossibility with it 
if it be said 
that there were faults committed against those perfect patterns 
that is not to the purpose 
for the faults of particular
persons do no more overthrow the perfection of the government 
which was required 
then the faults of the officers in our church against the laws thereof 
are to be imputed to the laws themselves whereby the government standeth 
as for the examples of the churches of galatia and corinth 
that disorder which the apostle chargeth them with 
being sliding back and falling away from that estate wherein they were first of all set by the apostle 
argueth that there was a time 
when the contrary of those disorders had place in those churches
q 
who then are the proper successours of the novatians or catharists
a 
thieves that have stripped true men by the high-way 
to make the more clean escape 
runne away and cry stop thief 
when they themselves are the men that have done the robbery 
so the papists cry out against us 
that we are hereticks 
schismaticks 
puritans 
and what not 
and all to decline that opprobrious style which they deserve 
and without open wrong cannot be taken from them 
the papist is the right puritan 
their head the pope will be called most holy 
whereas they are most impure and ungodly 
he styles himself the servant of servants 
when he exalteth himself above all that is called god 
the papist is the genuine puritan

and such like 
the catharists condemned second marriages 
herein the papists go beyond them 
altogether denying marriage to their priests first and last 
as that for such reasons as make that state too impure for their priests to live in 
by all this it is manifest 
that the papists are the naturall heires of the catharists

which reproachfully they cast upon others
q 
how unjustly soever that reproachfull name be cast upon them that fear god

first 
in regard of gods account and estimation of such as shall choose such clean paths to walke in

2 cor 
71 
2 
lastly 
we should be provoked to a greater
care of holiness 
seeing the lord hath not been niggardly in affording us meanes above many 
by the which we might be cleansed 
he hath given us his word plentifully 
whereby faith might be wrought in us to the purifying of our hearts 
he hath sent out his chastisments and afflictions in such grievous manner 
as our fathers never saw the like 
by which 
as by rubbing 
and beating 
and wringing 
many might be purified and made white 
dan 
1210 
moreover 
he hath sent out his sonne 
whose blood through the eternall spirit offered without spot by himself unto god 
purgeth our consciences from dead works to serve the living god 
heb 
914 
he hath shed abroad his spirit plentifully to renew us 
by whose blessed dewes we might be sprinkled as with pure water
q what are the evidences of this purity
a 
1 
a sincere and hearty desire of inward cleanness 
both to have it 
and to increase in it 
it is a sure rule in religion and divinity 
that the desire of any grace 
is a pledge of the beginnings thereof 
because god workes that in us 
which he will bestow upon us 
by moving our hearts and souls to long after it 
and to become earnest suiters unto him for it 
then again 
when a man soundly desires inward cleanness 
and that his soul may be purged from corruption 
it is a token that he feels corruption to be in him 
that he is weary of it 
that he abhorres it 
that it is irkesome to him 
and none of those things can be sound without speciall grace 
no swine takes more delight to wallow in the mire 
then every man naturally doth in the filth of sinne 
therefore nature is changed 
and grace is begun 
when cleanness is heartily loved 
and an encreasing in it is desired unfainedly 
2jam 
127 
a pure christian is carefull to keep himself unspotted of the world 
he walketh in the world as a cleanly neat man doth in a dirty street 
warily and with choosing his steps 
and with gathering up his cloathes 
so he is loth to be stained and blotted with the gross evils of the times 
he considereth his waies 
and maketh straight steps to his feet 
and is still in fear 
and looking up unto god to beg of him to order his goings 
and is curious to avoid even the least spot 
this is an excellent sign 
such an one may now and then be sprinkled 
as the person i spake of 
notwithstanding all his care 
cannot but receive some spot 
either by his own or some others trampling 
or by the rudeness and touch of some not so carefull as himself 
but it grieves him when it so falls out 
and he is ashamed of it 
he will not be at rest 
untill he hath rubbed and wiped it out by repentance

humbleness of minde 
or meekness of spirit may be wanting 
although there be many goodly gifts in man

q 
what things are implied in this humility
a 
first 
spirituall poverty 
wherein out of conscience of our emptiness and inability to guide 
direct 
support 
and set forward our selves in the way of godliness 
we continually seek unto god for comfort 
and strength to proceed therein 
in whom is all fulness and sufficiency 
spiritual poverty is a free and willing acknowledgment of our indebtedness and dependency on gods grace for grace

and confidence in our strength and vertue 
as if by them we were able to do any thing 
humility teaches a man to set a true estimate upon himself 
and rate himself as god rates him 
secondly 
it implies such a disposition 
whereby we are apt to submit our selves to the good will of god 
and to receive and execute his commandement 
for it resignes our reason as not worth obeying 
and our own will as not worth following

1 
an humble heart is apprehensive of gods majesty and his own vileness 
when he is to appeare before the throne of grace 
he layeth aside all conceit of worth 
thus abraham abaseth himself to the dust in his presence

in all things it seeketh the glory of god 
though with its proper disgrace 
ye men of israel 
why marvell ye at this 
or why looke ye so earnestly upon us 
as though by our own power and holiness we had made this man to walke 
act 
312 
pride challengeth all glory to himself 
being grieved that others should be preferred 
but the lowly mind is well contented with any disparagement 
that may redound to the glory of god 
ye your selves beare me witness 
that i said 
i am not of christ 
but that i am sent before
him

true humility teacheth to worship god purely according to his appointment and the direction of his word 
it may carry a shew of humbleness of mind 
it is gross presumption 
for a man of himself to attempt any thing in the matter of gods worship 
it is a thing beyond his reach to prescribe how the most high will be served 
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels 
intruding into those things which he hath not seen 
vainly puft up by his fleshly mind

or but a little 
oh 
it is good master 
a lowly man composeth and fitteth his mind according to the word of god 
which he admitteth as his only counsellor he will attempt nothing without direction from the truth 
in afflictions he quieteth his heart 
and will not fret or murmur against the lord 
nor use unlawfull meanes for his deliverance 
he will not meddle with other mens matters 
but keep himself within the limits of his proper calling 
he will not in confidence of his wisdome or strength 
thrust himself into the practice of things too high for him 
but in humility waite till the lord shall call him forth 
lord my heart is not haughty 
nor mine eyes lofty 
neither do i exercise my self in great matters 
or in things too high for me 
psal 
1311

proud men deride judgement 
and cast off the commandements 
either stubbornly resisting 
or slighty regarding what the lord hath spoken 
but the humble with fear and trembing submit themselves to the universall obedience of gods law

be not proud

the humble are much in supplications 
he that hath no confidence 
findes no conceited fulness in himself 
will seek abroad for supply of his wants 
when we understand that of our selves we can resist no temptation 
endure no cross patiently 
do no good duty 
promise no good success to our labours 
use no mercy well without gods continuall aide 
support and blessing 
how earnest shall we be to seek helpe from on high 
surely he will ply the seate of mercy both early and late 
that feels this spirituall emptiness in himself

but if the heart be humble it will quickly bleed at the remembrance of what hath been or is amisse 
and fall to free and hearty confession

q 
what course should be taken for the obtaining and preservation of this humility
a 
first 
acquaint thy self with the want of this grace 
and the excellent beauty of it 
the benefit it bringeth 
the promises made unto it 
most see not that they are proud 
few how deeply it hath infected them 
many have humility in contempt 
as if it were a disgrace 
not an ornament
there is not one of many hundreds that doth truely possess the comforts of it 
these are the reasons why it lieth contemned 
and is not looked after 
thy height of pride may be discerned 
by inordinate swelling 
boisterous passions that move within thee 
by discontent 
carnall anger 
self-conceitedness 
secret grudgings at the prosperity of others 
and bold attempting of lawfull affaires without asking leave and seeking help of god 
thy scantness in humility 
by dulness in prayer 
remissness in praises 
spirituall fulness 
that takes away appetite after heavenly things 
and makes the exercises of religion unsavoury 
that hinders digestion of the word by hearty meditation 
and causeth a secure going on from day to day as if we needed not greatly the assistance of god 
when the stomack is clogged with meate 
men come to their meales as though they regarded it not 
they feele not the want of it 
so fareth it with the soul when it is surcharged with spirituall fullness 
men come to prayer 
hear the word 
read the scriptures 
but as if their necessity did not require them 
if we try our selves by these things 
we shall easily perceive how farre short we come in this duty of humility 
the excellency of humility is this 
that it is the basis of other vertues1 pet 
56 
the precious garment of a christian 
that doth more adorn him then pearles or precious stones 
as for the comfort of it 
god will dwell with the humble 
they shall walke in sweet communion with him 
he will enrich them with his graces 
and they shall beare much and good fruit 
the lowly are freed from those boisterous lusts 
distracting cares 
and unbridled passions that torment and vex the heart 
more then any crosses or cruell enemies 
who would not stirre up himself to get the possession of a grace so necessary 
so excellent 
so comfortable in every respect 
secondly 
by faith look up to christ 
and walke with him 
who is meek and lowly in heart 
mat 
1129 
&amp 
215 
friends that converse much together 
do much resemble each other in manners 
speeches 
behaviour 
if we walke in the sunne we shall be died with its hue 
if we commune much with christ 
we shall grow like unto him 
earnest and often cogitations imprint the image of the object upon the heart 
christ the sonne of god became poor 
that he might enrich us 
he humbled himself to the death 
that we might be advanced unto glory 
he endured hunger 
reproach 
poverty 
and dispitefull usage contentedly 
his whole life was a life of sorrowes 
yet did he never repine or complain 
look upon his sufferings 
he was falsly accused 
buffeted 
spit upon 
whipped 
condemned and nailed to the cross 
yet he opened not his mouth 
his example is a perfect samplar of humility 
whereunto we should compose our selves 
christ is our captaine 
followers must imitate there guide and leader 
christ suffered for us what our sinnes deserved 
and if he did patiently beare the punishment of our transgressions 
for his sake it becomes us to endure whatsoever it shall please god to lay upon us 
thirdly 
remember thou standest in need of a saviour 
what art thou in thy self 
but the vassall of sathan 
accursed by the sentence of the law 
subject to eternall wrath 
it is of grace through christ that thou art delivered from everlasting confusion 
if a man have held up his hand at the barr 
and been acquitted onely by the favour of the judge 
say we not 
he hath no cause to be proud 
we must condemne our selves before we can be received to mercy 
what cause have we then to be humble 
can we esteeme our selves miserable and wretched 
worthy to be cast into hell 
and yet be self-conceited of our selves 
fourthly 
learne that whatsoever thou art it is of grace 
he hath no reason to be lifted up in himself that lives on the almes-basket 
what hast thou which thou hast not received
and if thou hast received it 
why dost thou boast1 cor 
47 
8 
faith excludes boasting in the matter of justification 
because it receiveth remission of free grace 
and by the same reason 
he cannot be proud of any grace 
giftrom 
3 
2728 advancement 
that doth acknowledge it to be given of meer and undeserved favour 
humility comes by the knowledge of our selves what we are 
and what we ought to be 
most men have learned to speak the language of canaan 
and to profess that whatsoever good thing he possesseth is given of free mercy without any merit 
but if the heart be puffed up with health 
strength 
skill 
honour 
wisedome 
or conceit of holiness 
it is really infected with that leaven of popery that it is bestowed of merit or worthiness 
fifthly 
call to remembrance the admirable royalties and prerogatives that god of his rich mercy hath vouchsafed unto thee 
the prophet was abased in himself at the consideration of gods bounty to man in the state of innocency 
in that he made him ruler over all earthly creatures 
but god hath raised us from the depth of misery to the top of dignity 
as our sinne abounded 
his mercy hath superabounded 
who is not astonished at this mercy of god 
that he should give us his sonne 
pardon our sinnes 
adopt us to be his sonnes 
and intitle us to that inheritance reserved for his saints in light 
lord 
what is man that thou dost so regard him 
or the sonne of man that thou visitest him 
i am abased at the very thought of thy love that passeth all knowledge 
and the rich effects thereof that cannot be comprehended 
i will never glory in my self 
nor lift up my heart against thee 
for i am less then the least of thy mercies 
sixthly 
acquaint thy self with the lord1 pet 
56 
and consider his incompresible greatness 
ignorance of god 
joyned with measuring of our selves by our selves 
or others 
is the breeder and nurse of loftiness and pride 
for we never come to know our selves 
what we are 
how vile 
feeble and wretched 
till we know the lordisa

the world in comparison of him is as the small dust of the balance 
the angels are not pure in his sight 
much less any of them that dwell in houses of clay 
whose foundation is the dust 
which are crushed before the moth 
the more we look up to him 
the lower shall we be abased in our selves 
as having nothing wherein we should be compared

after they be once planted in us 
dilligence is the daughter of prudence

dilligence hath respect to every good work 
if a master give many things in charge to his servant 
he thinks it not well that one be done and the rest neglected

what reasons may shew the necessity of this dilligence and constancy
a 
1 
no duty is well performed without them 
cursed is he that doth the work of the lord negligently 
2 
christianity is a trade 
wherein men go from one work to another 
and use great dilligence if they look to thrive 
nay 
the work of a christian is great 
and of divers sorts 
that he hath no time to be careless or remiss without extream loss and hinderance 
he hath many sinnes to weed out 
and labour against 
and therefore is not heedlesly to marre all his work in an houre 
that he hath well followed sundry daies 
he hath also many duties to look unto 
towards god 
his neighbour 
and himselfe 
wherein it shall be found requisite for him to be carefull 
after the doing of one 
to go to another 
and not to admit any thing against the peace of his conscience 
no not in his recreations 
nor in his weightiest worldly dealings 
feastings 
company 
&ampc
but to see the ʋnity of the spirit kept in the band of peace 
3 
by nature we are dull and backward to whatsoever is good 
apt and forward to all kinde of evil 
therefore if we would have grace to get up and grow 
we must strive with utmost endeavour 
be not slothfull 
but strive through faith and patience to inherit the promises

q 
what are the benefits of dilligence and constancy
a 
this dilligence and constancy 
in whatsoever they be used 
they bring great things to pass 
whether it be in any trade 
or in the searching out of things obscure and hard to be found out 
even where onely the light of reason is followed 
and who doubteth then 
but that in holy duties wherein men are guided by the spirit of god 
most excellent effects are brought forth by them 
first 
hereby we weane our selves 
our hearts and minds from much draffe and worldly lusts 
which would 
if they might finde lodging in the soul 
much annoy us 
and are much more readily disposed unto duty 
then such as will not embrace them 
who being contented with any uncertain and deceiveable perswasion of gods favour 
and refusing to be holden within such narrow bounds and straights of this holy and christian counsell 
break out oftentimes to their trouble 
danger 
and discredit 
when the other are quiet and merry 
labour is irkesome to such as runne after pleasure 
easie to them that follow it with constancy 
secondly 
the hand of the dilligent makes rich 
and the soul of the industrious shall be satisfied with the fruit of his labours 
surely he that goeth forward by dilligence and constancy in the course of piety 
he shall grow plentifully in grace 
and be replenished with abundant consolation 
the success of worldly travels are subject to casualty and hazard

i have finished my course 
and kept the faith 
from henceforth is laid no for me the crown of righteousness 
which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day 
and not to me onely 
but to all that love his appearing
q 
what is the danger of sloth and inconstancy
a 
they that do not dilligently and constantly buckle themselves to one good work or another 
shall never finde that sweet fruit of their lives which otherwise they might and should 
but by their negligence and inconstancy shall by little and little plunge themselves into such deep unsetledness 
out of which it will not be easie for them to recover 
joynts often removed out of their places 
are seldome setled 
ever painefull 
to them that love liberty to the flesh 
the yoke of christ is very tedious 
as constant labour is to him that delighteth in roving or ranging up and down 
besides 
he seldome thrives that shifteth to many trades 
stickes to none 
that travelleth many countries 
planteth not himself in any 
an inconstant and fickle christian never groweth to any pitch or substance in grace 
but doth ever remaine bare and needy 
the sluggard 
and so the inconstant shifter 
shall be clothed with rags 
lastly 
as gamesters pay dear for their pastimes many times 
so doth the negligent christian for his stolen liberty 
he that in feeding respecteth more the delight of his palate 
then the continuance of his health 
must look to feele the knawings 
gripes and pangs of sickness 
so fareth it with them 
that to satisfie their lusts 
neglect the peace of a good conscience 
the pleasure of carnall liberty is recompensed with loss of inward peace 
which is not easily regained in a long time
q what course must be taken to remedy sloth and inconstancy
a 
first 
we must finde our selves guilty 
the traveller will not return 
till he see himself out of the way 
amendment presupposeth sight of what is amiss 
there needs not much paines to prove us faulty 
if we shall but consider what liberty we have given to our thoughts 
how indulgent we have been to our lusts 
what opportunities we have omitted 
how we have fallen from our good purposes 
how dull we are to good 
superficiall to holy dutyes 
and vaine in our speeches 
what daies have we wasted in idleness 
how oft do we let loose our hearts to range up and down in vanities 
after we have spent some part of the morning or afternoon in reading the scripture 
prayer or such like good exercise 
secondly 
the heart must be wrought to shame and sorrow for our idleness and inconstancy 
how can i think of my sloth and fickleness in gods service 
and not be ashamed 
if my servant have loitered his day over 
and not done my work 
he blusheth 
and is afraid to come before me 
and shall i not change countenance 
and be moved 
that i have been so unprofitable in the works of god 
if i neglect opportunities for earthly affairs 
i am disquieted in my self 
and condemne my oversight 
and shall i not grieve 
that i have let pass the gracious seasons of doing good to my soul 
o the unthankfulness whereof i stand guilty before god 
how could i answer it 
if he should call me to account 
or how should i confess it to begge pardon without grief and sorrow 
ah 
poor soul 
what comfort can i take in my vaine thoughts 
foolish delights 
slight performance of good duties 
and carnal case that i so much affected 
it hath robbed my soul of grace 
my heart of comfort 
my life of sweetness 
and nothing is left of all that vanity 
but remorse and shame 
lord i am confounded in my self 
to think of my great reckonings 
and what slender account i can give unto thee 
thirdly 
we must quicken our selves to more dilligence and constancy 
princes require exact dilligence in their followers 
if they send upon a message 
they look it should be done with expedition to the full 
and an answer returned at the time appointed 
how attent 
industrious 
and constant should i be in the service of the great king and lord of hosts 
our affection to god should be most intire 
our bond to him is strongest 
his work is most honourable 
his pay incomparably the greatest 
all which do call for all possible dilligence at our hands 
the pismire gathers in summer 
the covetous seeks wealth early and late 
the ambitious hunteth for honour with all his might 
the naturall man regardeth the things that pertaine to this life naturall
and shall i not follow after the true riches 
honour 
and life 
that exceeds the rest beyond comparison 
with the swiftest speed and motion untill i do possesse it 
to be carefull of things temporall 
careless of things eternall 
what greater madness 
to prevent earthly danger with the hazard of the true treasure 
what more extreme folly 
to please men with dilligence 
and to displease god through remisness 
is to be penny wise and pound foolish 
it is enough and too much that i have negligently husbanded my time and stock of grace 
as though nothing had been sufficient for the world 
every thing too much for heaven 
for the time to come i will set upon a wiser course 
and with all constant assiduity address my selfe to do the will of god in all things 
fourthly 
we must fly to god by hearty prayer 
entreating him to confirme and stablish this purpose in us for evermore 
lord my resolution to walke in thy laws 
is wholly grounded upon thy assistance 
without which i can neither think 
will 
nor do any thing that is truly good and acceptable in thy sight 
give me 
i pray thee 
an heart to keep thy commandements alwaies 
thou art the god of peace 
subdue mine affections that rebell against thy spirit 
and sanctifie me throughout 
that i may wholly yeeld my selfe to thy good pleasure all the daies of my life

&ampc
q 
were all that professed religion in rome or ephesus 
saints by calling
a 
a saint is inwardly a saint 
or by outward profession 
now paul was not ignorant 
that there were bad fish as well as good 
chaffe as well as wheate in this visible church 
nevertheless he doth well call them saints 
first 
because they were all so by outward professon of doctrine and participation of the sacraments 
yea 
by temporary faith and conformity 
for ought we know 
for 
look how a civill vertuous man doth not like to have in his house uncivill rake-shames 
so the most holy god will not allow any in his family 
openly unholy 
like master 
like man 
at least in outward conformity 
secondly 
there were many saints in corinth 
and the better part 
not the bigger giveth the denomination 
wine and water is called wine 
gold and silver oare unfined 
is called gold and silver 
though yet must dross be intermedled with it
q 
is this title of saints given onely to them that believe in christ 
either in truth or profession
a 
god is often called in scripture the saint 
or holy one of israel 
and the king of the saints 
holiness is ascribed unto god in the wordhos

first 
because he in himself is sanctity and purity it self 
and it is impossible that in him should be any evil 
sinne 
or uncleanness 
he is light 
and darkness in him there is not any 
secondly 
because he is the only author and effecter of all holiness and sanctimony in whomsoever 
sanctifying us his people 
and advancing us hereby above all nations which he hath made 
this being one of his principall blessings 
so that none is holy as the lord 
he is a holy god sanctified in justice 
and let all flesh bless the name of his holiness for ever and ever 
he is called the holy one of israel 
because in speciall manner he made himself known unto them 
whom he separated from all nations of the earth 
to be a peculiar people to himself 
who were to beare his name and do him service 
and to whom he shewed himself most bountifull 
in speciall manner 
prosecuting them daily with his favours 
jesus christ 
as he is god manifested in the flesh 
is the saint of god 
the holy one 
and the true 
even the holy one of israel 
being himself full of the holy ghost 
wherewith he baptiseth his church whereof he is the mediatour 
the high priest in the law 
as a type of christ 
is called the saint of the lord 
the elect and blessed angels are also saints 
having sanctity by creation continued and confirmed unto them for ever 
all men and women called to the faith of god 
are saints by calling and separation from the world 
being sanctifyed by christ jesus 
and one with another are holy brethren 
of these 
some are saints departed this life 
and sleeping in the lord 
other some are on earth 
and whiles they here live 
nowithstanding their many infirmities and afflictions 
are saints of the most high 
a holy nation

secondly 
faith begetteth profession of holiness2 cor

the leaves and fruit should likewise be changed 
as if a peare-tree should be made an apple-tree 
it would have leaves and fruits agreeing to the change made in it 
so man by faith having his heart purified 
made a tree of righteousness 
he hath his leaves and fruit 
leaves of profession 
fruit of action 
so again 
man as a new tree set into and growing out of christ 
beareth a new fruit 
he converseth in holiness and newness of life

none can take them out of his hand

and his daies on earth must have an end

when daniel had described the greatness and glory of the princes

at last he comes to speak of a kingdom

what signes or evidences are laid down in scripture 
by which the saints may be discerned

the saints are humbled at the feet of the most high

which they receive and possesse as a thing of worth and excellencypsal 
119111 
thy testimonies have i taken as an heritage for ever 
for they are the joy of my heart 
2 
they stand in awe of god continually 
fear the lord ye his saintspsal

for there is no want to them that fear him 
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saintspsal

the lord is the portion of his saints 
though they have hopes or possession of great things in the earthpsal 
165 
jer 
5119 
yet gods favour is that they most prize 
and spirituall things are to them the fairest part of their inheritance 
4 
in extream afflictions the saints faint not 
cease not to seek unto god by hearty prayer 
runne not unto wicked and ungodly meanes to help themselves 
but patiently commit themselves unto him in wel-doing 
and hope in mercy 
5 
the faith of the saints is confirmed by afflictions 
and the experience of gods dealing towards them 
therefore they be not dismaied 
though they meet with manifold trials 
but follow after the lord with more dilligence 
stk faster unto him 
and cleave unto his testimonies 
6 
it is the constant study of the saints to keep themselves from the pollutions and defilements of the world 
as they be a people separated from the world to the service of god 
7 
the saints of god do heartily love and affect each other 
be they in outward estates never so different 
true christian sanctity 
next to god and our own souls 
makes us affect those that are sanctified 
who express in their life the vertues of our heavenly father 
by whom we are called from darkness to light 
hence it is that the saints 
the houshold of faith 
the brethren 
are commended as persons whom we must affect and do good to before all other 
thus david loved 
all my delight is in the saints 
thus paul 
we love none according to the flesh 
every creature loveth and liketh to be with those who are united with it in the communication of the same nature 
so sanctified christians cannot but love and like to be most with them 
who have received the like divine nature 
in which themselves are partakerseph 
115 
col 
14 
yea 
thy love all christian saints 
not such who have other parts pleasing and contentfull 
but they love every one in whom they can see the image of god shining 
for it cannot be but that love which truely loveth one person as he is holy 
should love every one 
so farre forth as he is holy 
and from this love issueth willingness to minister to the necessities of the poor brethren 
yet 
though we are to esteeme and inwardly affect men 
as we see them holy 
we are not bound to shew them the outward effects of our love answerably 
the nearer persons are tied to us in naturall and civill bands 
the more must our providence be for them 
and love shewed them in outward things 
unless their foolish lewdness dispriviledge them this way 
for then the proverb taketh place 
a wise servant may be preferred before a foolish childe 
8 
it is the priviledge of the saints that they have part in each others prayers 
and it is their duty and practice to pray for one anothereph 
61 
praying alwaies with all prayer and supplication in the spirit 
and watching thereunto with all perseverance
and supplication for all saints
q 
what use may be made of this point
a 
1 
this lets us see the fearfull estate of many amongst us 
who like as they tell of halifax nuts 
which are all shels 
no kernels 
so these professe themselves saints 
but their ignorance 
their idle courses 
their riots 
their blasphemies 
proclaime that there is nothing within which belongeth to saints 
nay 
many will not stick to professe they are none of the holy brotherhood 
to jest at such as indeavour to holiness 
saying 
that young saints prove old devils 
it is a wonder that such hellish owles dare fly in the sun-shine of so christian a proffession as is made amongst us 
such believers 
who are mockers of saints 
who will not be accounted saint-holy 
and such who are not changed into new creatures 
walking in newness of life 
they may well fear that their belief is not true 
such as doth unite them with christ 
for whosoever is a true believer 
is a saint 
whosoever is by faith in christ 
is a new creature 
2 
hence we see the vanity of the papists 
in tansferring and appropriating this name of saints 
to those whom the pope hath put in his kalendar 
and to whom he hath adjudged divine honours 
holi-daies 
invocation 
candles 
church 
&ampc 
these saints were not heard of in st pauls time 
a man may be in hell 
who hath all such things performed about him 
for the pope doth continually erre in taking that upon him which was never in his power 
viz 
to canonize saints in that manner 
and in the particular object he doth grossly mistake 
setting notorious and publique homicides 
traitours 
murderers of princes 
incendiaries 
and gross ideots in the catalogue of saints 
saints are triumphant or militant 
triumphant 
such who now walk by sight 
enjoying the presence of god 
angels 
spirits of the righteous departed 
who have now rested from all the labours of their militant condition 
militant 
who walk by faith in holy profession and conversation 
holding christ their head 
by whose power apprehended by faith 
they are kept to salvation 
3 
this may strengthen us against temptations from our imperfections 
the lord doth reckon of us 
and hold us as saints 
he that by faith hath put on the sunne of righteousness 
is more clear and bright 
then if he were arrayed with the beames of the sun 
again 
though we have sinnes too many 
yet the better part giveth the name 
corne-fields we see have weeds 
yet we call them corn-fields 
not fields of weeds 
so here 
yea grace 
though it seem over that sinne sheweth to be 
yet it will in time overcome it 
as carloe is much higher then the barly 
yet the barly getteth up and killeth it 
the spirit that is in us from christ 
is stronger then the spirit of the world
q if the name of saints be common to all belivers 
how seemeth it to be appropriated to the apostles and evangelists in the titles of those holy books which they penned
a 
this title or epithet 
though it be both common and ancient 
yet questitionless was not annexed by any of these writers 
as not agreeable to true christian discretion and modesty 
yea perhaps it was also 
if not injurious 
yet likely to prove offensive to all other believers 
that a title common to all and every christian 
should be made proper to some few 
though principall members of the church 
you will object 
it may be 
that these writers stile themselves apostles 
as if they desired to have their dignity and office known to all men 
true it is 
that they do so indeed in their epistles 
but neither did that name belong to all the faithfull 
or to any 
but some certain men 
and it was necessary for the authorizing of their writings 
how then 
do i condemne the title 
or the first authours 
or continuers and users of it 
nothing less 
for i gladly acknowledge both that the apostles and evangelists had especiall interest in that name 
and that there could be no danger of scandall 
seeing it was not taken by themselves 
but given to them as an honour 
by the consent as it were 
and
with the liking of all true christians 
whose purpose it was 
not to make them mediatours of intercession betwixt god and men upon earth 
but to shew the reverent opinion they had conceived and did hold of such worthy and holy menchesed pro dedecore penitur

but we see it often falleth out in the world 
that falshood and deceit have the upper-hand 
when the cause of god goeth to the wall 
and the godly be overcome of their enemies
a 
we must needs confess and acknowledge 
that those are the most profound waies of god 
whose counsels are above our reach 
but if we shall go into the sanctuary of the lord 
there we shall understand the reason of these his wonderfull works 
and be made to know that there is just cause of that his proceeding 
both in respect of the godly 
and the ungodly 
of his people 
and of their enemiesluk 
187 
there we shall learn 
that god is patient and long suffering 
who can indure that his cause and the cause of his people should be hindred for a time 
and that the ungodly domineer 
not that he is mindless of his glory 
and the prosperity of his servants 
but that his honour might be the more advanced 
when once he begins to drive back his enemies 
and to lift up the heads of his children 
which
before were dejected and cast down 
hear what the lord to this end saith by his prophet 
the earth mourneth and languisheth 
lebanon is ashamed and hewen down 
sharon is like a wilderness 
and basan and carmell shake off their fruits 
now will i rise saith the lord 
seeing my people are so much confounded 
and every man thinketh 
they are wholly overthrown now will i be exalted

the enemies of my people 
this is gods purpose when he suffereth his people for a time to be over-run and mastered by their enemies 
which if we consider well 
we will no longer be abashed thereat 
nor stumble at gods works 
though things go never so cross for a time with his people 
when we read of the prosperity of haman that cruell and sworne enemy of gods people 
and understand that he prevailed so farre that all the people of israel were judged to die 
and that he being their greatest and most bitter enemy 
had the execution thereof committed to him 
would not men conclude 
looking upon the outward untoward proceedings 
that the lord had abandoned and forsaken his people israel 
and yet we know in the end 
all the circumstances of that business 
did make much for the comfort of the godly 
and the honour of god 
the insolency of the enemy 
the poor and weak condition of the israelites appointed to destruction 
did turn to the praise of god 
so wonderfull is the lord in his works 
whereby it appeareth 
that even then when he suffereth the cause of his people in a manner to fall unto the ground 
he still holdeth the rudder in his hand 
and hath an eye on them 
and a care that they shall not altogether be overthrown

swear vainly 
defraud or covet

he cannot fall to his old fare 
nor finde sweetness in such unsavory offals 
even so it is with him that hath besotted himself with the deceitfull pleasures of sinne 
and
is bound with the chaines of satan 
if once he come to see the misery of his present estate 
and to have a taste of the liberties and priviledges of a christian life 
he casteth out that former draffe as vomit 
and by no meanes will be brought to take pleasure in it any more 
and without question 
great is the benefit of this change 
greater then all the princes in the world are able to bestow upon us 
for this will not suffer us to hunt after variety of sinfull pleasures 
but rather with moses 
to renounce them 
when we might have our fill of them 
and count it a greater happiness to suffer affliction with the godly 
then to flourish in wealth and honour with the wicked

it is the note of a righteous man 
he will do none iniquity 
indeed it must be granted 
that power to depart from sinne with willingness 
is not obtained without much striving 
and that it will cost many prayers to weaken corruption 
and to hold rebellion under 
with much sighing and sorrowing 
to see what unlikelihoods there are of subduing such unruly passions 
through our manifold weaknesses 
but what then 
is it much 
if so great a work require our watching thereto and dilligence 
when god is pleased that it be bestowed that way 
and without it no common work will go forward 
or is that any just cause of discouragement to us 
to take paines for great profit 
when we are sure of it before we go about it
q 
do gods servants alwaies prevaile in striving against evil 
and obtaine that which they seek thereby
a 
as god often helpeth them 
that they do overcome 
so they are oft overcome themselves of their affections 
against which they strive 
which slips or defects they neither passe over lightly without regard 
nor be dismaied at and dejected above measure 
they are taught 
that they stand by grace 
not by their own goodness 
and live by faith 
not by feeling 
though
that be a comfortable thing 
therefore they cast not away their hope 
though corruption prevaile for a time 
but on the other side they consider 
that their sinne displeaseth god 
which raiseth godly sorrow 
and draweth them to take better view of their own frailty 
ignorance 
and negligence 
and confess the same to god 
and take shame to themselves 
thus the godly are neither careless of their course 
nor dismaied at their foiles 
they cast not away their confidence 
nor give place to security 
but be incouraged to hope for pardon 
and made circumspect to look to their waies with more diligence for the time to come
q 
do gods children then gaine by their falls
a 
through the mercy of god they gaine very much 
for first 
such slips are very necessary to pull down our pride 
and to give us experience of our own frailty 
idleness 
vanity 
as also of gods gracious working in us 
and tender love over us 
which otherwise we should not have had 
secondly 
by this meanes 
that which through ignorance and weakness of faith 
they feared would have separated them from god 
doth fasten them more nearly to him 
and the sorrow which they conceive for a time 
is turned into sound rejoycing 
the malice of satan in this case 
may fitly be compared to the malice of a certain souldier mentioned in stories 
who thrusting his enemy into the body 
with full purpose to have killed him 
did thereby lance the ulcer which no physician was able to cure 
and let out the corruption 
that would have cost him his life

but we must stand prepared and readily disposed to do good as opportunity is offered 
as well the omission of necessary duties 
as the commission of evils and enormities 
may make a man stand guilty of sinne in gods sight 
and bring gods wrath down upon persons and people 
not serving of god 
and not sacrificing is a sinne 
as well as prophane service 
yea 
not sacrificing 
as well as the prophanation of a sacrament or sacrifice 
may bring pestilence upon a people 
he that observeth not the passover in his due time 
or that humbleth not his soul at the solemn time of fast 
that soul shall be cut off from among his people 
it was the not slaying of agag 
that lost saul his crown 
and the not circumcising of moses his first borne 
that had like to have cost moses his life 
and not the robbing onely 
but the not relieving and compassionating of the poor 
was the rich man his ruine 
and shall be sufficient matter to condemn many at the last day 
it is not the omission of evil onely 
but the practice of piety 
charity 
justice and equity that god requireth of thee 
we are taught of god 
to deny ungodliness 
and to live soberly 
we are exhorted 
to forsake sinne 
and to embrace holiness 
to lay aside maliciousness and sinne 
and as new borne babes 
to desire the sincere milke of the word 
when a good man is described 
usually the scripture saith of him 
he escheweth evil 
and feareth the lord 
not onely they that take part with the enemies of god 
but such as come not to helpe the lord against the mighty 
are subject to the curse of meroz 
for there are affirmative as well as negative precepts 
yea 
as every affirmative includeth a negative 
so every negative hath an affirmative infolded in it 
and there is a curse imposed as a penalty 
as well on the breach of the one 
as on the breach of the other 
and the one is as well broken by the omission of that that therein is enjoyned 
as the other by the practice of that that therein is inhibited 
again 
christian men are in the word of god compared unto trees 
and those not such as by nature and kinde are unfruitfull 
and beare no fruit 
or bad fruit 
but such as by nature are fruitfull 
and beare good 
sweet 
ripe fruit 
as vines 
olives 
figgs 
generous or noble vines 
olives planted in a fat soyle 
and such like 
now in such trees 
barrennss or unfruitfulness alone 
is cause sufficient to set them apart for
fewell 
and therefore not the wild vine onely 
that beares sower grapes 
or the empty vine that beares fruit to it self

and the fruitless fig-tree 
and every tree that either beareth not 
or beareth not good fruit 
is adjudged to the fire 
moreover 
christians are the lords husbandry 
which he continually watereth and dresseth with his word and spirit 
of whom he expecteth good fruit meet for him 
by whom they are husbanded 
what man would be at cost and paines to manure 
till and sow barren ground 
that yeelded no increase 
the earth that bringeth not forth good fruit is rejected 
and nigh unto cursing 
barrenness alone is cause sufficient 
why the ground should be cast forth and laid wast of the husband-man 
and better acceptance we cannot expect of god 
if we continue barren and voide of fruit 
to these may be added 
that the faithfull are branches of christ 
the true and living vinejoh

even twelve manner of fruites 
twelve times a year 
lastly 
not to do well is to do evil 
not to relieve is to kill 
not to give is to rob 
this is evident by the speech of our saviour to the scribes and pharisees 
is it lawful to do good on the sabboth daies 
or to do evil 
to save life 
or to killmar 
34 
however men may conceive that he is a good man that doth no evil 
it is most certainly and undoubtedly true on the other side 
that he is an evil man that doth no good 
and he that doth not good 
doth evil 
wherefore let us be exhorted and incited to a diligent practice of those good duties that god requireth of us 
and not content our selves with a bare forbearance of evil 
but to apply our selves to a carefull and conscionable performance of all such religious offices 
as our callings either generall or speciall 
publique or private exact of us

his shield that 
compasseth him about

and that for ever 
thou lord wilt bless the righteous 
with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield 
his truth shall be thy shield and buckler 
happy art thou 
o israel 
who is like unto thee 
o people saved by the lord 
the shield of thy helpe 
my buckler is upon god 
who saveth the upright in heart 
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him

ye that fear the lord 
trust in the lord 
he is their helpe and their shield

for the lord stands betwixt them and all dangers 
till he be pierced 
which is impossible 
they cannot be hurt 
as he is the protection of a good man 
so is he their glory 
not onely the matter of their glorying 
but the maintainer of their credit and reputation 
their dignity and worth 
in god is my salvation and my glory 
for he will honour them that honour him 
and is the lifter up of their heads 
if they be in heaviness he will restore comfort unto them 
if in disgrace 
he will exalt them to honour 
what should the godly fear 
that have such a protector and defender 
against whom no power of man can prevaile 
whose wisdome is unsearchable 
power unressistable

and thus man is to exercise himself in the knowledge of divine truths 
made known for our direction and comfort 
first 
the knowledge of god in christ 
his will 
and works 
is with all care and diligence to be sought after 
acquaint now thy self with him 
and be at peace 
thereby good shall come unto thee 
receive 
i pray thee 
the law from his mouth 
and lay up his words in thy heart 
the works of the lord are great 
sought out of all them that have pleasure therein 
this knowledge is the perfection of the minde 
the ground of confidence 
the beginner of sound comfort and refreshing 
this paul prayeth for in behalf of his colossians 
that they may be filled with the knowledge of god 
the spirits of their minds being opened to look toward him 
even as our imge in the glass doth look toward us 
from whom it is reflected 
so god his image in us doth make the eyes of our minde view him 
the author of it in us 
but men must not curiously prie into needless matters that pertaine not to them 
nor search into that which is not revealed 
secret things belong unto god 
but things revealed to us and to our children 
secondly 
the knowledge of things belonging to our state and vocation is not to be neglected 
for hereby we are fitted the better to glorifie god in our standing 
be thou diligent to know the state of thy flock
q 
what is the end of knowledge
a 
the end of spirituall knowledge is 
first 
communion and fellowship with god in jesus christ 
1 joh 
13 
that which we have seen and heard 
declare we unto you 
that ye also may have fellowship with us 
and truly our fellowship is with the father 
and with his sonne jesus christ 
ignorance doth estrange us from god 
and knowledge doth acquaint us with him 
as the eye becometh one with that which it seeth 
and is after a sort in that light it beholdeth 
so are we by the vision of god 
which is begun in us 
one with him 
and in him 
secondly 
practice and obedience 
is another end of knowledge

for gods scope in giving his law 
was not to make triall of mens wits 
who could sharpliest conceive

but to work according to knowledge 
some sciences 
in comparison of others more operative 
are tearmed speculative 
but there is not one of these 
whose speculation tends and ends not in some operation 
by which man is profited 
and god is honoured 
this is most true of divinity 
the science of sciences 
whereby we are made wise unto salvation 
throughly furnished unto every good work 
the law was given that we might
obey it 
the precepts are best learned 
when most circumspectly practised 
practice promotes the glory of godier 
315

41 
for admirable gifts of science 
learning 
and memory 
men may admire thee 
but they give god thanks only for the good they receive from thee 
the sunne it self if it did not shine and give warmth unto the creatures 
were the glorious hue of it ten times more then it is 
none would half so much bless god for it 
the men for whom our heavenly father is glorifiedmat 
516 
are such 
whose works shine before men 
who warmeth the loynes of the poor 
who commends a school-master 
whose scholars can say and understand their rules 
but speak not 
write not any good stiles by them 
who praiseth a captaine 
whose souldiers can skill of military tearmes and orders 
unless their acts and exploits of warre be suitable 
for such men as joyne practice with knowledge 
god is blessed of them 
and such men shall be blessed of god in their deeds 
as the more knowing 
without doing 
shall procure the more stripes 
because god for them is the more blasphemed 
so the more doing 
with knowing 
shall have double honour 
because god was doubly honoured in them 
some luscious delight there is in studying good books 
ruminating on good notions 
not unlike that which is in tasting and swallowing sweet meates 
but all the benefit is in the strength and nourishment it breedeth after concoction 
when thoughts breed works 
and studies turn into manners 
all discourses of faith and hope 
are but drie things 
in comparison of the acts and practice of them 
which are sweet and delicate above the honey and the honey-combe

726 
27 
and not practitioners 
he that heareth the word and doeth it not is compared by christ to a foolish man 
that built his house upon the sand 
which is easily overturned with every blast of winde 
as the praise 
so the pleasure of vertue consisteth in action 
what profiteth wit or other naturall parts 
if not used aright 
what comfort can the traveller take in his knowledge of the way 
if himself go in the clean contrary path 
the practice and use of all operative arts is all in all

the comfort of practice is great to the doer himself 
the profit much to others 
a speechless life hath more life in it to winne others 
then a liveless speech 
good works are invincible arguments 
the only miracles of these times 
to confirme doctrine 
and make entrance for it into the heart 
an archer puts not more force into an arrow he shoots

arguments are dark if good life put not lustre and light into them 
perswasions are weak 
if holiness make not entrance for them 
words are but wind 
and vanish into the wind

let us therefore affect goodness above cunning 
for that is a good signe 
and a good help and step to be such an one 
especially when this desire breeds prayer for power to do 
knowing that without christ 
we can do just nothing 
and as helps of practice 
first 
acknowledge thine own disability 
or rather deadness to every good work 
and commend thy self to the work of his grace 
for the will and the deed 
intreating him not only to regenerate thee 
and give thee new principles of motion 
but to renew his inspiration upon every new act of thine 
that by christ 
or rather christ in and by thee 
may do all things 
pray 
as if thou hadst no will 
vow 
as if there were no grace 
that is 
seriously both 
secondly 
in the u e of all meanes of practice 
pray and desire thou maist light upon profitable and pertinent matter 
books and sermons 
no meanes ordinarily will do thee good 
unless thou go with a mind to be bettered by them 
thirdly 
in the use of these 
attend to thy self as well as to the matter 
have one eye and ear fixed on what is said 
another on thy self 
lay thy self to the rule 
and say 
what is this to me 
how do i and that agree 
look thy face in the glass 
and take notice what thou art 
what thou oughtest to be 
aske thy heart 
how do i practice this 
how doth this reprove me 
what comfort may i take by such promises 
how am i to make use of these things in my daily business and occasions of life 
when thou art well perswaded to do any thing 
resolve throughly to do it 
and when resolved 
dispatch and execute it speedily 
fourthly 
after the sermon is ended or the chapter read 
meditate upon it till it be made thine own 
after reading or hearing 
do as men do after dinner 
sit a while 
concoct it 
digest it 
and after draw it out into practice 
a doctrine is never well heard 
till it be stamped upon the heart 
and expressed in life 
so do such as learn musick or writing 
they play over their lesson 
write after their copy 
fifthly 
in all thy talke 
discourses and counsels to others 
look first to thy self 
and labour to possess what thou exhortest 
teachest 
commendest to the saints 
that wise man is fool 
that is not wise for himself 
each man is desirous to reap the fruit of his own wisdome or skill 
to counsell another to the good 
that thou regardest not 
is most egregious madness 
sixthly 
take daily accounts of thy self 
as masters of their journey-men and apprentices 
aske of thy conscience 
what good thou hast done 
how thou thrivest in grace 
what proceedings thou hast made 
what thou hast gained by the exercises of religion 
seventhly 
where thou shalt take thy self tardy in any matter 
labour to be affected with it in good earnest 
and humble thy self before god for it heartily 
hearty confession is the way to reformation 
for sinne will be gone when it cannot rest quietly in the bosome 
a grim look will not dash it out of countenance 
so it may finde entertainment 
but when it is daily drawn forth and accused before the throne of grace 
it will not dare to shew the face

that must be shunned

these corrupt and trouble the eye of reason and faith

and bringing upon our selves those evil and dangers which by the vitiousness of men 
are wont to follow the profession of the truth 
6 
pertinacy
in defending the opinions which heretofore we have taken up 
or received from others 
secondly 
the meanes whereby the truth is obtained 
must be used with diligence and constancy 
and they are 
1 
diligent and attentive reading and hearing of the holy scriptures 
and other good 
sound 
approved authours

3 
ardent desire and study to learn the truth of others 
and to search it out by industry and paines 
the instruction of the teacher 
without paines and diligence in the learner 
is not effectuall for the gaining of sound knowledge 
the preaching of the word cannot make men skilfull in spirituall things 
unless their be added desire to learn those things 
which be propounded in the word of god 
these two are partiall causes of knowledge 
which must both concurre to the producing of that effect

of the second operation of man 
viz 
memory 
wherein it consists 
upon what things the memories of the godly are to be exercised 
what it is to remember things after an holy manner 
with the benefits of such a remembrance 
the course to be taken for the obtaining an holy memory 
and what the sinnes 
that are opposite thereunto 
which mst be shunned
question 
what is a second operation of man
a 
memory or remembrance 
whereby we keep things knownnihil prodesse potest homini innatam esse re percipiendae potestatem 
nifi haberet etiam ejusdem retinendae facultatem

bonus &amp 
accuratus intellector facit felicem memoratorem 
verbaque praevisam rem non invita sequentur 
or call to mind what we had forgotten 
as in all things the force of conserving doth depend upon the force of getting and laying up 
so also in man the force of keeping doth wholly depend of the force of forming and judging that image 
which ought to be conserved 
and therefore the memory is never happy 
where there hath not gone before a good understanding 
if things be not laid up well in the chest 
they can never be kept well in the chest 
he can never have an happy memory 
who hath not a good understanding 
it is a good part of memory 
to understand the matter throughly 
distinctly 
explicitely 
then order causeth that what hath once overslipped 
to be easily recalled 
memory standeth specially in three things 
understanding 
order 
care 
in order of nature memory of words 
doth depend upon memory of the things 
and they do happily remember words 
and the propriety which is in severall words 
who have obtained the understanding of the things 
and by the things do commit the words to memory 
the memory of things is conserved and strengthened by the same meanes 
or places by which the knowledge of things is obtained 
for memory doth answer unto and depend upon the understanding 
he that excelleth with a wit explicative and probative 
he doth happily call to remembrance things forgotten 
and that speedily and upon every light occasion 
and this is done by the essentiall vertue of order 
which by it own nature doth further remembrance 
as light of it self is visible 
and needs not to be enlightened of any other thing 
the causes of remembrance of things forgotten 
are 
first 
diligent disquisition made by the causes 
effects 
adjuncts 
and reasonings from
one thing to another 
secondly 
restauration or recovery of the conceit of the thing formerly understood 
which before was lost 
or at least obscured 
the furtherance of it is consideration of the circumstances 
specially of the time past 
wherein we know or apprehended such a thing as we desire to call to remembrance

the safe keeping of what we know 
is the best meanes to increase and grow rich in spirituall understanding 
christ is the onely alchimist 
men of small gettings grow to great substance by continuall saving 
holding together what they have gotten 
and adding somewhat to it daily 
should one have never so great takings 
if one should filch out his gaine as it came in he should never increase in substance 
if men spend as they get 
let the sea of wealth flow in upon them 
yet they shall never have but from hand to mouth 
so it is with christians that hear much 
lay up nothing 
they cannot thrive in grace or knowledge 
but who so keepeth what he hath received 
and addeth somewhat to his former store 
he shall increase abundantly

q 
what course should be taken to obtain an holy memory
a 
1 
boisterous passions and ungodly lusts must be subdued and brought into subjection 
as anger 
fear 
immoderate shame 
&ampc 
envy 
covetousness 
pleasure 
&ampc 
for the truth cannot make impression in a distempered heart 
no more then the face can cause reflection in troubled waters 
besides 
as with a sponge men blot out what they have written in tables 
so doth passion what is engraven in the understanding 
2 
things that we would keep sure 
must distinctly 
soundly 
explicitely be understoodmens distincta melius apprehendit 
quam confusa 
prompta recordatio 
a perfectā rerum memorandarum intellectione 
magná exparte provenit 
methodus catena memoriae 
good lessons do easily fall from us 
because we leave off to study them before we well conceive the truth 
whereas if we would dwell longer in the search of what we slightly apprehend 
we should the better keep what we have found 
and recall it as occasion requireth 
3 
he that would faithfully retain what he hath learned 
must be instructed in the principles of religion 
that he may be able to referre what he heareth 
observeth 
and hath seen 
to some head 
order is to memory 
as light to the eye 
the merchant that knowes not where to finde any thing 
so long as his wares lie confused in an heape 
can readily shew every thing when they be sorted into their places 
ye are dull of hearing 
because ye have need to be taught what are the first principles of religion 
heb 
511 
12 
the man that is well catechised 
is best able to lay up and keep safe what he hath received 
it is not to be thought that by this meanes we can obtain the remembrance of every word in each sentence 
but the generall sense and substance of matter we shall keep in minde 
4 
sinister cogitations and by-thoughts must be forgotten 
when we would commit any thing to memory 
for forgetfulness is such a beginning of memory 
as privation is of generation 
the minde distracted with vaine cogitations 
cannot seriously fasten the stampe or impression of things received upon the retentive faculty 
thou must succinctly gather thy self together 
and gird up the loynes of the minde 
the face is not seen in running waters 
nor can things understood be written in memory 
if the powers of imagination be not united close and fixed upon it 
lead is capable of engraven charectars 
because it is firme and solid quick-silver 
because fluid 
will not admit them 
in like manner an inconstant wandering minde 
which is carried into new 
strang 
divers cogitations 
can reape small fruit by what he readeth or heareth 
5 
in reading or hearing thou must diligently observe the matter intreated of 
the ground of the discourse 
the arguments whereby it is confirmed 
the methode in which it is handled 
and the similitudes wherewith it is illustrated 
if the methode be exact and perfect 
it doth most availe to the remembrance of the whole 
for what went before 
will give light to that which followeth 
and one thing draw on another 
and as for similitudes 
as they convince 
affect 
and give light 
so do they much further memory by their perspicuity 
familiarity 
and powerfull operation 
6 
the chief heads of what we read or hear 
must briefly 
yet heedfully be runne over 
before one thing
have driven out another 
but in recalling the principall points already delivered 
we must take care 
that what is spoken for the present 
do not over-slip us 
and if we cannot readily call to minde some head propounded 
whiles we are busied in hearing 
we must not stand long to discourse about it 
but pass forward to some other things 
and return again to enquire after it as opportunity is offered 
7 
delight and care is a great stay to memory 
old men remember what they regard 
the shortest wit can call to minde where he laid his gold 
i will delight my self in thy statutes 
i will not forget thy words 
psal 
11916 
8 
work the heart to a lively sense of what we hear 
read or apprehend 
whatsoever doth affect with more then ordinary joy or sorrow 
that is not easily blotted out 
why do men remember their wrongs received 
sicknesses felt 
travels undertaken 
and apparent dangers escaped 
because they are sensible of them 
the doctrine that doth affect kindly 
will stick fast by us 
9 
take speciall notice of that which thou hast not learned or heard before 
think upon it often and seriously 
for things before learned and digested 
will more easily return into memory upon the hearing or repitition 
10 
experience is a great prop to memory 
we can with much ease call to minde what paine we endured in sickness 
what meanes we used for recovery 
once repetition is sufficient to present all this afresh unto the understanding 
get experience of the word 
and finde the truth of it in thy self 
so will it easily be borne in remembrance 
what is there almost in the whole book of god 
whereof a christian renewed by grace 
may not have experience in himself 
if he will take paines to become acquainted with his own soul 
and to get possession of the word 
what the scripture saith of the miserable and sinfull estate of man by nature 
he findeth and feeleth in himself 
and if we discerne not the work of grace 
enjoy not the comfort of the promise 
temporall and spirituall 
all is not as it ought to be 
11 
meditation is the chief help of memory 
for it doth concoct and digest what is heard 
that it may be laid up with more safety 
the manner of meditation is 
1 
to learn by parts what we would commit to memory 
that is 
we must call to minde and busie our thoughts upon one part after another 
till the whole be runne over 
and then repeate the whole in the same order and methode in which it was delivered or set down 
2 
if the minde be fluid and wandering 
it is not amisse to use the helpe of a mild 
moderate voice 
and to learn by heart with a still noise or murmuring 
that the memory may be holpen with the double motion of repeating and hearing 
and the heart kept from straying and roving up and down 
but if the mind be firme and stayed 
it is a more expedient way and stronger to imprint notions 
to repeate them with silence 
in thought without the use of the voice 
3 
if any point or memorable part have over-slipped us 
we must by diligent search and enquiry labour to finde it our 
calling to mind what went before 
what followed after 
to what place or head of divinity we referred it in hearing 
considering what might be spoken in that matter more then we remember to be delivered 
what we have read or observed in others 
if by this meanes thou canst not recover it 
aske of thy companion or familiar friend with whom thou art lincked in society 
for by his assistance that may be regained 
which of thy self thou canst not finde 
4 
what thou hast learned or observed in the day 
that repeate at night before thou betake thy self to rest 
that what is lightly imprinted in the minde by day thoughts 
may be firmely sealed by night cogitations 
and it is wonderfull to be spoken 
and not easie to be unfolded 
what firmeness 
the silent resting of the minde upon a matter all night without distraction 
doth bring to memory 
5 
as soon as sleep is shaken
off 
and thou hast made thy self ready 
before thou settest upon other studies or business 
recall to minde in the morning 
what thou hast meditated over-night 
for it profiteth little to meditate before sleep 
unless thou ruminate upon it after sleep 
6 
the fittest time to begin this meditaion 
is immediately after thou hast heard or read what thou desirest to be laid up 
before the minde be called from it by other occasions 
or satan have stolen the word out of the heart 
good husbands cover their seed with the harrow as soon as they cast it into the ground 
least the fowles of heaven should devoure and pick it up 
7 
because a vehement and bent inclination of minde is required in meditation 
which doth much weaken the spirits 
we must take heed that we spend not too much time in meditation 
least the edge of the minde be dulled therewith 
and because we assigne but little time to meditation 
we must take heed that we lose no moment of that time 
but when it is necessary to meditate 
do that willingly 
and without tediousness 
which is necessary 
12 
the minde is to be exercised daily in the learning and recalling some thing that is good and profitable 
that by the use and exercise of remembring 
memory might be perfected 
for as the strength of body is increased by continuall labour and exercise 
but diminished by sloth and intermission of labour 
so the vigour of mind is revived by exercise and daily study 
by intermission and sloth it is withered and drieth up 
and as frequent disputation makes a skilfull logician 
and frequent declaiming a skilfull oratour 
so the frequent practice of committing things to memory 
doth make a more prompt memory 
for there is nothing that doth more rejoyce in labour and work 
nothing that is more easily corrupted 
and gathereth rust with rest and idleness 
then memory 
use makes the work-man 
13 
read and hear the word of god with application 
and labour to make that thine own 
for if we joyn confession 
prayer 
supplication 
intercession and thanksgiving 
as occasion is given from those things we hear or read 
we shall not onely remember them better 
but we shall edifie our conscience 
and if the stamp of the truth be fixed upon our hearts 
and appeare in our conversation 
it will not be hard to recall it 
because looking upon our selves we shall finde it engraven in our breasts 
and shining in our practice 
14 
divine aide is to be craved by earnest and continuall prayers 
that by his grace he would sanctifie our hearts 
for the influences of divine grace poured of god into our hearts 
do much recreate and refresh them

fifthly 
the scripture dfferenceth the ungodly from the righteous 
more by their thoughts 
then by their words and actions 
the thoughts of the righteous are right 
but the counsels of the wicked are deceit 
prov 
125 
others cannot judge of us but by externall works 
sayings and doings 
but we must pass sentence of our selves according to our inward cogitations 
for they are the fruits 
that best shew the sap of the tree 
according to which we may give judgment 
if the sap be evill 
as all men
are by nature the thoughts are answerable 
if we be changed by the power of the holy ghost 
the cogitations are suitable 
fruits follow the nature of the sap and soile 
where bred and nourished 
children resemble their naturall parents 
sometimes this may faile in the naturall generation 
in the spirituall 
never 
the mind alwaies begetteth conceits like unto it self 
words and actions are open to sight 
subject to the punishment of law 
for which cause they are often cunningly forced 
disguised 
constrained 
the heart purposing one thing 
the tongue and hand going another way 
as one may talk of honesty 
liberality 
love 
whose heart is set on wickedness 
covetousness 
malice 
satan can change himself into an angel of light 
so can his ministers 
nothing being more common 
then for him 
that intends mischief 
to pretend friendship 
but thoughts are more free 
being naturally discerned by him onely that seeth the heart 
trieth the reines 
and keepeth a court for the conscience 
who then is afraid of evil imaginations 
onely that man that dreadeth the presence of god 
trembleth at his word 
and hath his heart filled with awe of his majesty 
thoughts are the immediate issues or productions of the mind 
a perfect image and resemblance of the soul 
naturally expressing the quality and disposition of it 
as streames do the nature of fountains whence they flow 
but words and actions are more remote 
subject to mixture 
and cannot give so clear and lively representation of the hidden man 
many millions of thoughts and formes of imaginations are framed continually within 
and do spring out of the heart 
without mask or fear 
reservation or restraint 
being exempted by reason of their secrecy from the priviest search that man can make 
but words and actions are obvious to censure 
and shadowed with false colours 
the soul fashioneth thoughts according to her mould and temperature 
but externall fruits are coloured according to the times 
companies with whom we converse 
or purposes intendedluk

sixthly 
the godly and ungodly 
both are chalenged for their evill thoughts or imaginations 
why do thoughts arise in your hearts 
god saw that the wickedness of man was great upon earth 
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evill continually 
the thoughts of the wicked are abomination to the lord 
their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity 
jesus knowing the thoughts of the scribes 
said 
wherefore think ye evill in your hearts 
if all prophesie 
and there come in one that believeth not 
or one unlearned 
he is convinced of all 
he is judged of all 
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest 
but if the word convince of evill thoughts 
or command good 
they are not free 
seventhly 
man being created of god after his image 
in righteousness and true holiness 
doth owe absolute and intire obedience unto his majesty 
in the whole man 
and all the powers thereof 
he is our supream and absolute sovereign 
and we his subjects 
to do him all spirituall homage 
eighthly 
in the state of grace we are renewed in the inner man 
in the spirit of our mind 
our hearts are purified by faith 
and washed with the pure and clean water that issueth out of the sanctuary 
but if the disposition of the soul be changed 
and new qualities produced 
the thoughts of the heart must not be rotten and corrupt 
ninthly 
thoughts do knit the heart to god 
or draw and turn it from him 
good thoughts do much further communion with his majesty 
evill thoughts hale the soul another way
q 
how are men drawn to think that thoughts are free
a 
1 
the laws of men take no hold of them 
and most men esteeme things according to ordinary proceedings in courts of justice 
but gods sovereignty is not like mans 
nor his sight as mans 
nor his law as the laws of men 
he is of absolute sovereignty 
he seeth the heart 
and by his law obligeth the thoughts and motions of the soul to good abearance 
the men of this world expect heartty love from friends 
willing subjection from inferiours 
and esteeme kindness according to the good will of the party from whom it proceedeth 
no
marvell then if the lord require subjection in heart and thought 
2 
it is not possible to avoid evill thoughts 
and we are apt to think nothing amisse that cannot easily be forgone 
but if we cannot avoid evill imaginations 
the greater is our sinne 
bondage 
and misery 
which we must acknowledge before god with shame and confusion of face 
though we cannot avoid them 
we must condemn them 
and by all holy and good meanes strive to subdue and overcome them through the power of jesus christ 
we are the souldiers of jesus christ 
and must fight against those fleshly lusts that rebell against the spirit 
nor is this bootless 
though we obtain not perfect victory 
for if they be let alone they will quench the spirit 
and wholly over-spred us 
but if we mortifie them by the power of grace 
they shall not get head 
but rather they shall wither by little and little 
and be as spurres to drive us to god in prayer and well doing 
3 
they come suddenly and unexpectedly sometimes against liking and approbation 
and therefore men imagine no reason that account should be given for them 
but the suddain rise of evill imaginations argueth the deep corruption of the heart 
which is not yet purged as it ought 
again 
they are condemned by the law 
because exorbitant and reasonless 
and the wise in heart will not faile to be humbled for them 
and to seek their removall that they prevaile not to pester and molest the quiet disposition of soul 
is it a light matter that the heart should be taken up with unreasonable imaginations 
when it should be set upon god 
and stand prepared with every power to do him service 
4 
thoughts do no body any harme 
if the blind conceit of most men may be taken for true sentence but when they are aberrations from the law of god 
tend to the dishonour of his glorious name 
rob him of his glory 
are the greatest galls to an holy heart 
that would faine intirely solace it self in god 
how can we suppose they do no hurt 
besides 
they do hurt many waies 
for they are the grounds of all evill 
the hinderances of much good 
and in that respect more especially to be judged and reformed 
5 
gross ignorance of god and his law 
reigneth in the most men 
for they conceive of both according to their carnall apprehensions 
and judge nothing to be disallowed of the most holy lord in his righteous law 
but what is cross to their likings and approbations 
in the night men discerne not the danger of their way 
nor can the ignorant take notice of the hainousness of their wicked imaginations 
6 
the reformation of the thoughts 
is a work of much labour and tediousness 
in comparison of that we need to take about our words and actions 
specially if we strive no further then to approve our selves before men 
and the better to free our selves from this labourious toyl of keeping imaginations in compass 
we flatter our souls as if it were sufficient to look to the right ordering of the outward man 
preferring a treacherous and base peace 
to a safe and honourable warre 
7 
by nature we are sick of self-love 
apt to think well of our selves 
not willing to cross our desires in that which is pleasing unto them 
but this we cannot do 
if we look to our thoughts 
for their aberration will soon discover to man the loathsome filthiness of his heart 
his proneness to evill 
and untowardness to good 
that he must dote extreamly 
if knowing the truth of his naturall estate 
he can be in love with himself 
or indulgent to his own desires 
and this may be some reason 
why of self-love we perswade our selves that thought is free 
that we might not come to the sight of our nakedness
q 
what is the danger of this delusion
a 
the mischiefs of it are many and great 
first 
it denieth the government of god in the heart and conscience 
to whose authority every thought should yeeld subjection 
secondly 
it keepeth men ignorant of their naturall estate 
that they cannot bewaile their condition 
nor earnestly seek unto jesus christ to be healed and refreshed 
thirdly 
it produceth a presumptuous
power to limit and prescribe the ordinances 
that they ought not to search the heart 
captivate the thoughts 
and bring them into obedience 
but that they serve onely as matters of policy 
with some to approve and maintain civill honesty and outward holiness 
for the attaining of worldly ends 
fourthly 
it nourisheth security 
hardness of heart 
and desperate impenitency 
for how can that man labour the amendment of his heart and life 
that thinketh no holiness necessary 
but onely outward conformity to the laws 
how can he offer up his heart to god 
that freely letteth it loose 
to wander up and down in every sinfull vanity 
fifthly 
god in his just and rightous judgment 
when he seeth men to be regardless of his present doth give them over to the temptations of satan 
and the sinfull lusts of their own hearts 
whereby they are carried to all excess of riot 
to commit sinne with greediness 
sixthly 
neglect of our thoughts 
is the nurse of pride 
presumption 
and self-conceitedness 
he can never know how poor and naked he is by nature 
what daily need he hath of continuall assistance from above 
how farre he is from perfection 
that doth not set upon the mastery of his thoughts

q how may thoughts be divided

they are good or evill
q what are good thoughts
a 
they are motions of the sanctified heart 
stirred up in us by the spirit of god 
whereby we seasonably and holily weigh and consider with our selves what we know and understand 
that we might be affected according as the nature of the thing requireth 
the root of holy thoughts 
is a sanctified heart 
for men gather not grapes of thornes 
nor figs of thistles 
psal 
14 2 
the tree must be good before the fruit can be good 
if the vine be not generous 
the grape is not sweet 
according to the work of grace in the soul 
and the remainders of gods image 
so are the thoughts of men 
in the naturall man there remaineth some reliques of the defaced image of god 
and he may have some thoughts good in themselves 
touching morall vertues 
and the affaires of this life 
in the temporary believer there is some work of the spirit 
but superficiall 
and of an inferiour nature 
and according to this work 
so are his thoughts touching the affairs of heaven 
slight 
inconstant 
subordinate 
the true christian is soundly wrought upon by the spirit of sanctification 
and his thoughts are answerable to the disposition of his soul 
solid 
substantiall 
lively 
constant 
and pleasing to god 
the author of all good cogitations is the spirit of god 
for we of our selves are not no not the regenerate sufficient to think a good thought 
but all our sufficiency is of god 
2 cor

q 
what is the benefit of good thoughts or cogitations
psal 
13923a 
exceeding great 
first 
they are notable evidences of integrity and growth in grace 
as our hearts are less pestered with worldly and carnall thoughts 
as they are more replenished with heavenly meditations 
so have we gotten a greater hand over corruptions 
so have we a more plentifull increase of the grace of god 
as good meditations and thoughts do more abide with us 
are more affected and delighted in 
and are more powerfull to enable us to holy actions 
so doth the grace of god increase in us 
secondly 
they are gracious trials and warrants of sincerity in all private duties and outward actions
for it is not so much what we do 
as what we mind 
what the lips utter 
as what the heart indites 
not what the eye or ear attendspsal 
516 
1 king 
839 
as what the thoughts and affections fasten on 
the lord loveth truth in the inward parts 
and regards the outward service according to the inward intention 
thirdly 
good thoughts are sensible tokens of present grace 
and strong inflamers of earnest desires after more grace 
cogitation kindles desire 
and as our thoughts 
so are our desires of heavenly things 
fourthly 
good thoughts are messengers of happy reconciliation with god1 thes 
523 
for god sheweth himself to be at peace with us 
when he sanctifieth our nature 
and every heavenly motion of the heart to what is truly good 
is an embassadour sent from heaven to assure us of peace concluded 
never to be disanulled 
fifthly 
incredible is the comfort of good thoughtspsal 
13917 
in nothing do we more resemble the purity and simplicity of god 
in nothing do we more communicate with him 
then in our nimble and pure thoughts 
by these 
when absent in body 
we are present with him 
by these 
when the body resteth in the night 
the soul may solace it self with god 
when we want opportunity to hear 
read 
or pray solemnly 
by holy cogitations we may conferre with god
q 
is it lawfull to think upon our sinnes or transgressions
a 
in a seasonable and holy manner it is lawfull to think upon our sinnes past 
and present infirmities 
that the heart may be stirred up to more tenderness 
godly sorrow 
and detestation of them 
but wisdome and circumspection must be used 
lest whilest we endeavour to work the soul to the hatred of evill 
it be secretly ensnared and defiled with the delight thereof
q 
what is the issue of good thoughts
a 
they provoke to an actuall and constant approbation and practice of what is pure 
honest 
praise-worthy 
and of good report 
they refresh the heart with sweet content 
joy and comfort 
they raise the soul to a constant and deliberate detestation of all sinne and wickedness more and more
q 
what are evill thoughts
a 
they are motions of the soul arising from nature 
suggested by satan 
or occasioned by externall objects 
whereby the soul is turned from god in some sort 
and stirred to the dislike of good 
or the liking of evill 
the root of evill cogitations is the corrupt heart 
which is sufficient to poyson the whole man with all kinde of wickedness 
being naturally as a boyling sea 
or sepulchre of corruption 
steeming and vaporating up continually a world of all wicked and ill-disposed imaginations 
satan spareth not to inject evill motions into the heart 
as oyl into the flame 
to make it more vehement and dangerous 
and to hurt and annoy 
he taketh advantage of our corruption 
which is as apt to entertain his suggestions to evill 
as tinder is to take fire 
but the temptations of satan could not hurt 
were not the heart corrupted 
or at least 
did it not yeeld and give place to his allurements 
satan is subtile 
and knoweth in what ground to sow his seed 
he is busie to molest 
and vigilant to take all opportunities to do harme 
but corruption of heart giveth him the advantage 
setteth open the door for him to enter 
giveth ear to his perswasions 
delighteth in his suggestions 
and man himself is the sole authour of all his misery

though good in themselves 
by reason of our corruption 
do occasion evil thoughts 
but this evill is not from the object 
but from the heart that is corrupted 
or willfully turneth aside after evill upon such occasion 
before the fall of man 
evill was first suggested by satan 
and they corrupted themselves by lissening and consenting to that temptation 
which they might have repelled 
but would not 
but since the transgression of our first parents 
the heart is poysoned of it self 
apt to send forth evill motions 
which are increased and inflamed
by the injections of satan 
and seconded by the world with all occasions that are therein 
all serving as fuel to augment the fire 
and as matter to nourish and maintain it 
till all be set on fire

20a 
the thoughts of the wicked are an abhomination to the lord 
first 
evill thoughts proceed from a corrupt heart 
and argue the fountain whence they issue to be unclean 
secondly 
evill thoughts are the seed and parents of all wickedness 
and what justice is it to punish the children 
and let the mother go free 
if common reason do award that the principall must be punished 
at least equall with the accessary 
then must not evill thoughts escape the censure 
seeing they are ring-leaders 
and fire-brands to all sinnes 
for no outward objects and occasions could hurt 
but by the thoughts embracing and affecting them 
nay 
if the greater sinne 
the greater punishment 
then evill thoughts cannot pass free 
in that they are often conceived 
harboured 
delighted in 
nourished 
cloaked 
and so made the greatest sinnes 
thirdly 
in cases of treason 
and some other 
humane laws condemn thoughts and purposes of evill 
though they break not forth into action 
that others may be terrified from imagining and contriving the like against such eminent persons or so near unto us 
which reasons do much more condemn the evill of thoughts 
being commence against the great god 
who infinitly excelleth all earthly sovereignty 
and meeteth with evill thoughts to prevent the out-breach of evils 
fourthly 
husbandmen that would rid their grounds of noysome weeds 
do not onely cut down the herb or stalke 
but pluck up the root 
as knowing their labour would else be vaine and to no purpose 
if we strive not the stifling of corrupt imaginations 
it will profit but little to lop off the buds and blossoms of other sinnes 
when the corrupt heart is a nest or cave wherein many unclean birds are hatched 
not onely the birds are to be killed 
but the cage or nest is to be cleansed 
which cannot be done 
if we suffer wicked thoughts to lodge quietly 
and labour not their removall 
what reformation or cleanness is that 
to cleanse the outside of the cup or platter 
and suffer the inside to remain corrupted with rust and filthiness 
fifthly 
amongst mortall men 
what king or prince 
though never so potent 
who doth not exact of his subjects an account of pence and half-pence 
and not onely of hundreds and thousands 
why should we think that god will not reckon with us for our thoughts 
as well as for our words and actions 
when god made the whole man entire and perfect 
not onely in words and actions 
but in thoughts 
by good right he may exact that innocency 
which he bestowed 
and when as men punish the evill that falleth under the sense of their eyes or ears 
why should not god 
who knoweth 
seeth 
and heareth what the heart speaketh 
shew himself a revenger of that hidden wickedness 
sixthly 
it is no small offence to suffer the heart or any power thereof to be withdrawn from godmat 
1519 
to whom we owe our selves and all that we have 
but every wicked thought withdrawes the heart from god 
or some power of it 
for the power 
whereby conceits are framed in the mind 
is from god 
and should be imploied constantly in obedience to his will 
according to his commandement 
seventhly 
evill thoughts allay the heate of the spirit 
defile the heart 
interrupt and disturbe the holy performance of good duties 
and the acceptance of them with god 
and as good thoughts minister occasion of sweet rejocing and incredible comfort 
so on the contrary 
evill thoughts do cause much grief and sorrow 
to say nothing 
that they fill the heart with much restless unquietness 
and continuall torture and vexation 
the thoughts of the proud 
cholerick 
ambitious 
covetous 
how do they pierce the bones 
eat up the marrow 
eighthly 
evill thoughts concerning god or man 
argue want of love to god and man 
why are we apter to follow vanity 
then to commune with the lord 
but because these things beare too great sway in the heart 
when the fear of men restraineth
from evill speeches 
or actions 
why doth not the fear of god keep the heart from conceiving or plodding upon idle 
vaine 
wicked things 
but because the heart is desperately wicked 
and destitute of the fear of god 
at least in great measure 
ninthly 
evill thoughts are arguments of gods displeasure 
specially if reigning and rebellious 
for every high thought that exalteth it self against the knowledge of god 
must be brought into subjection 
before perfect peace can be possessed with god
q 
are onely thoughts in themselves unlawfull to be esteemed evill
a 
no 
but vaine 
idle and unseasonable imaginations 
excessive thoughts about the affairs of this life 
unseasonable thoughts about things of a better life 
are not onely without fruit 
but unlawfull 
as for a man to be thinking upon some point of instruction that he hath heard or learned

q 
what rules are to be observed for the good government of our thoughts
a 
1 
it is good to begin the day with holy thoughts and meditations 
not suffering our selves to be interrupted by any unnecessary occasions 
give god thy first thoughts 
that he may hold the chief part in thy heart 
and this will sweetly relish the heart 
and by estranging it from worldly impediments 
fit itpsal 
1081 
&amp 
13918 
psal

and keep it in preparedness for all good occasions 
2 
discerne wisely between thy thoughts 
and avoid all unnecessary imaginations 
amongst those that be good lay hold on them that be most fit and necessary 
fastening thy thoughts distinctly upon some one thing 
and pursuing it untill it be brought to some issue 
it is the policy of satan to seek our hinderance 
by drawing our minds from one thing to another 
without fruit or benefit 
it must be our wisdome to watch against his subtilty 
that we be not deceived 
3 
restraine thy thoughts to such particular duties 
as are incident to each season and occasion 
and herein avoid vaine speculation and curiosity 
let it suffice to know things revealed 
and keep thy thoughts in obedience to the will of god 
4 
spend thy speciall thoughts in the meditation of gods nature 
properties and works 
his grace and lovepsal

the death of christ 
the benefits of his passion

thine estate in grace 
how thou art to walk 
what duties god requireth 
how thou maist preserve communion and maintain peace with him 
adde unto these 
some thoughts of the miseries of the times 
the distresses of the church 
and the coming of christ unto judgment 
these are matters of speciall importance about which our thoughts should be busied in all earnestness 
5 
if thy thoughts concern the world 
put them back 
keep them from the world 
save onely as much as needs must 
for the moderate maintaining of thee and thine2 tim 69 
lest heavenly thoughts be drowned and hindered 
the reason is 
because our hearts being earthly 
do presently conceive a sweetness in earthly things 
now spirituall wisdome requireth 
that we diminish the love of the creature 
that we may increase the love of the creatour 
but if they will runne upon the world 
then turn the course of them a little 
to consider the vanity and misery of the evill world 
the painted vizor of the pleasures of it 
the uncertainty of life 
the deceitfulness of riches 
how they be not ours 
what evils and incumbrances we have received from the world 
what fools they have made us in treasuring on earth 
whose home and expectation is in heaven 
6 
if thy thoughts concern thy self 
or others thy brethren 
labour to think better of others then thy selfphil 
23 
for thou seeft no such thing in them as in thy self 
yea 
the more thou seemest to excell others in gifts 
the more humble labour to be 
for this purpose 
conceive not onely what thou hast received 
but what thou wantest 
and what good things thou art without 
and then with paul sayphil 
312 
thou hast not yet attained to perfection 
7 
if thy thoughts concern any sinne 
be sure it be to hate and renounce 
to bewaile and mourn for it 
in thy self or others 
for there is a slyneass
and subtilty in sinne 
which while we think of 
it easily gaineth some tickling and consent 
which at least hindreth that through-hatred 
that we ought to maintain against it 
8 
rectifie thoughts daily by reading the word of god 
and often private prayer 
9 
it is good to take occasion in the night 
to exercise our thoughts on god 
and such occasions as then shall be seasonably offered 
breaking our sleep not unwillingly to this end
q 
but wandering 
idle 
unseasonable 
wicked thoughts will still be creeping into the mind 
how are we to deale with them
a 
we must withdraw our selves as much as may be from worldly vanity 
and not give the least way to wandering and foolish thoughts 
but strive earnestly to suppress them with all speed 
and to this end 
1 
we must examine our thoughts whence they come 
and whither they go 
and what they do in us 
by this meanes we shall banish a number of idle and wandering thoughts 
which like roving vagrants 
being worth nothing 
come either to steale something 
either time or grace 
and so shall we make room for better 
sturdy loiterers will not haunt where strict government is exercised 
nor idle thoughts dare frequently to shew their head 
where diligent inquisition is made after them 
2 
we must humble and aflict our selves for the vanity of our minds 
and deceitfulness of our hearts 
which minister occasions of such infinite imaginations 
let us consider with our selves 
what misery it is to be clogged with such a burden of idle cogitations 
much more to stand guilty of taking pleasure and delight therein 
how is the soul distempered 
that can admit of vaine discourses 
when she might better be imploied in cogitations about the joyes of heaven 
it argueth want of wit 
or love to sloth 
when men stand pidling about strawes and stickes 
neglecting business of weight when season serveth 
oh 
the folly and vanity that swayeth within me 
that can give way to roving thoughts 
idle 
unprofitable 
good for nothing 
when with more benefit and comfort i might imploy my self in the meditation of heavenly things 
thus are we to obey the checks of conscience convincing these thoughts 
and to sharpen it that it may censure more 
and we be more deeply humbled for them 
3 
strive we to cleanse the heart from vanity and sinne 
and to store and enrich it with grace more and more 
the best methode to cure the disease is to remove the cause 
sweeten the fountain 
and the waters will not remaine bitter 
specially we must labour against pride 
self-sufficiency and covetousness 
which minister most common and dangerous matter of idle 
sinfull and wounding thoughts 
4 
we must stirre up our selves to delight in god 
and in his word 
for where our treasure isprov

22 
there will our hearts be also 
if knowledge be pleasant to the soul 
it will lead thee 
when thou goest 
and keep thee 
when thou sleepest 
and talke with thee 
when thou wakest
q how are the minds of good christians usually occupied or taken up

1314a 
the honest and sound-hearted christian hath sold all that he hath 
to buy the pearle of price 
found in the gospel 
by the spirit of grace he hath mortified 
as all other sinnes 
so the beloved sinne of his unregeneracy 
to which he yeelded submission in the daies of ignorance 
his heart is purged 
his delights altered 
the world he doth trample under feet 
and renounce the sinnes that he followed with greediness2 cor

he is betrothed unto christ 
as a pure virgin espoused unto an husband 
and nothing can please so much as communion with him 
the streame 
heate and intention of all his thoughts do runne after god 
his good affections of loveluk

joy 
delight 
reverence 
&ampc 
are improved for the best service of his majesty 
and the good of his people 
this is the heavenly temper of his soul 
and the cogitations moulded therein 
are such as these 
1 
having upon mature deliberation cast off the delight of all sinnes 
he doth with all earnestness ponder and consider the vanity and misery of his
former course 
and bethink himself how he may weaken 
suppress and keep under 
as all other 
so especially the sinne of his love 
of his inclination 
which as he well perceives did most wound his conscience 
waste his spirituall estate 
defile his soul 
and is most likeliy to do him a displeasure 
as that which hangeth fast 
sueth earnestly 
and may easily circumvent 
as in a besieged city 
look where the greatest breach is made 
there the inhabitants do concurre with greatest strength and resolution to make it up 
or ressist the entrance of the enemy 
so this wise souldier of jesus christ finding what sinne hath made widest and most dangerous gaps in his conscience 
doth omit no good meanes to fortifie himself and make resistance against it 
to crucifie 
kill 
and keep it under for ever 
for knowing that he must die 
if sinne live in him 
he is willing to be the executioner of his best pleasing sinnes 
that he might escape himself 
in which resolution he is so firmely settled 
that no perswasions 
allurements 
or fair promises of sinne can alter his determination 
or cause the delay of his intended purpose 
2 
this good soul sets his thoughts upon the pearle and treasure which he hath found and bought 
upon this one thing necessary 
they runne with greatest content and comfort 
if any man in deep distress 
should finde upon the way some precious stone 
that is of value abundantly sufficient to supply his wants 
hardly could he keep his eyes from gazing upon it 
or restrain his thoughts from musing upon his good hap 
and happy condition 
his excess of joy conceived would both command and confine his sight and heart 
to that so rare 
hopefull 
and welcome object 
shall not we then conclude 
that a man illightned to see his spirituall nakedness and misery 
with the excellency of all heavenly graces that are to be found in christ 
and enabled by faith 
to lay hold upon all the promises of mercy made in the gospel 
shall we not conclude i say that he will rejoyce in this favour for ever 
and spend the most 
the dearest 
the noblest of his thoughts upon this happinessmat 
1344 
the wise man considers the pearle before he buy it 
after consideration he cannot be quiet till he have gotten possession 
and possessing it 
he is both cheered and refreshed with the worth and beauty of it 
so that he is never well but when his cogitations are taken up about it 
he meditates often upon the love of god 
his long suffering 
goodness 
mercy 
and free grace in sparing him so long 
calling him so graciously 
providing such meanes for his recovery 
granting him liberty and encouragment to believe 
and not seldome he is rapt up in admiration of his present happiness 
having passed and escaped the gates of hell 
and whiles he is in discourse about these things 
he seemeth to himself to be in some dreame 
it being scarce credible 
as he supposeth 
that such blissfull state hath befallen him 
3 
having tasted the sweetness of gods favour 
he cannot but desire it more and more 
and in fuller measure to be refreshed with the comforts of it 
therefore he bends all his consultations to this point 
viz 
how he may come to more familiar and better acquaintance with god 
but of this in the next operation of man 
4 
nor can an honest heart be unmindful of the rich mercies and incomprehensible kindnesses vouchsafed to him a most wretched sinner 
he freely acknowledgeth himself indebted for infinite blessings 
and not being able to recompense the least 
in all humility he devoteth himself wholly to the service of god 
crying out with the prophet 
what shall i render to the lordpsal 
11612 
2 sam 
718 
for all his mercies 
o lord i am less then the least of thy mercies 
5 
inasmuch as the righteous are still clogged with sinne that abideth in them 
though sanctified in part 
and are but weak 
though willing to be better 
they do earnestly bethink themselves in what they come short 
and how they might subdue their evill lusts 
and chase away those vaine 
noysome 
wicked thoughts 
which still arise from the stinking puddle of corruption 
and they unfeignedly study and desire that not onely their words and actions might be acceptable 
but their thoughts pleasing in the sight of god 
which grace they begge by
fervent prayer 
and in part obtain
q 
ʋnregenerate men and temporary believers do think of good matters sometimes 
how then do the thoughts of the godly differ from theirs
a 
when the child of god dislikes himself most 
even then he is farre before the best of the other 
who have not their thoughts freely 
voluntarily 
substantially 
in an holy manner 
exercised about heavenly things 
but about carnall liberty 
pleasure 
profit 
long life 
revenge 
even such things as their corrupt heart most desires 
the generall ground of difference is 
that all unregenerate men foster some speciall sinne 
or inferiour good in their bosome 
about which they spend their principall thoughtsmat 
21 
for where the love is 
there the heart is also 
the body may 
the heart cannot be separated from that which is the principall or onely delight and pleasure 
of the three sorts of ground that received seed 
but brought not forth fruit to ripeness 
the best was naught 
and the hearers resembled by those grounds 
were all unsound 
by simon magus practice 
you may judge of his project and the disposition of his heartact 
819 
20 
he believed 
and was baptised 
but had not renounced the world 
some sweet sinne 
matter of pleasure 
ease 
honour 
wealth 
earthly felicity and carnall contentment is harboured in the soul that hath not escaped the bondage of satan 
which he will not abandon by any meanes 
and as sinne is more or less predominant 
so do their thoughts more or less runne after it 
the notorious sinners and gross hypocrites have their cogitations wholly bent upon evill 
for they are purposely resolved in mind to reap in this life what sensuall pleasures soever this world can afford 
and not to be debarred from any meanes availeable thereunto 
the life of a morall honest man is suitable to his thoughts 
he is sober 
temperate 
just 
no brawler 
fighter 
defrauder 
&ampc 
but a despiser of godliness 
an hater of zeal and forwardness 
you may assure your self his note is this 
what needs all this adoe in religion 
this praying 
catechising 
running after sermons 
how did our fore-fathers 
they had not so much teaching 
yet they lived neighbourly together 
had all things plenty 
i will keep the commandements 
do wrong to no man 
follow my business 
live as the rest of my neighbours 
and my trust is to do as well as the best of them all 
thus for matters of piety 
he is no less vile then the former 
though he oppose it not so much openly 
because he loves morall honesty and little medling 
the temporary 
as his heart is seasoned with goodness of nature 
civill honesty 
and generall graces of the spirit 
so are his thoughts more fair 
ingenuous 
sober 
moderate and pious 
then any of the former 
he watcheth over his thoughts in some sort 
as over his words and actions 
as he shunneth gross prophaneness in life 
so he detesteth it in thought 
his heart will rise against suggestions of infamous consequence 
as those of athiesm 
contempt of god 
cruelty 
murther 
adultery 
and such like 
conscience will not suffer him to cast off all care of holy duties 
and practice of divine worship 
he knoweth the necessity of preaching 
and can set forth and speak of the misery of them that want the light of divine truth for their direction 
in regard of present imploiments he may gaine some mastery over thoughts of heaviness 
or melancholy 
over thoughts of rage and revenge 
to prosecute his present occasions more cheerfully 
nor is he altogether careless of the thoughts that molest and trouble him in the practice of good duties 
as hearing the word 
prayer 
&ampc 
for he hath learned not to rest in the work done 
as though bodily exercise were all that is required 
thus farre may this unsound believer go towards the practice of true piety in his cogitations 
but stil his heart is earthly 
principally affecting things subject to sense 
whereas the heart of a sound christian is heavenly 
burning with love to christ 
which causeth maine differences in their thoughts 
first 
the temporary without check or scruple letteth loose his imaginations to idleness 
and vanity 
to fruitless rovings 
specially to worldliness 
earthly-mindedness 
or vaine pleasure 
for the heart still holds her interest in these
things 
and embraceth them with dearest affection 
as for the upright man 
he hath renounced the world with the affections and lusts 
and chosen god to be his portion 
and his thoughts are intended and purposed to the things of a better life 
he suffers not his heart to runne after his eye 
no not so much as to be delighted with it 
to be ensnared with the pleasure of it 
but by all meanes he seeks to stifle it at the first rising 
secondly 
you must conceive that the temporary christian 
notwithstanding his glorious profession 
hath set up some idol in his heart 
to which he doth service with his best and dearest thoughts 
with greatest fervency and continuance 
to which gods honour 
word 
and worship 
the motions of the spirit 
checks of conscience 
and admonitions of friends are made subordinate 
but the thoughts of gods child are chiefly set upon that one thing which is necessary 
subordinating all other thoughts thereunto 
and therefore he useth all holy meanes to nourish holy thoughts 
as prayer 
hearing 
and reading the word 
and avoideth carefully all meanes which may interrupt or divert them 
as idleness 
ill company 
wicked objects 
wandering of the senses 
discontent 
thirdly 
spirituall affairs 
care of salvation 
thoughts concerning the sincere worship and service of god 
come into the heart of the temporary believer by accident 
and at reversion 
their entertainment is so cold and weak 
that other matters better welcome justle them out of oores 
they never affect the soul deeply to cause a deliberate and well-advised resolution to pursue them above all transitory things that perish with the use 
but if the mind fasten upon its beloved object 
it dwelleth long upon it without weariness 
is much affected with its seeming beauty 
excellency 
or profit 
and though he generally suppress and smother all subordinate thoughts 
tending any way to the satisfying of the flesh 
yet herein is his deceit 
that he intends onely the curbing of some present 
for the injoying of the maine idoll of pleasure or profit which he aimes at 
that his thoughts being now restrained in a lesser evill 
he may have more liberty to prosecute his darling delight 
and so when he hath obtained his desire 
then the former watch is discharged 
with the regenerate it is much better 
for though they cannot set their minds upon spirituall things as they desire and pray 
yet they labour to make their heart a gracious receptacle of holiest thoughts 
they covenant to entertain the good2 chro 
2918 
they watch to prevent evill cogitations 
and they are proceeded to a constant resolution to follow after the best things 
fourthly 
if the unsound christian be touched with thoughts of remorse leading to repentance for his earthly-mindedness 
voluptuousness 
or indulgence to his bosome sinne 
he slights the matter over 
suffers them to die with the time 
and after a space returns afresh to his former course 
which in truth he never abandoned 
but the true christian worketh his heart to a serious detestation of former sinnes 
and setled purpose never to look to them any more 
if satan by renewing thoughts of it 
seek to re-enter 
he doth wisely turn his thoughts to prevent re-entry 
calling to mind what bitterness it hath cost 
what trouble it caused 
how mercifull god was in his former deliverance 
how unthankfull he should shew himself in returning to sinne again 
and into what anguish and sorrow he should plunge himself 
this is certain 
the thoughts reviving former sinnes 
breed in him more humility 
more fear 
more watchfulness against new surprisals 
a daily renouncing of himself 
and relying upon god for strength and grace to resist the temptation
q 
let us somewhat more distinctly open and look into this point 
for it is a matter of great importance
a 
more fully to open this matter 
it must be remembred that all christians are not of one stature

the state of a godly man is not alwaies one and the same 
sometimes they are carried into the mount to behold christ his glory 
at another time they are tossed with waves and winds 
as a ship ready to sink 
now they are rapt up with paul into the paradise of god 
to see things that cannot be uttered 
but by and by they are buffeted by the messenger of satan 
they have their alterations and changes 
calmes and stormes 
peace and troubles 
combats and conquests 
all these things must be considered distinctly 
that we may see what are the cogitations of the godly 
and about what things the divers sorts or degrees of them have their minds chiefly taken up 
and how they are imploied in their severall tryals
q 
whom do you call fathers
a 
fathers are such christians 
who through long experience and much acquaintance with the practice of a godly life 
have obtained grace of god to walke more constantly 
cheerfully 
fruitfully in the pathes of christianity then others 
who through long custome have had their wits exercised to discerne good and evill 
and by daily paines and travels have brought their hearts into a good and heavenly temper 
who have accustomed their minds to an heavenly course 
and by constancy in well-doing have wrought their souls to delight in obedience as most perfect liberty 
these 
in comparison of other weak christiansphil 315 
phil 
312 
are termed in scripture perfect 
though they be not come to compleat growth
q 
how are these christians differenced in their thoughts from all men unregenerate
a 
first 
they have learned to confine their thoughts to a feeling meditation of god 
his word 
or works 
the wise managing of the affaires of this life 
and the lawfull and right ordering of recreations 
they are not flitting off and on 
dreaming of earthly felicity and outward peace 
nor prophanely busied about vaine and transitory pleasures 
as if they knew no better good things to bring delight 
but usually their minds are set upon some one or other of those good instructions 
which they have gathered out of the book of god 
and safely treasured up in their hearts 
their particular discourses 
who can reckon up 
they spend many thoughts in meditation upon heavenly matters 
as the infinite majesty of god 
his everlasting being 
power 
wisdom 
goodness 
mercy 
long-suffering 
his works of nature and grace 
mercy and judgment 
how he spareth men that provoke him daily 
executeth his wrath upon the wicked 
correcteth his children for their amendment 
and pulleth men from their delights by the power of his word and spirit 
from which sometimes they could not be drawn 
also they have their minds occupied with the consideration of the shortness 
sinfulness 
and misery of this life 
the certainty of death 
with the uncertainty of the time and manner of it 
the blessed estate of the elect and faithfull 
and the cursed estate of the reprobate and unbelievers 
both of them beginning in this life 
but perfected and continued for ever in the life to come 
again 
they are taken up in consideration of their own estate 
and the severall parts of their lives 
how they might keep on constantly in their way 
not being turned aside 
what hinderances they shall finde from satan 
the world and the flesh 
how they might resist the occasions of evill 
defeat the policies of the devill 
and keep on the armour of a christian 
how they might spend well every part of the day 
give to every man his due 
carry themselves in all companies and estates 
and go through the duties of their calling so as to be furthered thereby in holiness 
when god calleth them to the practice of their vocations 
they busie their minds thereupon 
as lawfully they may 
but they suffer not the world to unsettle or distract them 
to withdraw their hearts from the love of god or goodness 
so that their worldly businesses being finished 
they can freely 
contentedly 
constantly fix their thoughts upon some mystery of godliness 
as
christ his sufferings 
the covenant of grace 
the momentany state of this life 
the joys of heaven 
and such like 
in a word 
they take thought every day they rise 
how they may have alwaies a clear conscience towards god and towards men 
how they may order well their particular actions throughout the day 
that they may make a good account to god at night 
and how they may be prepared for the cross to beare it patiently 
and profit by it 
and so be made fitter and readier to meet the lord at the last day 
and give up a comfortable account of their stewardship and talents to him 
from whom they have received them 
and no marvell 
for god hath promised to enable his servants thus to do 
if they seek it at his hands 
the man that binds the commandements continually upon his heart 
and ties them about his neckprov

such as have been of long acquaintance with the lord 
and merry because they knew themselves to be beloved of him 
have better pleasures and delights in store 
they have laboured much to cleanse the sty of sinne 
and empty out that puddle water 
they have arrested 
condemned 
judged their vaine 
and idle thoughts 
their emptiness and barrenness in good meditations 
they set diligent watch before the door of their heart to prevent the return of such unwelcome guests 
or to espy them presently 
if they make re-entry 
for experience hath taught them what an hinderance it is to have their hearts disordered with vanities 
how it deads their prayers 
slackes their proceedings in godliness 
disquieteth the comely frame of the soul which they attained with much paines 
and cannot repaire 
if once it be unsetled 
without great industry and labour 
moreover 
they have hoarded up provision and treasure 
which they bring forth as occasion is offered 
they discerne what is good 
and have their hearts at command to follow and affect the direction of sound reason 
they have tasted and fed upon the sweetness of gods promises 
and cannot savour now the white of an egge

can they that fervently long

can they do less then in spirit to ascend up into heaven 
and by faith and meditation to commune with him whom they cannot see face to face 
nevertheless 
we must not think that this worthy christian is altogether freed from evill 
unprofitable imaginations 
their thoughts and desires are 
not as they would 
but in great part vaine 
yea oft rebellious 
and such as they would not 
for their graces are weak 
their actions mixed with corruption 
and their cogitations savour of the flesh that abideth in them 
the apostle himself 
a man preferred before others 
as in calling and sufferings 
so in the graces of the spirit 
saith of himself 
that the messenger of satan was sent to buffet him 
but of this in its proper place 
secondly 
these christians are upright in their spirituall debatements of faith or practice concerning matters to believed or done 
in all humility they consider what the lord saith 
and submit their wisdom and will to the pleasure of his will 
thy look not aside at hope of credit 
pleasure 
preferrment 
friendship 
greatness or gaine 
but aime simply at the knowledge of the truth 
the glory of god 
and maintenance of every good cause 
they think not partially in their own cause 
will not be blind in the matter that concerns
their friend 
are not transported in passion to surmise evill without ground 
but follow judgment 
equity and truth 
they are not so wedded to their opinions 
as willfully to persist therein when they be convinced of errour 
nor slavishly addicted to the course of the times to conform unto them without judgment 
they embrace truth for its own sake 
and are contented to be smitten 
so they be instructed 
3 
the state of unregeneration is utterly unacquainted with those thoughts of pure joy 
heavenly consolation 
spirituall ravishment 
astonishment unspeakable and glorious 
that this child of god doth feelheb 
65 
the temporary may tast of the good word of god 
and of the powers of the world to come 
but this is not comparable to the joy of the godly for measure or continuance 
he may sip the waters of comfort 
but drinketh not soundly 
the living springs of waters 
the fountain and root of comfort 
abide not in him 
he is partaker of the spirit in a sort 
but the spirit of adoption 
the inspirer of all sound and endless comfort 
dwelleth not in him 
as it doth in every true christian 
therefore his joy withereth and drieth up 
whereas the joy of the upright is abundant and permanent 
flowing still more and more 
after some serious renovation of repentance with fresh sighes and grones 
or some speciall and set humiliation for sinne 
or some generall calamity imminent or lying upon the church 
after some effectuall ferventness in prayer 
or an entire gracious sanctification of the sabbath 
upon some strange imputation of fiery tongues 
when the innocent heart retyring into it self 
findes no cause of such false and cruell imputation 
but the defence of gods truth and profession of holiness 
or when the malice of the wicked hath so farre proceeded 
as to compass and enclose the poor soul 
that it seeth no way to escape 
or when it pleaseth god to call forth his children to beare witness of his truth 
and to seale their profession with loss of goods 
liberty 
or life 
in such like cas how wonderfully and unutterably shall sound-hearted christians 
that have formerly felt the burden of sinne 
and passed the pangs of the new-birth 
finde themselves to be cleared and refreshed 
when they blow up the coales of the spirit 
and by meditation 
examination and supplication 
conscionably stirre up the gifts that god hath given them 
when they weigh and consider afresh the promises that are made to such as confess their sinnes with hatred and shame 
and in truth of heart cleave unto the testimonies of god 
do they not sometimes 
when much molested with wrongs and injuries from men 
feel such a sensible tast of everlasting pleasures as passeth understanding 
as if they had one foot in heaven already 
and no marvell 
for an heart seasoned with grace is heaven it self 
god and christ by his blessed spirit dwelling in it 
whereby it is lifted up above it self in joy and comfortpsal

what else can be the issues of the spirit and comforter 
let david speak 
a man as deeply dejected as ever any 
what psalme of complaint almost doth he make 
that ends not in thansgiving 
now he lamenteth as though quite cast out of mind 
anon he rejoyceth as having forgotten his afflictions 
the parched 
thirsty 
and tormented soul 
that is full of fear and dread 
contrition and sorrow for sinne committed 
is not farre from this joy indeed 
though he be in sense 
for the lord hath promised to ease the laden 
refresh the weary 
and help the needy 
as for the temporary believer 
he may travell in the deepest points of learning 
busie his mind in the weightiest affairs of kingdoms and states 
give some entertainment to the promises of grace 
think in a sort upon the happiness of the saints with joy 
cast some glances upon that which is truly and spiritually good 
but his consultations are not upright 
scarse universall at any time 
he frames his cogitationes according to the current of the times 
and follows that opinion which stands best with his particular aimes 
and his joy in the lord is in nature answerable to his affection to the best things 
slight and superficiall 
4 
the seasonableness of these christian mens cogitations will make an apparent difference betwixt them and all others that are not led by the
sanctifying spirit of grace 
an exact constitution is discerned by the activity and nimbleness of the senses 
their life and vigour to apprehend their objects 
their quickness to be offended or sensibly delighted with their antipathy or convenience 
and the spirituall temper or disposition of soul is evidenced and made apparent by the promptness of the thoughts 
apt and ready to apply themselves to the states and conditions of times and seasons 
according to the diversity of occasions 
the best heart is most softened with the dew of grace 
most apt to receive the stamp and impression of the word 
most ready to be moved according to the severall occurrences that fall out and happen at home or abroad 
now these strong and wel-experienced christians have sought by all meanes to bring 
and by the mercy of go have obtained grace to bring their hearts into good plight and order 
whereby they are enabled to change and alter their cogitations 
as doth best suit with occasions 
when god calleth to sackcloth and ashes 
to weeping and lamentation 
then they apply that part of the word which is meetest to provoke to humiliation and mourning 
and fasten their thoughts upon some judgments which may further to penitency 
when god promiseth mercy 
offers peace 
enriches his church with manifold spirituall blessings 
their eyes are open to behold his goodness 
and their hearts enlarged in thankfulness 
when religion spreadeth 
the godly prosper 
the saints encrease 
the gospel hath free passage 
and comely order is observed in the assembly and amongst the members of the church 
then they are clothed with garments of gladness 
but if prophaneness be countenanced 
religion disgraced 
godliness decay 
the freedome of the gospel interrupted 
good order neglected 
and the saints had in contempt 
then they put on the weeds of sorrow 
and make lamentation in secret 
if god give prosperity 
they call for knowledge 
seek increase of faith 
patience 
peace 
and comfort 
rouse up themselves to watchfulness 
humility 
and care to take the present opportunity 
lest when it be to late they repent their folly 
if god send adversity 
they examine their waies 
acknowledge their wretched and miserable condition 
call to remembrance the sweet promises of mercy 
look to the providence of god 
consider that the end of all chastisements are peace to the godly 
and thus seeking greater assurance of forgiveness of sinnes 
power of grace 
peace of conscience 
and evidence of eternall happiness 
they quietly yeeld themselves in these outward things to the good-will and pleasure of god 
the like may be said of other particulars 
for god hath given them wisdom to see what advantages are offered for the enriching of his soul 
what course is to be taken for the encrease of his spirituall stock 
what impediments lie in the way 
how they are to be removed 
and what meditations are fittest to procure good 
and to preserve themselves from the contrary danger 
have the thoughts of a temporary believer their changes 
their severall seasons and successions 
surely they alter as his outward condition of life doth 
for upon it they are most constantly and contentedly setled 
as the world doth fawne or frown upon him 
so is he moved either with joy or sorrow 
spirituall objects if they touch not his temporalities 
make no deep impression in his heart 
take not up much room in his thoughts 
let god bless or blast a kingdom 
let the word runne swiftly or finde great opposition 
let sincerity be cast to the wals and prophaneness countenanced 
he matters not greatly 
so he may sleep in a whole skin 
and keep his worldly comforts entire 
this is that which gives life to his thoughts 
if this faile 
his thoughts are heavy 
dumpish and desperate 
well may he conform and confort with others in words 
gestures and actions 
but ordinarily his thoughts admit no change 
save onely so farre as his private temporall felicity is endangered by publique judgment 
or enlarged by showers of mercy and blessings from heaven 
unless the flourishing of religion cause secret grutching out of fear lest anothers credit should be his disgrace

great is the wisdom and dexterity that god hath given these christians
both to guard their hearts and governe their thoughts with good success for the attainment of that end they aime at 
though not in that measure they would and do desire 
their care is to prevent former evils 
and to be quickned in holiness and comfort 
which they feel in some measure 
comparing their present state with what it was in former times 
experience hath made them wise to make choice of the right way 
and to decline the rocks upon which they dained heretofore 
by long travell they have found out where they struck awry 
what hath kept them under 
how they may lead their lives with more fruit 
and make better use of gods ordinances 
in arts and trades men obtain greater skill and ripeness by paines and observation 
they bring matters to more perfection 
and dispatch their business with more speed and facility 
and shall a christian gaine nothing in godliness by long practice 
heedfull observation 
and continuall watchfulness 
their wisdom and dexterity is apparent in these things 
first 
by spirituall prudence and holy watchfulness they timely discover and defeate all be policies and stratagems of satan2 cor 2 11 
the blowes and soyles received 
have made them both skilfull and wary to espie and disapoint the assaults of the enemy 
so that they are neither turned out of the way 
nor kept under by them as heretofore 
but on the contrary are much quickned and emboldned to renew their faith 
repentance 
humiliation 
watchfulness 
so fearing danger 
that they decline it wisely 
for god in his unspeakable wisdom confounds satan in all his enterprises 
ordering the works of the devill to the setting forth of his glory 
and this secret the lord hath revealed unto his children 
whom he enableth to get good by all the assaults of that evill one 
that what satan intends for hindrance 
that makes them runne more swiftly in the right way 
doth he tempt to pride after humiliation 
they look into the imperfection of their best duties 
and are more abased 
doth he tempt to repine 
they are stirred up to love 
temptations to rashness make them moderate 
melancholy distractions draw them to sorrow more unfeignedly for their sinnes 
suggestions to remisness kindle zeal 
discouragments beget boldness and courage 
and in a word every onset provoks to earnest prayer 
secondly 
in respect of sinnes past 
or present infirmities 
they guide their thoughts so 
that they are neither plunged into honour 
nor defiled with the delightfull and pleasing remembrance of them 
a rare and speciall point of prudence 
the sinnes of our ignorance and unregeneracy leave such a staine behind them 
that after repentance men are apt to defile themselves again in their thoughts 
by running over the passages and circumstances of them with pleasure and delight 
yea 
whiles men set themselves to muse upon their sins in solitariness 
with an intent to work the heart to deeper loathing 
and unfeigned humiliation for them 
it may come to pass that their hearts may be ensnared with the love and liking of some corruption 
which they did desire most of all to abhorre 
happy then is he 
who hath obtained that faith and grace to look back upon his sinnes without horrour or defilement 
but not without sorrow and detestation 
happy is that christian 
who can pick out such a time to meditate and pray against his sinne 
that he may be comforted in hope of pardon 
provoked afresh to mourn 
and have his transgressions in greater hatred 
it is no small measure of grace that doth alter and change us 
that we should eagerly persue unto death 
what we loved better then our lives 
thirdly 
they endeavour with good success to keep out or keep down those vaine and wandering wishes that come from corruption 
for if they be permitted to kindle in their breasts 
as they know right well 
they will quickly fire the whole house 
they have learned that sins 
as diseases 
grow by continuance 
and that in spirituall 
as in bodily sicknesses 
it is good to prevent the beginnings 
they are well acquainted with the deceitfulness of their hearts 
the malice of satan 
and the circumventions of sinne 
which once entred is not easily expelled 
all which considerations awaken them 
by faith 
prayer 
meditation 
religious emploiments 
and all holy meanes 
to
beat down the body of sinne 
and where they finde themselves more subject to one sinne then to another 
it is their especiall care to curb their thoughts concerning it 
and where they finde themselves defective in one grace more then another 
they think most upon that they want most 
labouring to enlarge their hearts in love to all gods commandements 
fourthly 
they give joyfull and thankful entertainment to the good motions of gods spirit 
nourishing them with care and diligence that they may fire their hearts 
and drie up the unsavoury puddle of corruption by little and little 
and whereas it is then best to enlarge the mind in holy thoughts and meditations 
when it is freest from hinderance 
either abroad or at home 
therefore they seek and take the fittest opportunities for contemplation by night or day 
and lest that noble power of the soul should be taken up with trifles and vanity 
feed upon the earth 
or wear and waste it self with barren and lumpish melancholy 
they are carefull and provident to gather 
digest and treasure up store of good matter and heavenly businesses for the continuall exercise of their minds 
lastly 
the speciall wisdom of these worthy christians in governing their thoughts 
appeares in this 
that they fit and prepare themselves to undergo all changes without fretting 
couragiously to break through all oppositions that be made against their godly coursejob 
324 
25 
and religiously to carry themselves in all estates and employments 
that they be not idle nor unprofitable 
much more that they be not stained with the ordinary and common sinnes of the world 
in the issue of their thoughts the strong christian is differenced from the temporary 
but that comes to be considered in the state of a christian being in temptation 
and is common to him with other christians 
therefore that shall be deferred to the proper place 
and to shut up this point 
let it be observed 
that what is spoken of the thoughts of the strong christian 
that in some measure and degree may be applied to others also 
though they be not so apparent in them 
who have not long had their wits exercised to discerne good and evill 
and obtained grace to lead their life more constantly and setledly in the practice of godliness then others 
that have not so known the lord 
and the manner of his dealing with his people
q 
whom call you young men in christianity
a 
such believers as have felt comfort in christ 
tasted of the good word of god 
and been trained up in godliness 
but have not attained that strength of grace and comfort 
nor that experience in the christian combate and waies of peace 
that the old and well experienced souldiers of jesus christ have gotten 
they are a middle sort of christians 
neither so well setled 
nor so well experienced in the spirituall war fare 
nor having so much superiority over their affections 
as the fathers 
nor yet being so weak 
infirme 
and unexperienced as the babes 
these men having been nurtured up in the practice of holiness for a season 
and now called to a more serious consideration of their state and waies 
are specially busied in fighting against the temptations of satan 
resisting and subduing their unruly lusts 
of which nevertheless they are sometimes overcome 
this life is full of conflicts 
unsetledness 
and some discomfort 
now the heart is quiet 
shortly distempered with inward suggestions and outward occasions 
their continuall work is to make war against their rebellious desires 
vaine wishes 
and inordinate passions 
which making strong head against the power of grace 
do put them to no small trouble 
the apostle warneth hereof1 joh 
214 
and shewing with whom they must encounter 
encourageth to the combate 
not only telling what a glorious victory it shall be to vanquish such an enemy 
but assuring them of victory 
as if they had gotten it already 
and though this life may seem tedious and miserable 
yet is it safe and comfortable 
the life which is not exercised in this warfare 
is a life of great woe and deadly dangers
q 
how are their minds occupied
a 
in watching over their hearts to avoid sinne and the occasions thereof 
lest they should be enticed 
and so disquieted in their minds 
and break out to the offence of their brethren 
and reproach of their profession amongst the bad 
they grow wary 
weary and ashamed of anger 
impatience 
frowardness 
fretting 
sensible desiring of their neighbours goods 
&ampc 
which were wont to be common matters with them 
but now they pray more often and earnestly against them 
and have some fear both alone and in company to be overtaken by such passions 
but though they covenant to look better to their courses 
yet are they soon unsetled and distempered with unruly affections 
as in prosperity with forgetfulness of their fervent care which they had 
in the works of their callings with earthly-mindedness 
discontent 
and which they much mislike in themselves 
when they come to the sight of it 
in a word 
they are much grieved for their sinnes 
they heartily purpose and endeavour reformation 
they watch against the occasions of sinne 
they renew their covenant if they have offended 
and yet they are oft foyled 
and though they have not the like measure of spirituall strength as the fathers have 
to be exercised so constantly about heavenly things 
and to make god their guide so seriously 
yet they are much delighted with the good examples of such as go before them and give them light 
though for want of knowledge and experience they cannot proceed in godliness 
like to the well-experienced 
but are oft kept under 
foyled 
and turned out of the way 
yet they are glad of all meanes publique and private 
whereby they might be established 
in a word 
they are encumbred with many vaine 
loose and roving imaginations 
which unprofitably take up the heart 
and they fall into dreames of earthly dignities 
outward pompe 
long life 
riches 
preferment 
pleasure 
vaine wishing of that which others have 
misliking that which is their ownmat 
2020 
&ampc 
as the disciples admired the glory of the temple 
and foolishly contended amongst themselves which of them should be the greatest 
but as they come to the knowledge of these corruptions 
they complain of them 
they labour earnestly to reform and amend them 
though they be kept under long for their good 
that they might see what they are 
and be humbled in the sense of their corruption 
now from this that hath been said 
it is easie to discerne what are the cogitations of this young christian 
first 
he takes more notice and consideration of his manifold corruptions 
his unruly desires 
and inordinate passions 
then he did in former times 
or any unregenerate man can dopsal 
391 
and this worketh his heart to frequent and earnest prayer 
continuall watchfulness 
constant shunning all occasions of sinne 
and godly jealousie over himself 
lest he should be overtaken alone or in company 
howsoever loosness of mind and distemper of affection was not much regarded in times past 
yet now he thinks upon it with shame and confusion 
seriously intending and endeavouring speedy reformation 
but notwithstanding this unfeigned purpose 
these evils are neither at once nor easily subdued 
which gives occasion to many other cogitations 
secondly 
for as he meeteth with many difficulties in the way of christianityezek 315 
1 
he is oft discouraged and beginneth to faint 
finding much unsetledness in himself 
having received many foyles 
notwithstanding his advised purposes to serve the lord better 
but in this perplexity 
after some heaviness 
he comes to weigh and ponder with himself what promises god hath made to the thirsty 
what enouragements are given to them that strive 
what asistance he affoardeth to them that watch and pray 
whereby he is encouraged to shake off heaviness 
with security 
and to persist in seeking grace from above 
and if he be wisely instructed to live by faith 
not onely for the pardon of his daily infirmities 
but for strength of grace to walk before god in holiness and righteousnesscant 
31 
2 
this doth much quicken and comfort him 
oh 
he will wrastle mightily 
and take courage to rise again being foyled 
so long as he is supported with hope of victory 
he will never be secure nor heartless 
so long as he is assured
of the lords help 
thirdly 
this christian bethinks himself how he might provide and put on the spirituall compleat armour of god 
whereby he might be enabled to withstand and hold out against all the furious assaults of that wicked one 
he hath not learned the use 
but knoweth the need of that furniture 
which moveth him to seek it by earnest prayer 
for seeing weapons are for the war 
now he is exercised with conflicts and temptations 
he would not go unpreparedeph 
612 
13 
the apostle exhorteth believers to take unto themselves the whole armour of god 
that they be not put to the worst 
or forced in fight to turn their backs 
which direction this young man is fit to hear 
being acquainted with the malice of satan and his own infirmities 
fourthly 
his heart is not so deeply set upon worldly businesses 
nor let loose to vaine rovings as before 
but he looks to the principall 
and labours especially to have peace with god 
for he well perceives that these things do blind-fold judgment 
and poyson the will 
therefore the labour of the mind in great part is this 
to keep himself from being taken up with carnall 
excessive musing about earthly things or vanities 
seeing good meditations are not onely hindered 
but even estranged 
and for the time driven quite away 
fifthly 
he doth oft and earnestly consider the directions given out of the word how he might curb his passions 
and reform his thoughts 
that he might reap the benefit and profit of them 
as men of crasy temper willing to better their health 
are ready to hearken to any good prescription of diet or exercise 
so fareth it with this christian 
who is desirous above all things to get riddance from those evils 
that disturbe the peaceable disposition of his soul
q whom call you babes
a 
they are of two sorts 
for some are as it were in the birth 
as the apostle speaketh to the galathians 
my little childrengal 
419 
of whom i travell in birth again 
till christ be formed in you 
the other be such as hang upon the breast 
even as infants which are new borne 
whose property is to know their parents 
though they know nothing else 
and to cry after them1 joh 
214 
and to call them by their names 
though unperfectly and with a stammering tongue 
and to desire the breast whereby they are nourished1 pet 
22 
they are like to fresh and inexpert souldiers 
who have not as yet been feared in the field 
they little marke and consider how they are tempted and inticed 
many follies 
weaknesses 
and gross ignorance are in the most of them 
many deceivings of themselves 
many phantasies 
and oversights are carried about of them 
they know not the multitude of fleshly lusts 
which secretly lurk within them 
and the passions which ruled them before 
keep their hold 
and abide in great strength to their disgrace and discouragement 
there be two dangers whereinto they are subject to fall 
whereof the one is when they feele comfort 
and the other when they feele it not for whilest their comfort continueth 
the sweetness thereof doth so affect them 
that they are ready 
to the dishonour of god 
and offence of others 
to neglect their lawfull business 
as being a great let to their spirituall exercises 
and thereby fall into the snare of the devill 
grow to be idle and unprofitable 
to censure and spie faults in others 
when they want comfort they fall into heavy dumps 
and distractfulness 
fearing all was but a shadow and a dream 
because as young children that are not acquainted with the rod and frowns of the father 
they look to be set upon the lap
q about what are our thoughts occupied
a 
his favour is all in all unto them 
in so much as if they have not some knowledge that he is tenderly affected towards them 
they so long after it 
that nothing can satisfie them without it 
and about this their thoughts are chiefly occupied 
after they know what it is worth 
and in the meanes of their spirituall nourishment 
which is the word of god 
and not least of all in this 
that they may not in the smallest thing offend or displease god in that which they know1 pet 
22 
and by this
that hath been said 
it may appeare that the thoughts of gods people 
even the weakest 
differ much from others 
who are unrenewed 
to whom the thought of heavenly matters is tedious 
who have no delight to think how they may be better reformed 
who will not be brought to put themselves in the weights of the sanctuary 
that is 
to try their estate by the word of god 
for the temporary believer doth never so think upon the grace of god and his favour in jesus christ 
as to preferre it simply and in comparison above all worldly contentments 
that this earth doth afford 
nor upon the word of grace 
as to receive it into an honest and good-heart 
to retain and feed upon it and every part thereof with savour and delight 
nor upon the vanity 
uncertainty 
and feebleness of worldly comforts 
as to renounce all interest in things below 
that he might obtain a more certain 
durable inheritance in heaven 
nor upon the hainousness of sinne 
deliberatly to resolve not to offend god against knowledge in any wise 
but all true believers 
even the weakest babes 
have proceeded thus farre 
who are yet unable to governe their thoughts 
and rule their passions in any good manner 
know not the frowardness of their own hearts 
nevertheless 
these weak christians must remember 
that they are compared to children 
for that they should daily grow out of childishness 
and not think that from time to time they should be borne with 
and their follies winked at in them 
therefore 
our saviour compareth the state of his church and people in the first age and beginning of itmat 
1331 
to a graine of mustard seed 
which being once rooted 
how small soever it be 
groweth forward from appearing above ground 
to be a blade 
and so to branch 
teaching his thereby 
that they should so look to go from one degree to another 
that though they did not know what was to be done of them in this their christian course 
when they first enter into it 
yet now after they have been trained up in it for a season 
and have tasted of the promise of life 
they should hasten thither through all lets which might hinder them 
and purge out 
as they come to see them 
many unbeseeming qualities and old evill customes
q 
may not these three degrees of christians in some respect fall one into another
a 
yes without question 
for the most grave father may sometime 
and in some things 
be as weak as the youngest child 
and as violently tempted as the young man 
and many of the things noted before 
are incident equally and alike to them all 
yet because it hath seemed good to the wisdom of god 
by his servant to make this distinctiongal 
18 
eph 
413 
heb 
513 
14 
we must not neglect it 
besides 
it may be confirmed by sundry testimonies and examples of holy scripture 
that some are stronger then others 
and we have particular mention of many 
who of weak became strong 
and increased as in knowledge and years 
so in faith 
courage 
zeal 
as moses

&ampc
q 
are any sort of christians altogether free from evill cogitations
psal 
393 
psal 
3122a 
not any 
though some be freed in greater measure then others 
gold hath its dross 
wine its lees 
the best soyle will beare weeds 
the most holy man doth offend in words 
in thoughts much more 
every christian is a souldier by profession 
but our warfare were at an end 
if we were freed from the remainders of sinne 
nay 
the children of god 
weak and strong 
are not onely thrust 
from their peaceable condition with evill cogitations sometimes 
but sensibly dazled also 
as men not knowing where they are 
the clearest springs may runne muddy after a storme or tempest 
low brooks swell high at a flood by the inundation of other waters 
the most exact constitution is now and then shaken with a feaver 
and the best man by suggestions and allurements may be turned out of the way for a time 
an hypocrite is good for a fit 
making fair promises which he forgetteth to make good 
and a good man may be distempered
for a fit 
lissening unto those evil motions 
which upon more narrow consideration they renounce and detest
q 
what are the causes of evill thoughts
a 
evill thoughts spring from corruption of nature 
proceed from satanjam 
114 
or be occasioned by outward objects 
as hath been said 
but we may further note some speciall causes of them in respect of our selves 
such as these 
negligence in watching over our hearts 
carelesness in meditation of good things 
formality in matters of religion 
neglect of good and holy motions of gods spirit 
idleness 
the fountain and nourse of filthy and terrible thoughts 
slight observation of the word and works of god 
which causeth barrenness 
curiosity and vaine prying into things not revealed 
but though continuall watchfulness 
may prevent evil thoughts in good measure 
yet no diligence that can be used 
will free altogether from evil motions 
because the flesh that abideth in us will lust against the spirit
q 
why doth god suffer his children to be molested with evill thoughts
a 
this he doth for divers ends 
first 
that they might learn to know themselves 
how miserable and corrupt they are by nature 
unapt to good 
prone to evill 
unable to help themselves 
or to merit any thing at his hands 
secondly 
to keep them in humility 
that they be not puffed up with the measure of grace received from him 
when they feel the fruits of corruption continually troubling and interrupting them 
thirdly2 cor 
127 
the lord leaves us to be buffeted with evill thoughts 
to prevent security 
carelesness 
and falling into gross and scandalous sinnes 
as we have often temptations to distrust 
to make us the more carefull to renew our faith 
fourthly 
the daily occurrence of evill thoughts 
our inability to avoid them 
and the continuall annoyance we have from them in our best duties 
is an excellent meanes to drive us out of our selves 
and to send us to christ for daily pardon of sinnes 
and increase of grace 
which we cannot but see to be exceeding necessary 
fifthly 
the abounding of sinne doth the more commend the rich and superabundant grace of godrom 
520 
who is pleased to continue gracious and mercifull to us notwithstanding our daily infirmities 
and to heale our stained leprous nature by degrees 
untill they be made perfect and pure from all spot
q when and what thoughts do most trouble the godly
a 
first 
what sinne we are most accustomed unto 
the thought of it will be sure most to disturb us 
and that at such times as we would set our selves to meditate upon some spirituall good thing 
or prepare and make our selves ready to walk with god secondly 
when we are about to do most good 
we are sure to be pestered and interrupted with vilest thoughts 
thirdly 
the thoughts of the godly are various 
according to their condition 
constitution 
disposition 
and growth in grace 
as in prosperity to be molested with temptations to security 
pride 
forgetfulness of god 
formality in religion 
if they be not exercised with some affliction in another kind 
in adversity to be assayled with thoughts of distrust 
impatience 
faintness 
discontent 
repining 
and such like 
the fearfull and tender hearted are beset with thoughts of dejectedness 
horrour and unbelief 
the more bold of nature with presumption and self-confidence 
&ampc 
fourthly 
vaine 
idle rovings 
and unseasonable cogitations do more trouble the children of god in the practice of good duties 
then thoughts in themselves simply evill and ungodly
q 
what course must be taken for the preventing of evill thoughts
a 
first 
if evill thoughts arise in our hearts 
we must presently make resistance against them 
humbling our souls by speedy repentance 
stirring up our selves to a further dislike of the evill 
and turning the heart to the contrary good or present duty with more fervency and devotion 
secondly 
we must
store the heart continually with good matter 
and set it on work about some thing that is honest 
pure 
and profitable 
so shall there be no room for idle thoughts 
thirdly 
inordinate boundless desires of mind are occasions of many unseasonable and evill cogitations 
which must be limited and brought into subjection 
before we can be freed from noysome thoughts about them 
labour we then to confine our desires 
and strive for contentment in our estates 
so shall we avoid a world of covetous and ambitious thoughts 
with such as accompany them 
viz 
thoughts of deceit 
flattery 
murther 
&ampc 
fourthly 
watchfulness is a meanes to keep evill out of the heart 
or to apprehend it that it cannot roost there 
to be rid from wicked imaginations 
we must make a covenant with our hearts 
and set continuall watch over them 
especially we must look narrowly to our selves in the performance of holy duties 
that unseasonable thoughts foisted into the mind 
hinder not present intention 
and draw the heart another way 
for the neglect hereof gives the lord just occasion to leave us to be buffeted with all sorts of evill thoughts 
impure and terrible 
also we must carefully look to our selves 
when we are alone 
that we let not our thoughts rove at randome 
but confine them to some certain bounds 
as the goodness of god 
his works of mercy and judgment 
&ampc 
fifthly 
it is good to remember 
that we must give account for our thoughts 
and so to reckon with our selves for them in this life 
that we may not be judged for them in the life to come 
sixthly 
we shall graciously prevent evill thoughts 
if we beheedfull to entertain the good motions of gods spirit 
to obey the checks of conscience 
to make use of gods wonderfull works 
seasoning our hearts with the meditation of them 
seventhly 
it also much availeth to make a covenant with our eyes and other senses 
keeping them from carnall objects 
to avoid wicked company 
and to turn away from all occasions of evill cogitations
q 
what are the severall kinds of evill thoughts that must be shunned
a 
first 
unseasonable disordered thoughts beside the business or duty in hand 
tending to coole intention 
or to interrupt and draw us from the present work we go about
q 
what are the speciall causes of these evill thoughts
a 
what hath been said before of the causes of all evill thoughts 
may be applied to these 
unto which these speciall causess may be added 
first 
want of preparation to holy duties 
and of intention and setling the mind upon god 
and as in his presence 
in the performance of them 
secondly 
a dissolute 
inconstant practice of holy duties 
arising from love of carnall liberty 
gross ignorant conceits of gods worship 
prejudicate opinion 
or indulgence to some speciall sinne 
may occasion roving and distracting thoughts 
seldome can we keep our hearts to what they affect not 
be not accustomed unto 
esteeme not at an high rate 
set not upon with all their might 
thirdly 
covetousness and eager desire of worldly things causeth manifold wanderings 
he cannot attend upon god 
lissen to his word 
lift up his heart to heaven 
that is fast glued to the earthezek 
3331 
32 
the worldling may sit before a preacher to hear the word 
but his heart goeth after his covetousness 
fourthly 
conceit of our ability to serve god of our selves 
may justly cause the lord to give us up to be buffeted with carnall imaginations 
that we might learn better to know our selves 
and be more humble in our own eyes 
for trusting in our sufficiency 
is it to be wondered at 
if we finde our selves disturbed in the service we take in hand 
and be made to see the vanity of our hearts 
fifthly 
ignorance and unsedledness is the cause of much slightness 
uncertainty 
and wandering 
of fear 
distraction 
and inconstancy 
when we be ever doubtfull of our course 
whether it be pleasing to god or no 
we must necessarily be tossed to and fro in our selves 
neither knowing what to do 
no leave undone 
sixthly 
the liberty of the senses in
holy duties 
as of the eye to rove 
and of the ear to wander after pleasing objects 
as pompous ceremonies 
may be occasions to cloy the heart with carnall thoughts 
seventhly 
the heart is to seek in holy duties 
because we suffer it to wander all the day long
q 
what be the unseasonable thoughts that molest the godly in good duties
a 
they be of divers kinds 
some in themselves good and profitable 
but not sorting with the present occasion 
nor leading us along therein 
some in themselves lawfull 
if they had been recalled in their season 
as of matters pertaining to this life 
arrands 
journeys 
building 
buying 
selling 
business that we had forgotten 
or have to do with some other person 
&ampc 
some triviall 
vaine 
idle and sottish 
of things of no worth 
or that shall never come to pass 
to say nothing of thoughts evill in themselves 
carnall 
presumptuous 
vaine-glorious 
filthy 
curious 
&ampc 
which do grievously trouble the heart in the performance of that service 
wherein he desires to enjoy most sweet communion and fellowship with god 
these latter are not onely unseasonable 
but sinfull in themselves 
therefore i will reserve them to their proper place
q 
what are the effects of these thoughts
a 
first 
at the best they interrupt the intention of heart in the worship of god 
and so hinder the work of the spirit in the power thereof 
and deprive the conscience of much comfort 
secondly 
if we give way unto them they may prove occasions of hypocrisie 
formality in religion 
prophaneness of heart 
nay they may procure some spirituall desertion 
and move the lord to give us up to the reproach of some gross sinne 
to punish our disregard of his glory 
thirdly 
scrupulousness is caused by vaine thoughts 
is not this a tentation incident to many weak ones in the day of their desertions 
that they dare not meddle with the ordinances of god 
their hearts are so full of ignorance and vanity 
they have so abused them heretofore 
and their minds are so choaked with vanity and abhomination 
that they are afraid to come before god 
lest they should be found guilty of taking his name in vaine 
but against this 
it must be remembred 
that the sinne which cleaveth to us 
cannot excuse the omission of a duty that god requireth 
the vanity that disturbes must be laboured against 
but the duty which god necessarily requires 
must not be neglected
q 
why doth the lord suffer his servants to be pestered with unseasonable thoughts in his service
a 
satan intends the molestation of the saints and the dishonour of god 
by stirring up such idle imaginations in their minds at that time 
but the lord in great wisdom orders all things to the good of his people and the confusion of satan 
first 
hereby the lord doth tame the pride of our hearts 
and keep us in humility 
discovering to us the sinfull vanity that doth possesse the soul 
and our averseness to that which is good 
oh 
what wretchedness doth lodge in the heart 
that men should delight more to busie themselves vainely 
then to commune with the lord 
secondly 
the grace of god is the more glorious 
in that he doth enable us to pray 
and accept of our prayers 
the vanity of our thoughts sufficiently testifies what our hearts by nature do affect and runne after 
if they be lifted up in any measure to desire spirituall things 
it is by the powerfull work of grace 
the imperfection of our prayers is manifest by our rovings 
that we must acknowledge it the great mercy of god 
if he vouchsafe audience or grant our requests 
what hath been said before of the causes why god suffers his children to be troubled with evill cogitations 
may be applied to these in speciall
q what are the remedies of these thoughts
a 
first 
to wake with god in the morning 
is a speciall preservative against idle wanderings in holy duties 
if the eye be lightsome to see god in christ 
through the glass of the word 
and to hol waking before him 
if the affections be moved to him in thankfulness 
who hath led us all our daies 
who is that prince that maketh peace in us 
whose secret is the strength of our heart that it fainteth not 
whose favour is that shield which doth so cover us 
that evils have not leave to assaile us 
much less to prevaile against us 
if we fly to christ early to have the dimness of our sight cleared 
to get the distillation of by-thoughts stopped 
by looking to him who unites our hearts to himself 
if we seek to that quickning spirit to scatter our slumber 
and labour him who is light it self to expell those externall darknesses which inviron us 
if we look to jesus christ who is made of god our righteousness and sanctification 
to wash away the guilt of sinne 
and by his spirit to cleanse us from the spot of corruption 
if we put on christ by faith 
and gird about us the compleat armour of a christian 
if we look to christ by faith as our salvation 
who must bring all our graces forward from one degree to another 
as to our vice-roy 
who must tread satan under our feet 
as to our guide and directour who must lead us forward in the waies of peace 
if we learn thus to awake with god every morning 
and prepare our selves to walk with him 
we shall the better be fenced against unseasonable thoughts all the day after 
secondly 
holy preparation to good duties is profitable against idle thoughts 
did we set our selves to the consideration of our inability and unworthiness to appeare before god 
to the meditation of his majesty and holiness with whom we have to do 
to the thought of our manifold wants 
and the sweet comfort we might have in communion with god 
we should not be distracted as many times we are 
it is our rushing upon holy things without deliberation 
that causeth so many by-thoughts in the performance of our best services 
thirdly 
in the practice of all spirituall exercises we must especially look to the intention of the heart 
setling it in the presence of the great and all-seeing god 
and fixing it constantly upon him alone 
fourthly 
constancy in keeping our times and occasions for holy duties is a great furtherance of intention 
neglect breeds unfitness 
discontinuance causeth distraction 
if the nest of wandering imaginations be not purged by constant resistance 
they will encrease more and more 
the less communion we have with god 
the more untoward are our hearts to come before him 
fifthly 
the daily renewing of repentance for all known sinne 
doth embolden to appear before the lord in his worship 
and fit to free and entire conversing with his majesty 
for the heart that is purged and made clean 
is not haunted with the thought of sinne 
when we are about the most excellent works 
as it would be if sinne were suffered to have quiet harbour 
sixthly 
we must make a covenant with our senses 
as with our ears and eyes 
&ampc 
that in the worship of god they may not wander after vanity 
and so let in such objects as may divert and corrupt our serious meditations 
seventhly 
the confining of our thoughts and affections in worldly occasions all the day long 
is a speciall meanes to prevent vaine rovings 
when we intend spirituall duties 
if our conversation be without covetousness 
discontent 
distrust 
lightness 
if we prosecute our civill affaires with heavenly minds 
undertaking them in obedience 
depending upon his goodness for success 
submitting our selves to his good pleasure 
aiming at his glory 
resting in his approbation 
if we be frequent in meditation of heavenly things 
and draw our selves into gods presence to have private familiarity with his holiness 
if we observe our hearts 
that they runne not loosely up and down we know not whither 
and take notice of our wants 
that we might seek supply 
then shall the heart be more ready and spirituall when we come to set duties 
eighthly 
if we cannot get freedom from vaine imaginations 
yet may we not omit the practice of good duties 
for that were to give
way to the corruption of nature and malice of satan 
therefore casting away all confidence in our selves 
and calling to remembrance the mercifull promises of god to pardon the weaknesses that cleave unto our best duties 
we must still draw near unto the throne of grace 
complaining unto our god of the unruliness of our hearts 
and labouring to approve them in his presence 
waiting upon him for the accomplishment of his work 
and comforting our selves in the promise of his rich 
free 
undeserved mercy 
thus if we humble our selves 
and prepare our heart to meet the lord 
we shall finde the lord gracious 
both to grant pardon 
and to vouchsafe freedom from these vaine and wandering imaginations 
lastly 
if we be distracted with buzzing thoughts in time of prayer or such like 
we must not turn our imaginations upon the temptation 
and discourse with it 
though it be to work the heart to a detestation of such vanity 
for by that meanes the heart shall be drawn aside from the present duty 
and more distracted 
but humbling our selves and checking our sloth in that spirituall work 
we must set all the powers of soul with more life 
vigour 
and attention about the business under our hands 
as the corruption of our hearts seconded with the malice of satan shall labour our unsetling 
let us contend by the power of the spirit to fix our thoughts upon god before whom we stand
chap 
v 
of a second sort of evil thoughts 
viz 
vain and roving cogitations 
the effects or consequences of such thoughts 
with the course to be taken for the prevention thereof 
wherein is a large digression about meditation 
shewing how it may be raised both from the works and word of god 
from the book of the creature 
and of the scriptures
question 
what are a second sort of evil thoughts that must be avoided
a 
idle and vain rovings 
with excessive thoughts touching the profits and pleasures of this life 
which draw the heart from god 
and disturb that sweet and heavenly disposition of soul which ought to be in us
q 
what are the effects of these thoughts
a 
first 
they hinder much sweet communion with god 
and cause the mispending of much good precious time 
with the omission of sundry occasions whereby we might enrich our selves with grace and comfort 
secondly 
they disturb peace of conscience 
and disorder the heart when it should enjoy most entite fellowship with god in christ 
for let the heart runne loose all day 
and it will not stand at command in the evening to waite upon god 
thirdly 
they coole the heat of the spirit and pollute the heart with evil 
as they come from corruption 
so they encrease and strengthen inward corruption 
like weeds that fat and make rank the soul to bring forth bad fruit in more abundance 
fourthly 
idle thoughts expose the heart to manifold temptations 
sinne may enter and finde room with more ease 
when the door is held open for it by idleness and roving
q 
is it not a thing impossible to bring all our thoughts into subjection
and a bootless labour to attempt any such thing
a 
we must not look to be free from idle thoughts so long as we carry about with us this body of sinne 
but as by the grace of god 
being of our selves unable to do any thing 
we may do all things 
so farre forth as shall further us to happiness 
so by the gracious assistance of his spirit 
we shall prevaile so far in the government of our thoughts 
as to entertain occasions for the quickning and well disposing of them 
to avoid the contrary 
to be humbled for our by-thoughts 
and to be drawn nearer unto god in spirituall worship 
therefore to labour against vaine imaginations is no vaine task 
for by diligent and constant endeavour 
we shall dissolve the troops that did assault 
and gaine freedom in measure 
though farre from perfection 
and say we did prevaile nothing for a time 
by that holy contention we shall approve our hearts to god 
that we allow not the evill 
which doth molest continually
q what course may be taken to prevent these roving imaginations
a 
first 
it is to be remembred that we may lawfully set our thoughts upon the businesses of this life 
when the lord calleth unto them 
for the labours of our vocation are the works of god 
wherein he hath ordained us to walk 
which being followed with moderation in obedience to his commandement 
do not separate the heart from him 
but unite it closer unto him 
and even whiles the mind is holily employed about the things of this world 
it is virtually lifted up to god and looketh towards him 
this caveat is here added 
lest scrupulous consciences should needlesly afflict themselves 
as if it were an argument of earthly-mindedness in lawfull manner to mind the duties of their place 
or that their case was evill 
because they did not constantly set their thoughts upon things above 
when they were exercised about the affaires of this life 
secondly 
cast thy business so that god may have his times every day set out unto him 
and our own imploiments and occasions 
their shares and portions allotted them conveniently 
and what time shall be set apart for divine duties 
let it be observed constantly 
as much as may be 
yet without superstition 
but withall look unto it 
that the constant allowance for good duties 
be neither niggardly 
nor unseasonable 
nor slightly passed over 
as if the least care were sufficient 
where the greatest is too little 
nor must we rest in the daily portion 
when necessity or opportunity require or afford more liberality 
thirdly 
the heart must be well stored with good matter 
whereupon it may exercise it self as occasion is offeredhe must let great purchases alone 
that hath nothing to disburse 
and that we might with more readiness recall to mind what is treasured up in memory 
and know what is fit to be thought upon 
it is good to digest it into order and methode 
that each thing may offer it self at convenient time 
and we be not to seek what to do 
when we have opportunity to be doing good 
as to make choice of some thing to be thought upon in the morning 
that is fit to season the heart all the day after 
viz 
how we are to hold communion with god 
and prepare our selves to walk before him that day without offence 
what thankfulness we owe unto him for the comforts of the night 
and how to preserve our faith in christ touching all the promises of grace made in the word 
and for the rest of the day 
it is good sometimes to think of our manifold wants and infirmities 
the haniousness of sinne 
the benefit of justification 
the royalty of adoption 
the power of grace 
the practice of repentance 
the priviledges of a godly life 
the power 
truth 
mercy 
unchangeableness of god 
and such like 
and that in such order as we have proposed to our selves for many times we know not about what to busie our thoughts 
and so give way to idleness 
because what we have learned 
is not ranged into any methode 
before we enter upon the performance of holy duties 
as prayer 
praise 
&ampc 
let us not be negligent to fasten our cogitations upon somewhat that might quicken devotion 
zeal 
reverence and attention 
as to consider what we are 
with whom we have to deale 
what wants do oppress us 
what liberty
we have to ask 
what promises to speed 
how we should make our petitions devotionally 
and stirre up our selves to return praise with cheerfulness 
so likewise for the works of god 
both of creation and government 
nature and grace 
the observation of them is exceeding profitable to prevent idleness 
and to further suddain and setled meditation 
now touching the works of creation 
we may observe their qualities 
use 
benefit 
and what comparisons are taken from them in the word of life
for example

of a fourth sort of evil thoughts

viz 
satanical thoughts 
why the lord suffers his children to be troubled therewith

vvhat are the fourth sort of evil thoughts that must be shunned
a 
they are such as be occasioned through the constitution or complexion of body 
or condition of life 
amongst which melancholike thoughts are principal 
which are violent and strong imaginations of mind 
arising from such parts as are especially possessed with that strong and pestilent humour 
causing strange and vehement passions 
of fear 
grief 
jealousie 
rage 
despair 
and these thoughts are divers according to the condition

naturall and renewed 
sound and wounded christians may be afflicted 
and that with divers kinds of melancholy 
and upon different occasions 
which causeth great diversity in thoughts 
and affections following them
q 
many men suppose all sorrow for sin and trouble of mind to be melancholy 
how then are they to be distinguished
a 
the better to judg aright of melancholy 
we must observe these rules 
1 
all evil thoughts proceed naturally from the corrupt fountain of our hearts 
and are not to be imputed to melancholy 
this may further them and their dwelling on our hearts 
but the ground of them is our cursed nature 
led captive by satan at his will 2 
thoughts of melancholy are suddain 
violent 
unseasonable 
vaine and idle 
without sound ground 
yea 
contrary to common reason and religion 
and yet impatient of cure 
exorbitant 
very difficult to be remedied 
but thoughts concerning sanctification arise from the true ground 
are not violent 
but deliberate 
and work kindly for the good and reformation of the heart 
if they be entertained truly 
and nourished by the spirit 
3 
melancholy is not trouble of conscience 
nor of it self 
doth it make the more subject to trouble of conscience 
but when the conscience is wounded 
it may encrease the measure and continuance of the distress 
and difficulty of the cure 
he may be wounded in conscience 
that is not annoyed with melancholy 
and he may be kept under with melancholy 
that is not distressed in conscience 
again 
distress of conscience may breed melancholy 
but melancholy can onely augment the anguish of the distressed 
not cause the distress 
these two troubles of conscience and melancholy are thus distinguished 
first 
when conscience is troubled 
the affliction it self is in the conscience 
and so in the whole man 
but in melancholy the imagination is distempered and troubled 
not the conscience 
secondly
the conscience afflicted hath a true and certain cause 
whereby it is troubled 
viz 
the sight of sinne 
and the sense of gods wrath 
but in melancholy 
the imagination conceiveth a thing to be so 
which is not so 
for it makes a man to fear and despair 
upon supposed and feigned causes 
distress of conscience is a sorrow and fear upon cause 
and that the greatest cause that worketh misery upon man 
the other contrarily a meer fancy 
and hath no ground of true and just object 
but is onely raised upon disorder of humour in the fancy 
and rashly delivered to the heart 
which upon naturall credulity fareth in passion 
as if that were indeed 
whereof the fancy giveth a false alarum 
thirdly 
upon serious and true consideration of the things feared 
and upon experience 
the fear of melancholy is known to be groundless 
frivolous and idle 
but distress of conscience encreaseth the more we look into and weigh with our selves the causes of it 
fourthly 
in trouble of conscience the body standeth oftentimes in firme state of health 
perfect in complexion 
and perfect in shape 
the humours in quantity and quality not exceeding nor wanting their naturall proportion 
here the senses also are oft-times perfect both inward and outward the imagination sound 
the heart well compact and resolute 
and this excepted 
want no courage 
in the other the complexion is depraved 
obstructions hinder the free course of spirits and humours 
the inward sense and outward be feebled 
and the heart upon every small occasion 
yea though none be 
is driven with the tide of this humour to fear 
even in the middest of security 
fifthly 
imaginations in the braine caused by melancholy 
may be cured 
taken away 
and cut off by meanes of physick 
but the distress of conscience 
cannot be cured by any meanes in the world but one 
and that is the blood of christ sprinkled upon the conscience
q 
what is the remedy of these thoughts
a 
first 
in distress of melancholy 
the person troubled must be brought to this 
that he will content himself to be advised and ruled by the judgment of others 
and cease to rest upon himself touching his own estate 
and by this he shall reap much quiet and contentation 
secondly 
if the party distressed be meerly naturall 
without all knowledge of his estate 
then meanes must be used if he be capable to bring him to some sight and sorrow for sinne 
that his melancholy sorrow 
may be turned into godly sorrow 
thirdly 
if he be brought to faith in gods mercifull promises 
and an honest purpose not to sinne any more 
then must he rest upon the word of life 
and in no wise admit any imagination or thought 
that may cross the said promise 
for what 
should erroneous and false conceits draw us to question the truth of god 
or being once resolved what is to be believed 
shall we enter into disputation about it to please fancy 
no 
we must rest in the promise we have received 
and not lissen so much to conceit 
as to admit consultation 
whether it be true or no 
fourthly 
a set calling and diligent imployment is necessary to repress melancholy 
such as may stirre up the spirits by labour 
quicken the dulness of the humour 
and take up the mind 
that it may not harbour idle cogitations 
fifthly 
cheerfulness and courage do much availe against melancholy 
when we stirre up our selves to delight in that which is good 
and raise up our spirits against dauntedness and dejectedness occasioned through erroneous 
frivolous 
false conceits engendering fear 
a melancholy christian hath gotten good victory over that humour 
when he is resolved to go forward in an holy course 
as he shall be enabled by the spirit of god 
labouring for soundness of judgment 
and tenderness of conscience 
watching over his heart 
renewing his repentance 
and preserving his faith 
not giving credit to any doubtfull imaginations or frivolous thoughts contrary to the promises he hath received 
these things principally may perswade every man to this resolution 
first 
the end of such cogitations is directly contrary to the commandement of god 
for we are charged to believe 
to be
of good courage 
to go cheerfully about the works of our calling 
to be patient 
&ampc 
but the effect of these thoughts 
if we assent unto them 
is clean cross 
shall we be afraid to do what the lord requires 
and to yeeld obedience to his precepts 
secondly 
of our selves by nature we are not prone to that which is truly good 
but these cogitations do sue upon us early and late 
with great importunacy 
thirdly 
what wise captain will fight for the victory which he hath wonne 
or set that at the stake which he hath in his power 
it is no wisdom in a christian 
upon some vaine fear 
to yeeld up his title and interest in the promises of mercy 
fourthly 
a quiet mind is fittest to apprehend the truth 
as a sound eye to behold the light of the sunne 
when the eye is dimme 
or distempered with rheumes 
we will trust others 
not our selves 
or our selves before distemper 
better then at the present 
why should we not likewise believe what we discerned when the heart was calme 
rather then what we fear when it itroubled 
fifthly 
no affection is good 
that runneth before judgment 
sound and true judgment 
till a thing be truly known as it is 
we cannot be affected to or against it 
as we ought 
but in these thoughts 
affection followeth corruption 
imagination 
and vain conjectures of deluded fancy 
sixthly 
the true use of holy society doth much further the cure of melancholy thoughts 
by mutuall conferrence 
direction and counsell quickening each other to holy duties 
comforting in the promises of grace 
and enforming how to break through the snares of satan 
seventhly 
if by reason of bodily weakness or infirmity 
a man be not able to stirre about the labours of his vocation 
he must exercise himself continually in the practice of some christian duty 
as prayer 
reading the scripture 
learning by heart some portion of the word of god 
that the mind being taken up about other matters 
these vain fancies might not find entrance 
or at least entertainment 
and though they importunately seek again and again to re-enter 
we must shut the door against them 
not giving credit to what is suggested 
lastly 
the effects of naturall melancholy 
must be made spurres unto grace 
inciting to godly sorrow for sinne 
cheerfulness in wel-doing 
retiredness from the world 
familiarity with god 
patience in troubles 
jealousie of our selves 
and confidence in god 
resting on his faithfulness 
this may be done 
if we turn vain sorrow into godly 
and frivolous fear 
into sound fear of gods presence 
majesty 
displeasure and judgments 
and scrupulousness 
into holy tenderness 
and strong erroneous resolutions into strong adherence unto the promises of life 
strong and suddain affections or thoughts seasoned by grace 
and set upon right objects 
are furtherances in godliness 
occasions of zeal and courage 
constancy and resolution 
tenderness and divine contemplation 
serious meditation and society with god
q 
what are the fift kind of evil thoughts that are to be shunned
a 
they are satanicall thoughts cast into the mind immediately by satan 
that he might distract and discourage the child of god in his holy profession and cheerfull proceeding in true godliness
q why doth the lord suffer his children to be molested with such like thoughts
a 
this the lord suffereth in great wisdom for the speciall good of his chosen 
and that both for their correction 
and triall 
sometimes we are apt to stand more upon the outward form of religion and bodily performance of holy duties 
then upon the inward devotion and strain of heart 
sometimes to grieve the good spirit of god 
sometimes to exalt our selves above that which is meet 
sometimes we give way to multitudes of roving 
idle 
and wicked thoughts without regard 
which might break into outward acts to the dishonour of god 
should he not leave us to the buffetings of satan 
to prevent the growth of sinne 
and call us back to the remembrance of our waies 
sometimes we are ready to pry into sacred and high mysteries too farre 
sometimes
to give way to thoughts of despair 
sometimes to neglect the favour of god 
and disregard his presence 
sometimes to presume upon our strength and self-sufficiency 
sometimes to censure and judg others without pitty or compassion for these and the like sins 
it may please god to give over his children to be exercised with plasphemous or self-murthering thoughts 
that they might learn to walk in humility 
keep within their compass 
fear before him 
be devout in his service 
watchfull over their thoughts 
and tender-hearted to their brethren 
for the triall of his servants also 
he suffereth them to be molested 
that their saith 
patience 
zeal 
reverence might be exercised 
approved 
and encreased
q 
seeing the same thoughts may proceed from original corruption 
how may we discerne when thoughts be suggested by satan
a 
first 
if they come suddainly 
with violence 
if we give them no entertainment with any manner of delight 
but reject the first motion with rembling and detestation
q 
may these thoughts wholly be impted to satan 
that the blame be laid upon him altogether 
and not at all upon corruption
a 
it is not safe to accuse satan 
or excuse our selves altogether 
for corruption may occasion such thoughts 
at least set open the heart to receive such temptations 
it may cause them to abide longer with us 
then otherwise they could 
and by doubtings and unbelief 
they may be stained 
in these respect 
we must charge our selves with folly 
though in these imaginations we may observe a principall hand of satan
q 
what is the remedy ef these thoughts
a 
first 
if we be unsetled in the truth of god 
touching the points wherein we are tempted 
it must be our care without delay to inform our selves out of the word of god 
resting in what is taught therein for our learning 
and not carnally to dispute with those plasphemous thoughts 
for the seeds of atheism are sown in corrupt reason 
which is not able to comprehend the high mysteries of god 
secondly 
it is good to humble our selves before god for our former irreverence 
pride 
self-confidence 
neglect of evil thoughts 
disesteem of gods promises 
carelesness to ground our selves in the main principles of religion 
and corruption of heart 
which may be the true causes why we are buffeted 
and to stirre up our hearts to greater devotion in prayer 
reverence of god 
regard of our thoughts 
esteem of his grace 
and conscience of our infirmity 
that denying our selves we might be the fitter to receive mercy 
to which must be joyned conscience of all known duties 
with contentedness in our estate 
be it more or less comfortable 
for discontent and hypocrisie 
and customariness in good duties 
do wonderously lay open the heart to such molestations 
thirdly 
having humbled our souls before god for former sinnes 
and from the heart condemned these abhominable suggestions 
we must with courage and confidence rest upon the promises of god made in christ for the pardon 
sanctification 
and removall of these temptations in due time 
satans drift is to weaken faith 
our care must be to cleave faster to the promises of life 
to prize them at an higher rate 
and above all to look that we defile not our souls with unbelief 
the aime of the devill is to drive us to despair of gods mercy 
our best meanes of resistance is with invincible resolution to stop our ears against his plasphemies 
and to cast our selves upon the promises of god 
what use soever we make of these thoughts 
let it begin in faith 
and end in assurance and expectation of good 
fourthly 
we must with cheerfulness set our selves to the practice of piety 
and works of our vocation 
not suffering the heart to conferre with temptations cast into it 
to divert and hinder us 
for it is satans policy 
by discouragment and unbelief to draw us from prayer 
reading the scripture 
and the labours of our calling 
as knowing that these are the way of peace 
and meanes
of safety 
it stands us upon greatly to take courage in the lord 
and to exercise our selves as we shall be able 
in some good and honest work 
not being dismaied with any terrours 
or driven from it with any thoughts 
but of this somewhat hath been spoken formerly more at large 
which i will not here repeat
q 
the godly are molested with evil thoughts as well as the wicked 
what then is the difference betwixt them in respect of there evil cogitations
a 
the godly are troubled with evil thoughts 
but they are not men of evil thoughts 
they give not themselves to foster and cherish such perillous guests 
the particular differences are 
first in their entertainment 
it is the property of grace not to suffer evil thoughts to rest quietly 
though it be molested with them 
and it is the property of corruption 
to quench good motions that are tendered to the heart 
as a good man useth all diligence to be rid of wicked imaginations of all sorts 
he prayeth against them 
humbleth himself 
desireth pardon for them 
and power over them 
so the wicked cherish the thought of their beloved sinne 
but slightly respect or give attendance to holy meditations 
the godly are much troubled with their evil thoughts 
as being the fountain and occasions of all sinne 
but the wicked 
either make no reckoning of them 
because they are ordinary 
or if they suit with their humour 
welcom them with joy and delight 
secondly 
they differ in regard of the issue and effects 
as that evil thoughts in the godly breed humiliation 
fear 
watchfulness 
examination of their hearts 
judging of themselves 
prayer 
longing after heaven 
&ampc 
but in the wicked they are entertained freely without resistance 
or suffered to die in time without more a do 
if they break not forth into the practice of evill 
the most comfortable and sanctified soul 
is someties overclouded with dumps of heaviness 
and inwardly disquieted with its own motions 
or the suggestions of satan 
there is not an heart so sweetly and resolutely composed for heaven 
but is sometimes dissetled with thoughts of indignation 
and that specially 
when folly is set in great excellency 
and true piety had in disgrace 
but marke the difference 
discontentfull discourses in the minds of unregenerate men 
either break out into desperate conclusions 
or be appeased by some opposite conceit of stronger worldly comforts 
abandoned by entertainment of outward mirth 
diverted by company 
pleasures 
and joyfull accidents composed by worldly wisdom 
or the like 
but heavy-hearted thoughts in gods childrenpsal 
62 
&amp 
73 
though for a while not utterly without some aspersion of distrust 
fretting and discontent 
yet commonly at length being mingled with faith 
and managed by spirituall wisdom 
by the grace of god 
break out into fairer lightnings of comfort 
greater heat of zeal 
more lively exercise of faith 
gracious speeches 
and many blessed resolutions
q 
is every good motion a sanctified thought
a 
the goodness of the thoughts is not to be measured by the suddain motion that occasionally ariseth in the heart 
but by the room wherein they are 
the entertainment we give unto them 
and the effects they produce 
if they dwell with us familiarly 
and work powerfully 
bringing forth seasonable fruits fit for the time wherein it is required 
fit for the person that doth perform it 
fit for the person to whom it is performed 
then are they sanctified indeed 
but we must hold this for an undoubted principle 
that grace is operative 
from whence it followeth 
that the judgment of our uprightness and integrity of heart 
is not to be taken so much from the simple motion to good or evil 
as from the approbation of the one 
and rejection of the other 
the simple motion to sin argues imperfection 
but the sincere rejection of evil 
and sound approbation of good 
is a testimony of truth and uprightness
q 
is it possible for a man to know all his thoughts
a 
if we consider our thoughts in generall 
it is impossible to discerne them
every one 
for to search the heart and know the infinite variety of thoughts 
belongeth to the lord alone 
but we may and ought to know our thoughts so farre 
as to approve our selves sincere and honest in his sight 
namely 
that we labour to keep an holy order in our thoughts 
that they may attend what they are imployed in 
that we watch against and reject evil imaginations 
that we cherish the good 
doing all things as in gods presence to his glory
q is it a testimony of an unsanctified heart to think more of earthly then of heavenly things
a 
1 
if the multitude of loose 
roving 
idle 
worldly and evil thoughts 
that arise in the minds of the godly be considered in themselves 
it cannot be denied but they are many more in number 
then their good cogitations 
which is an argument that much corruption abideth in the hearts of the best 
though they be not altogether unsanctified 
2 
the triall of sanctification consists not in the multitude of our thoughts either way inclined 
but in the entertainment of them 
good motions rejected 
are thereby to us unsanctified 
and evil thoughts repelled by grace 
and subdued by the spirit 
are testimonies of sanctification 
not in that they are evil 
but as they are resisted 
3 
the lord hath given more time for worldly occasions 
then he hath assigned for spirituall exercises 
but we have not liberty to loose our thoughts upon them 
for no creature of god is good 
unless it be sanctified by the word and prayer 
we are charged to use this world as though we used it not 
and the labours of this life must be undertaken in obedience 
with desire to glorifie god 
and profit our brethren 
4 
it is one thing to be employed in the world 
another to set the heart upon the things of this world 
these things wisely considered 
the resolution of the doubt is easie 
worldly 
excessive 
vaine 
idle motions do argue the heart to be corrupt 
not altogether unsanctified 
but if it be onely or principally set upon the world 
if the things of this life be onely in request 
it is unsanctified

for the god of peace will be with them to bless and comfort them

first 
the devising 
plotting or contriving of known wickedness 
is a thing odious and hatefull before god 
the wicked plotteth against the just 
wo to them that devise iniquity 
and work evil upon their beds 
sorrow and grief shall be to them that imagine mischief 
they consult shame 
misery and destruction unto themselves 
the thought of foolishness is sinne 
and transgression of gods most holy law 
and as the heart of him that deviseth wickedness is impure 
so are his words and actions abhominable in the sight of god 
the thoughts of the wicked are abhomination to the lord 
but the pure have pleasant words 
the opposition stands thus 
the thoughts of the wicked 
and therefore also their words 
are abhomination to the lord 
but the words of the pure 
and consequently their thoughts 
are pleasant unto him 
secondly 
continuing to give entertainment to wicked surmises 
and uncharitable purposes of doing evil 
is condemned by the word of truth 
the counsell of solomon is 
if thou hast thought evil 
lay thy hand upon thy mouth 
be silent 
leave off 
and give over 
for the first step to reformation is to cease from maintaining of sin 
for the lord by ezekiel doth promise it as a sound testimony of unfeigned repentance 
saying 
that thou maist remember 
and be ashamed 
and never open thy mouth any more 
and therefore job also by this argument doth make profession of his humiliation 
saying 
behold 
i am vile 
what shall i answer thee 
i will lay my hand upon my mouth 
once have i spoken 
but i will answer no more 
yea twice 
but i will proceed no further 
thirdly 
the device of evil ignorantly begun 
or in simplicity 
when that which is indeed evil was thought to be good is sinne 
and to be amended 
for ignorance of gods will 
which is of it self a sinne 
though unavoidable in some degree 
cannot excuse the errour of a device springing from an etroneous and false conceitprov 
249 
the thoughts of foolishness 
even those that are conceived in simplicity for want of better instruction 
are sinne 
therefore it much concernes good men to know not onely what is good and evil 
but amongst good things what is best 
and amongst evils 
what is worst 
and that even to the least iote and title 
fourthly 
negligent study of good is condemned also 
when men seek not opportunities to be doing what is required
q 
may not good men be drawn aside to take counsell about the doing of evil
a 
first 
in the errour of judgment they may take evil for good 
and so devise to effect what is evil 
not as an evil 
but as it appeares good in their sight 
secondly 
being transported with passion and unbridled affection 
they may
give way to wicked thoughts and reasonings 
as to purpose some kind of revenge in cross speech

when through security 
giving way to their lusts 
they are fallen from their stedfastness 
then they may devise which way to bring some ungodly purpose to pass 
or by what meanes they might satisfie their unruly desires 
thus david having fallen unadvisedly in the case of bathsheba 
doth plot and cast how he might hide and conceale his fault 
not sparing to intice ʋriah to sinne 
but this is not the deliberate or well-advised thought of a christian 
rather 
satan taking him at advantage he is driven by the power of corruption he knoweth not whither 
it is to be observed also 
that the child of god in his distemper is not himself 
for he hath soundly 
upon good advice

with a well planted resolution 
cast off the liking of all sinne 
with full purpose never to return unto it again 
and it is contrary to his former course that now he looketh with indulgence to any known evil

right reason

without which the other two cannot standesa 
820 
for whatsoever agreeth with the holy scripture rightly understood 
that is true and good 
whatsoever is contrary to the scripture rightly understood 
that is false and evil 
for 
seeing god is the first truth and goodness 
there can be no second truth and goodness 
unless it have its original from it 
and agree and consent with it

there be many false teachers 
which corrupt the simplicity of the truth 
and under feigned pretences seek to bring in damnable doctrines 
therefore we must learn to discerne and approve the right 
that we be not deceived by

both in doctrine and manners 
they may teach and do things not consenting to the words of wholesome doctrinecol 
22 
in which respect it behoveth all men to get good evidence and assurance of knowledg in their own hearts 
thirdly 
if we receive the truth upon the credit of men 
we shall be ready to stagger when persecution comes 
and be much perplexed if we see them 
of whom we learned the truth 
to shrink and fall away 
fourthly 
want of judgment causeth rash censuring 
superstitious scrupulousness 
vaine presumption 
and feigned reverence 
he that is not able to discerne betwixt good and evil 
will condemn good for evil 
and take evil for good many times 
he will be fearfull of sinne in every thing 
or bold to rush into sinne without fear 
either he will not respect the ordinances of god 
or think to please him with counterfeit humility 
fifthly 
truth the more it is tryed 
the better it doth work 
the more clear and certain apprehension we have of the promises 
the more stedfast is our faith 
the more vehement is our love 
the more sound our joy 
the more constant our hope 
the more calme our patience 
the more fiery our zeal 
the more earnest our pursuit of true happiness 
probable hopes of encreasing their temporall estates 
draw men to adventure over the seas 
to sayl into india 
and the remotest parts of the world 
though they perceive many perils in the voyage 
did we assuredly believe the promises of life 
it would make us endeavour early and late to compass that everlacting inheritance 
what is the root of all indifferency in religion 
but want of judgment 
sixthly 
good judgment brings us to be acquainted with our selves 
to see our misery 
vanity and folly 
to take sound tryal of our estates 
to prevent occasions of sinne 
to discerne what is fit for our condition 
how to carry our selves inoffensively 
and to proceed in godliness in good order 
for lack of judgment we perceive not many things that be amisse 
know not what to resolve in many doubts 
are oft plunged concerning our estate 
see not how to encounter the assaults of satan 
are hurt before we be aware 
and be to seek how we should behave our selves towards others
q should all christians be able of themselves to try and examine which is a true or false doctrine
a 
all christians should be able 
though not of themselues 
nor by themselves onely 
but by the rule of scripture 
which is the touch-stone that our saviour and his apostle giveth into their hands 
wherewith they themselves should try the truth or falshood of the doctrine that is brought 
for 
is there any so sensess as to give a man a touch-stone into his hand to try the goodness and lawfulness of the gold 
and yet withall to charge him that he shall not use it himself 
but alwaies when he is doubtfull of a piece of money 
go to the goldsmith without daring once to enter into any judgment of the unlawfulness or lawfulness of it by himself 
and yet both the touch-stone of the scriptures which god hath given us for the tryal of truth 
is incomprably better then any touch-stone of the goldsmith 
and the difference of true doctrine and false 
is infinitly greater then the difference between fine and pur gold 
and base and bell-mettalljoh 
220 
27 
and when as john ascribeth unto every one of the church the anoynting of the spirit 
which teacheth them whatsoever is necessary 
it is evident that he will have that every one shall be instructed to try the spirit 
especially considering that the apostle teacheth that the spirituall man 
that is to say a man indued with the spirit of adoption 
judgeth all things so farre as they may necessarily concerne him1 cor 
215 
and unless the faithfull should be able to try and discerne
of the divers colours of mens doctrines 
how should they once desire the help of their pastors and governours 
for the blind eateth 
as they say 
many a fly 
a man cannot so much as surmise the doubtfulness or superstitiousness of any doctrine 
unless he be able to make some tryal of the doctrine himself2 pet 119 
with 2 pet 
21 
wherefore our doctrine which teacheth that every one should try the spirits by the light which himself carrrieth about him 
is so farre from taking away the help and assistance they should have of their governours 
that unless it have place 
there is no place for the other 
seeing no man can pray aid against his enemy coming towards him 
unless he be first able to discover him to be an enemy
q 
the discerning of spirits is not given to all men
a 
the apostle speaks of that discretion of spirits which is miraculous1 cor 
129 
10 which although it be sometimes aided by outward things 
as by behaviour and countenance 
yet it gathereth 
and discerneth more 
then it hath by ordinary discourse 
any certain ground of 
for the skill of the scriptures 
and judgment in them1 cor 
122 
9 
10 
both that which is ordinary consisting in knowledge and wisdom 
and that which is extraordinary consisting in prophesie 
is manifestly distinguished from the gift of discretion of spirits 
and it is evident 
that as there were many that excelled in judgment of sound and unsound doctrine 
which had not this gift of discretion of spirits 
so this gift of discerning spirits reached not so much unto the discerning of doctrines one from another 
which might be done by labour and travell in the word of god 
but the use thereof was principally in discovering the traiterous and treacherous natures of those 
which pretending friendship to the church 
either were covert enemies 
or at lest not faithfull friends to the same

the lord gives not every man that perfect knowledge of all things contained in scripture 
nor doth he require 
that by disputation or scholar-like discourse they should confute the adversary in speech or writing 
it is sufficient they be able to give an account of their faith out of the word of truth
q

in the clear 
sound and distinct approbation of good 
both simply and in comparison 
in the first and second act of judgment 
according to the degrees thereof 
upon due tryal and examination 
known and discerned to be truely good 
and the improbation of known evil according to the nature and degrees thereof 
as it is considered in it self and with all occurents 
or inticing allurements 
to which must be added a right discerning of the expediency or inexpediency of things indifferent 
or more briefly 
it is to approve truth and goodness according to the will and after the image of god 
and to reject the contrary
q 
how is this sound and true judgment to be obtained

27a 
1 
the inspiration of the holy ghost 
the authour of supernaturall light and faith 
is necessary 
whereby 
being taught the truth as it is in christ jesus 
we are enabled to discerne what is contrary to the words of wholesome doctrine 
for 
as he that is indued with an humane spirit 
doth easily discerne men from beasts 
so he that hath the spirit of god 
by which he is taught the heavenly doctrine 
discerneth the doctrine of god 
from the doctrine of the devill 
things divine from humane 
nothing is more like it self then god 
none better knows the things of god 
then the spirit of god 
nay 
if we have not the spirit 
we cannot know god nor the things of god 
no more then a blind man can judge of colours 
whence is it that christ saith of the elect 
that they cannot be seduced of antichrist 
to wit 
because the spirit of god doth preserve and keep the truth once engraven in their hearts 
that they cannot fall from it 
2 
the spirit of god in teaching the sonnes of god the heavenly doctrine 
is wont to keep this order 
that first he doth affect them with an earnest desire of heavenly doctrine 
and doth so affect 
that they desire to know the will of god for no other cause 
then that they might avoid whatsoever is displeasing to god 
and do whatsoever is pleasing in his sight 
this desire being stirred up in them 
he provoketh to prayer 
wherein they crave of god 
that he would lead them into all truth 
and teach them to do his will 
if therefore we would know the truth 
first 
we must set our hearts to the love of religion and pietyioh

for if any man will do the will of god 
he shall know the doctrine that is of god 
they shall be all taught of god 
to whom true godliness is a speciall delight and treasure 
secondly 
we must earnestly desire of god to be informed in the true and perfect way 
and without doubt the holy spirit will reveale the truth unto them 
in whom he hath kindled an holy desire of the truth 
cornelius may be for example 
he prayeth to be instructed in the truth of god 
and the lord sendeth peter to shew him the way of life 
and acquaint him with the doctrine of salvation

out of the scriptures we must collect a forme of wholesome doctrine 
according to which other points must be tried and examined 
this is an undoubted principle 
that god is ever like himself 
and that his words do most exactly consent and agree together 
so that no doctrine can be of god 
which is repugnant
to the truth contained in plain places of scripture 
which are in themselves most evident 
and cannot be understood otherwise then as the words manifestly import 
for the authority 
which doth warrant our faith unto us 
must every way be free from all possibility of errour 
for let us but once adnut of this 
that there is any possibility that any one point of faith should not be true 
if it be once granted 
that i may be deceived in what i have believed 
how can i be assured that in the end i shall not be deceived 
if the authour of faith may alter 
or if the evidence and assurance that he hath left us be not pregnant 
and impossible to be defeated 
there is necessarily opened an inlet to doubtfulness and wavering 
which the nature of faith excludes 
fifthly 
our saviour christ hath given a good rule 
whereby we may discerne whether the doctrine be of god 
he that speaketh of himself 
seeketh his own gloryioh 
718 
but he that seeketh his glory that sent him 
the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him 
lastly 
if we would attain sound judgment in the truth 
we must submit our selves to the ministry of the word 
and use the advice and counsell of the prudent and judicious 
for the spirit that openeth our eyes to see the the things that belong to godliness 
stirres up in us a desire to learn 
desire to learn makes us thirst after the meanes 
and pious sedulity and carefulness makes us watchfull in the choice 
and diligent in the use of our meanes 
the promise to the apostles of the spirit which should lead them into all truth 
was made good unto them by private and secret informing their understandings 
with the knowledge of high and heavenly mysteries 
which as yet had never entred into the conceit of any man 
the same promise is made to us 
but fullfiled after another manner 
for what was written by revelation in their heartsgal 
1121 for our instruction have they written in their books 
to us for information the spirit speaks not by immediate revelation 
but sends him to the ministry of the church and to the scriptures 
opening our eyes effectually to discerne the truth contained in them 
and that so much the more 
as they shall be more diligent in the use of all holy meanes that god hath ordained for that end 
the spirit infuses not the knowledge of any point of faith without meanes 
but engraves in the heart what is spoken in the scripture 
according as we shall be faithfull and carefull in the use of his holy ordinances

when we take up opinions lightly without due examination 
relying meerly upon the credit of the teacher 
and be as ready upon every small occasion to receive another doctrine 
the apostle reprehends this inconstancy 
writing to the ephesians 
that we henceforth 
saith he 
be no children 
tossed to and fro 
and carried about with every wind of doctrine 
by the slight of men 
and cunning craftiness 
whereby they ly in waite to deceive 
the sense and meaning of &ampc 
is the rule and ground of our christian faith 
and whensoever we alter it 
we must needs give a new sense unto the word of god 
the especiall cause of this flitting disposition in the common and ordinary sort of men 
is disability to discerne of the strength of such reasons as may be stamped against them 
for which cause they usually start 
and many times fall away 
upon every objection that is made 
secondly 
presumption upon the strength and subtilty of our own wits 
for the holy things of god must be handled with fear and reverence 
not with wit and dalliance 
hereunto sounds that of the apostle 
beware lest any man spoile you through philosophy and vain deceit

28 
the dangerous effects of wit not over-ruled and limited by grace 
hath appeared 
not in the green tree onely 
in young heads 
but in men of constant age 
and great place in church 
for this was that which undid origen 
a man of great learning and industry 
whilst in sublimity of his wit 
in his comments on scripture 
conceiving meteors and alerie speculations 
he brought forth those dangerous errours 
which drew upon
his person the heaviest censure of the church 
and upon posterity the loss of his works 
and not in private persons alone 
but even in whole nations 
shall we find remarkeable examples of miscariage in this kind 
the grecians 
till barbarisme began to steale in upon them 
were men of wonderous subtilty of wit 
and naturally over indulgent unto themselves in this quality 
those deep and subtile heresies concerning the trinity 
the divinity of christ and of the holy ghost 
the union and division of the divine substance and persons 
were all of them begotten in the heat of their wits 
yea by the strength of them were they conceived 
and born 
and brought to that growth 
that if it had been possible for the gates of hell to prevaile against the church 
they would have prevailed this way 
as from the firmest friendships do spring the deadliest enmities 
and from the soundest health the deadliest maladies 
even so from the rarest and quickest agitation of our souls 
the most desperate resolutions and most deadly frensies 
the spirit of man 
if it be quick and vigorous 
industrious 
free and universall 
maketh its motions so irregularly 
useth its liberty so boldly in all things 
not tying it self to any thing

desire or do not desire the object known and judged

and because all willing and nilling doth follow the judgment of man concerning the thing objected 
it is also diverse according to the diversity of the judgment 
but the judgment is two-fold 
for 
either it proceeds from the mind 
approving that to be good which the law prescribeth 
that evil which it forbiddeth 
or it proceedeth from the sense and affection 
esteeming that good which is pleasant 
profitable 
and delightfull 
though forbidden 
disallowing that which appeares difficult 
unprofitable 
unpleasant though it be commanded
there is a judgment of generall estimation 
and a judgment of particular application
1 
there is a first and a second act of judgment 
a judgment of the thing simply considered in it self 
and a judgment of the thing as it is considered with all circumstances 
or as it comes in comparison with others that must be borne 
endured 
or forgone 
and according to these there is a two-fold willing or nilling

considering the thing both simply and in comparison 
which is an effectull compleat willing 
and doth produce the act and prosecute or avoid the thing willed or nilled 
and these two acts of willing or nilling 
are sometimes contrary the one to the other 
for a man may wish that after the first act of judgment 
which he nilleth or doth not prosecut after the second

i 
reasons to shew why our affections are to be exercised according to the rule of gods word 
how a man may come to know to what passion his soul most bendeth 
how the affections are to be ordered 
what that disorder of affection is 
that must be shunned 
and how it may be discovered 
the meanes by which unmortified passions are to be subdued
question 
affections and appetite are subordinate to the will 
let us therefore see how they are to be exercised 
and first 
what reasons there be to shew 
that we must carefully look to our affections 
and exercise them according to the rule of gods word
a 
there be divers reasons that may confirme it 
the first taken from the effects of disordered passions 
1 
wise men confess 
and ignorant prove 
that passions blind their judgments and reason 
as when the eyes are troubled 
we cannot perceive exactly the objects of our sight 
even so 
when the heart is troubled 
no man can come by the knowledge of truth 
as the faculties of our eyes being pure and bright 
it laboureth nothing to deprehend the least moaths 
but if an ill humour descend from the head 
or some darkness fall upon the eyes 
a dimme cloud is cast before the pearles thereof 
which permitteth them not to see 
even gross blocks 
so it befalleth to the soul 
when every inordinate affection is purged that might offend her 
she seeth all things convenient most aptly 
but being troubled with many passions 
all that vertue she loseth 
neither can she behold any high thing 
experience confirmeth this 
for men troubled with vehement passions of hatred 
ire 
or love will bring many reasons to confirme their purpose 
although after they have performed their pleasure 
and the tempestuous passions are over-blown 
they condemn themselves 
and think their fact vicious 
and their reasons frivolous 
passions not unfitly may be compared to green spectacles 
which make all things resemble the colour of green 
even so 
he that loveth 
hateth 
or by any other passion is vehemently possessed 
judgeth all things that occurre in favour of that passion 
to be good and agreeable with reason 
the reasons hereof may be 
first 
the soul being of a determinate power and activity 
cannot attend exactly to
two vehement and intentive operations together 
wherefore the soul being possessed of a vehement passion 
her force is so exhausted in that action 
that if she will continue therein 
she cannot exactly consider the reasons which may disswade her from attending or following such affections 
the passion therefore that hindreth and stoppeth the eyes of the understanding from the consideration of those meanes which might move the mind to withdraw it self from that action 
may well be said to blind the wit 
as he which shutteth another mans eyes 
maketh him blind-fold 
not by taking away the power of seeing 
but only by hindering it from action 
the second reason is 
not only a privation of consideration of those things 
which may extinguish the passion 
but also an enforcement or constraint 
onely to consider those motives or reasons which tend in favour of that passion 
for although the main part of the souls activity be haled away with the passion 
yet there remaineth some sparks of light in the understanding 
to perceive what is represented unto it 
which is almost nothing 
but what may conduce to the continuation and preservation of the distempered affection 
the imagination being prevented 
and almost shut up with the consideration of that which feedeth the passion 
and pleaseth the appetite 
furthermore 
the imagination representeth to the understanding 
not onely reasons that may favour the passion 
but also it sheweth them very intensively 
with more shew and appearance then they are indeed 
for 
as the moon when she riseth or setteth 
seemeth greater unto us 
then indeed she is 
because the vapours or clouds are interposed betwixt our eyes and her 
even so 
the beauty and goodness of the object represented to our understanding 
appeareth fairer and goodlier then it is 
because a cloudy imagination interposeth a mist 
and here it falleth forth 
as he which is most studious 
is best learned 
and commonly 
he that is best learned 
is most studious 
so 
he that once apprehendeth the pleasure of the passion 
ordinarily followeth it 
and the passion encreaseth the imagination thereof 
and the stronger imagination rendreth the passion more vehement 
so that oftentimes they enter with an inch 
and increase an ell 
the third reason 
which importeth more then both the other 
proceedeth from a naughty will 
for that the soul 
having rooted in it 
these two parts 
sensitive and reasonable 
the will perceiving that the soul rejoyceth 
she also contenteth her self 
that the inferiour appetite should enjoy her pleasure 
or eschew her grief 
with reason 
or against reason 
she careth not 
so she may be made partaker 
and for this cause she commandeth the wit to employ all the power and force 
to finde out reasons and perswasions that all the appetite demandeth 
standeth with reason 
and is lawfull 
thus reason is brought to yeeld to the pleasures of sensuality 
the lord to attend upon the servant 
and not only so 
but being once entred into league with passions 
it becometh a better friend to sensuality then the passions were before 
for reason straight-waies inventeth ten thousand sorts of new delights 
which the passions never could have imagined 
2 passions seduce the will 
because the wit being the guide 
the eye 
the stirrer 
and director of the will 
which of it self being blind 
and without knowledge 
followeth that the will representeth 
propoundeth and approveth as good 
wherefore the waves and billowes of apparent reasons 
so shake the sandy shelfe of of a weak will 
that they mingle it with them 
and make all one 
besides 
appetite and affection being rooted in the same soul with the will 
if it be drawn or flyeth from any object 
consequently the other must follow 
even so 
the object that haleth the sensitive part 
draweth with all the will 
and inclining her more to one part then another 
diminisheth her liberty and freedom 
moreover 
the will 
by yeelding to the passion 
receiveth some little bribe of pleasure 
the which moveth her to let the bridle loose unto inordinate appetite 
because she hath ingrafted in her two inclinations 
the one to follow reason 
the other to content the
sense 
and this inclination 
the other being blinded by corrupt judgment 
caused by inordinate passion 
here she feeleth satisfied 
finally the will being the governess of the soul 
and loathing to be troubled with much dissention among her subjects 
as an uncarefull magistrate neglecteth the good of the common-weale to avoid some particular mens displeasure 
so the will being afraid to displease sense 
neglecteth the care she ought to have over it 
specially perceiving that the soul thereby receiveth some interest of pleasure 
or escheweth some paine 
3 
passions mightily change the quiet temper and the disposition of the mind 
for the mind is at peace when the will ruled by prudence 
over-ruleth 
moderateth and governeth passions 
and on the contrary 
the soul is troubled 
when passions arise up and oppose themselves against the rule of government 
first 
passions rebell against reason 
and undermine the understandings of men to their great molestation 
for 
no sooner doth the mind endeavour to ascend to heaven by contemplation 
but inordinate passions hale the heart back again 
and draw it down to the earth 
or privily steale upon us 
and transport the soul clean another way 
secondly 
one passion fighteth with another 
as fear opposeth anger 
covetousness prodigality 
and on a suddain men fall from one extream passion into another 
as from the prime of joy into the sea of grief 
thirdly 
passion is unsatiable 
how encreaseth the passion of covetousness 
as riches encrease 
and herein we may resemble our passions to men affected with a dropsie 
who the more they drink 
the more they thirst 
for drink causeth such a desire and encreaseth it 
even so 
a vehement inordinate passion inclineth vehemently the soul to embrace or fly the object propounded 
and a stronger passion causeth a stronger propension and inclination 
and consequently an insatiable desire of pleasure 
or an exorbitant abhomination of paine 
fourthly 
inordinate passions either prevent reason 
or are stirred up by a corrupt judgment 
and therefore neither observe time 
nor place 
but upon every occasion would be leaping into action 
importuning execution 
let a man fall a praying or studying 
or be busie in any negotiation of importance 
and very often he shall feel a heedless passion to rush in upon him 
importuning him even to leave all 
and prosecute revenge 
lust 
gluttony 
or some other unbridled desire 
sometimes you shall have a number of greedy passions like so many young crowes halfe straved gaping and crying for fond 
every one more earnest then another to be satisfied 
to content them all is impossible 
to content none is intollerable 
to prosecute one and abandon the rest 
is to carry so many hungry vipers gnawing upon the heart strings of the soul 
fifthly 
there is no man in this life which folloeth the stream of his passions 
but expecteth and verily believeth to get at last firme rest 
contentation 
and full satiety of all his appetites 
the which is as possible 
as to extinguish a burning ague with hot wines 
or drown an eele with water 
for 
the desires of passion keep neither sense 
order 
nor measure 
sixthly 
inordinate passion it self is an extream torture and vexation 
the lord in great wisdom having so ordained 
that they that will give way unto them 
should feel the burden and trouble of them 
doth not anger 
envy 
and pride more disquiet them that be distempered 
then they be able to hurt or annoy any other man 
4 
rashness 
inconstancy 
craftiness are the companions of inordinate passions 
the resolutions and determinations of the passionate are unripe 
inconsiderate 
not well concocted 
for judgment blinded with passion 
considereth not exactly 
for the importance of the business 
those circumstances which may withdraw it from the prosecution of such a vitious action 
as they are uncircumspect 
so be they inconstant 
changing from the purposes and resolutions 
which they had prudently determined in the calme of their passions 
and yet passions breed craft 
enforcing the mind to excogitate new waies and meanes for performance of what is affected
what is said of love 
that it is most witty 
that may be said of all other passions 
for 
the passion delighting or afflicting the mind 
causeth the judgment to think 
invent 
devise all meanes possible 
either to enjoy the passion of delight 
or to avoid the molestation of sadness and for 
5 
inordinate passions are hurtfull to the body 
impaire health 
breed humours 
nourish diseases 
shorten life 
the second reason 
to shew that affections must be rightly ordered 
is taken from the profit and benefit of the affections well guided 
and discreetly moderated 
for 
they rather serve for instruments of vertue 
then foments of vice 
and as an occasion of victory 
then a cause of foyl 
christ our saviour in whom neither sinne 
nor inordinate affection could fall 
no doubt was subject to these passions 
my soul is heavy even unto death 
he began to be afraid and heavy 
the scriptures do exhort us to love 
fear 
sorrow 
rejoycing 
mercifulness 
&ampc 
and therefore it were blasphemous to say 
that absolutely all passions were ill 
for so the scriptures should exhort to evil 
lastly 
if the motions of our wils be vertuous 
directed with the square of gods law and prudence 
if the inferiour appetite or passions obey and concurre with the will 
then with much more ease and pleasure 
and delight 
vertuous actions are accomplished and performed 
yea 
oftentimes they take away the molestation and tediousness that occure in the practice of good works 
but of this more hereafter 
in the holy exercise of particular affections
q 
how may a man come to know his affections 
or to what passion his soul most bendeth
a 
1 
consider with what company thou most delightest 
and in them thou shalt see a patterne of thy passions 
for like affecteth like 
customs and companies are cousen germans 
and manners and meetings for the most part sympathize together 
2 
thoughts and words discover affections 
if one think and speak much of beauty 
vaine attire 
glory 
honour or reputation 
if he feel in his heart 
that often he desireth to be praised 
or to insinuate his own praise 
it is most manifest that the passion of pride pricketh him 
and so of all other affections 
because the mind doth think 
and the tongue will speak according to the passions of the heart 
for 
as a rat running behind a painted cloth 
betrayeth her self 
even so 
a passion lurking in the heart 
by thoughts and speeches discovereth it self 
out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh 
for 
as a river abounding with water 
must make an inundation 
and runne over the banks 
even so 
when the heart is overflown with affection 
it must find some passage by the mind 
mouth or actions 
3 
by a certain reflection we may come to discerne our passions or affections 
marke in other men their words 
gestures and actions 
when they seem to thee to proceed from affection ordinate or inordinate 
and having well noted the fruits of affection 
make then a reflection upon thy self 
and weigh whether thou hast done 
or daily doest such like 
4 
it is good also to have a wise and discreet friend 
to admonish us of our passions 
when we erre from the path and plain way of vertue 
for self-love much blindeth a man 
and another may better judge of our actions 
then we can our selves

it chanceth sometimes by the providence of god 
that our enemies 
who pry into our actions and examine more narrowly our intentions then we our selves 
discover unto us better our passions 
and reveale our imperfections 
then we our selves 
lastly 
a good way to know the inclinations of the mind 
is like the manner we come by the knowledge of the inclinations of our bodies 
that is 
by long experience 
for 
as we say 
if a man 
before forty years of age be not a good physician of his own body 
that is 
if he know not whether his inclination bendeth 
what doth him good 
what bringeth harme 
he deserveth to be registred for a fool 
even so 
he that in many years by continuall practice of
his own soul perceiveth not where his passions lie 
he scarce deserveth the name of a wise man 
as he may be begged for an ideot 
who riding an horse for twenty years every day from morning to night 
yet knoweth not the qualities of his horse 
and the wices whereunto he is subject 
so he which every day manageth his own soul 
if after twenty years labour he cannot find whither the inclinations tend 
he may well be thought either very passionate 
or very simple
q 
how are the affections to be ordered
a 
according to the command of faith 
uniformely 
universally 
sincerely 
constantly 
cleaving to all good in an holy order 
and shunning all evil in their severall kinds and degrees 
as they are discovered to be evil by the power of faith judging according to the word of truth 
in what order the affections must be carried unto their severall objects 
hath been noted before in the sanctification of the will and powers subordinate 
and may be taken thence
q 
how are these affections moved in us
a 
faith moveth 
animateth 
and setteth bounds to all sanctified affections 
but there are sundry motives to stirre them up 
the first is sound and true reason 
but 
not every kind of reason hath force to stirre up affection 
but an urgent and potent 
either really or at least in conceit 
this we may prove by experience 
for common and ordinary motives move us not much to love or like a thing 
wherefore god to induce the israelites to wish and desire the land of promise 
described it as a countrey flowing with milk and hony 
&ampc 
and commonly every one who would perswade us to love or affect any thing 
highly commendeth it 
or contrariwise 
if a man would have us to hate and detest any thing 
he endeavoureth as much as may be to make apparent the excess of evils 
or great damages it importeth 
passions then must be moved with urgent reasons clearly 
distinctly 
soundly apprehended 
and he that would move passion in other must deale discreetly 
imitating herein the common practice of prudent physicians 
who apply their medicine to the same maladies with particular respect and consideration of the patients temper 
and so to a little child they will not give the like purgation they would to a strong man 
in like manner 
common people and profound doctors 
are not to be perswaded with the same arguments 
for 
popular perswasions these prize not 
and deep demonstrations they pierce not 
the way to fit both sorts 
is 
to propound deep reasons plainly 
and plausible perswasions sharply 
that the plainness of the one may make them plausible 
and acuteness in the other may make them pleasant 
in the reasons which are produced to move and affect 
great perspicuity is required 
because the attention which otherwise should be imployed about the affection 
will wholly be consumed or drawn to the understanding 
for 
it is impossible to attend much at one time both to speculation and affection 
again 
our reasons should be largely declared 
yet with sharp and short variety inter-laced 
resembling a volley of shot speedily delievered 
but not without bullets to batter down the wals of wilfull affections 
and as passions are diverse 
so motives to stirre them up are various 
2 
affections are moved by the holy use of the senses 
which are the gates whereby pass and repass all messages sent unto them 
affections are stirred by the hearing of the earlam 
351 
much more by the sight of the eye 
mine eye breaketh my heart 
no sense is so sure and certain of his object and sensation 
as the sight 
no sense rangeth abroad and pierceth the skies like unto this 
no sense hath such variety of objects to seed and delight it 
as this 
no sense imprinteth so firmely his formes in the imagination 
as this 
no sense serveth the soul so much for knowledge 
as this 
no sense is put so oft in action 
as this 
no sense sooner moveth 
then this 
and consequently 
no sense
well guided 
more profitable to the soul then this 
and here it is to be considered 
that affections are not onely moved by their principall objects and directly 
but also by certain appurtenances 
appendices 
or scraps of the principal object 
indirectly 
which appertaine and have some reference thereunto 
the reason of it 
is from the very nature and heart of every affection 
for when we love god 
our parents 
or friends 
we are well pleased 
and contented with all those treasures of goodness 
honesty 
wealth 
and all other perfections they have 
and wish them such as beseem them 
which they want 
and this we desire to see performed 
and rejoyce when it is accomplished 
in hatred and envy contrariwise 
every one detesteth not onely the person 
but also all that pertaineth unto him 
neither can he abide to see any thing prosper which concerneth him 
3 
musick will move affections 
as joy 
and sadness 
heavenly songs 
as they be arguments of spirituall joy 
so do they kindle and inflame it 
but how causeth musick sorrow and sadness 
what are jeremies lamentable threens 
but a sorrowfull song breathed over the city of jerusalem 
what are davids penitentiall psalmes 
but mournfull themes inclining the soul to sorrow for sinne 
elizeus prepared his spirit to receive the influence of prophesie by the straines of musick 
david in penning psalms 
ordaining instruments 
providing musicians for the service of god 
by word and deed taught uspsal 
848 
by the vertue of musick to stirre up men to devotion 
and for this cause it hath been usuall amongst them in the old testament 
after any great grace or favour shewed them by god 
to rouse up their souls with musicall songs and instruments to give thanks 
to give him thanks 
and praise his name 
for the bestowing of such benefitsexo

imparting to them such great good 
or delivering them from such evils 
and the christian church for the same effect useth the harmony of voyces 
and that by the warrant of the holy ghost 
4 
action in the speaker doth move affection in the hearer 
but here it is to be noted 
that he that would affect another in any kind 
must be moved first himself 
and as the internall passion is more vehement 
the externall perswasion will be the more potent 
for 
how shall my reasons perswade another 
when they have not first wrought upon my self
q 
what is the disorder of affection that must be shunned
a 
affections be disordered 
1 
when they are blindly or superstitiously moved 
and not according to sound judgment 
if the mind 
which is the guide of affection 
mistake and erre 
the affections 
which follow the errour of mind 
cannot keep good rank 
zeal is evil 
when it is not according to knowledge 
2 
affections 
that prevent judgment or resist reason 
and follow sense 
inclination 
or appetite 
are unruly and inordinategal 
524 
rom 126 
rom 
75 
god hath ordained 
that affections should ever keep within the pale of sound reason 
and move according to her information 
if at any time they refuse her guidance 
and turn after vanity 
agreeable or pleasing to corrupt sense 
they are without compass and range amiss 
and the danger of giving way to loose affections is very great 
for 
as wild horses that have gotten the reignes upon their own necks 
runne hither and thither to the danger of the rider 
so passions carry men up and down into many evils 
after they have burst the bands of reason 
he that hath no rule over his own spirit 
is as a city broken down and without wals 
as a city without fence lyeth open to the spoyl to be sackedprov 2528 
burned 
and taken by the enemy at pleasure 
so are they exposed to the tentations of satan 
and to the fraud and illusion of wicked men 
who are ruled by their lusts and passions 
3 
partiall affections are vicious 
when some good suiting with our disposition or corrupt affection is desired 
loved 
pursued 
but some other no less good 
necessary and excellent is disaffected 
universall good is the object of good affections 
if we affect not every good that beareth the
stamp of god 
we affect no good sincerely as we ought 
4 
immoderate affections are vicious 
when some inferiour good is desired with greater eagerness then is meet2 tim 1 7

and the chief not affected as it ought 
the desire of children is not unlawfull 
but to be passionate for them 
as was rachel 
give me children or else i die 
is much awry 
5 
inconstant flitting affections are to be reprehended 
for 
god requires that the heart be constantly set upon him 
and carried to that which he requireth 
6 
affections are most out of order when they resist good 
and follow evil
q 
how are disordered affections discovered and made manifest to others
a 
by words and deeds 
speech and action 
speech is the image of life 
and discovereth what is hidden in the mind 
if mens words openly tend to their own commendations 
if they brag or boast of their valour in warres 
learning 
qualities given by nature 
or purchased by nature 
it is plain that they are of a proud disposition 
if they discourse lasciviously or shamelessly 
questionless what the tongue speaketh the heart affecteth 
much speech and hasty 
proceedeth from rash foolishness 
a fool uttereth all his mind 
prov 
2911 
in some majesticall and very grave persons 
whose prudence and wisdom men much admire 
few words pithy and leasurely spoken 
argue both wisdom 
gravity and magnanimity 
but slowness of speech in some others 
if it proceed not from naturall impediment in the instruments of speaking 
is a token of slowness in conceiving 
or of some great vain conceit they have of their own wisdom 
which they would distill into other men by drops 
much affectation in speech proceedeth from most vain and notorious pride 
which maketh men seek to please itching ears to gaine applause and commendation from them 
scoffing 
gibing 
nipping 
and quipping with intendment of disgrace 
proceedeth from pride and malice 
for 
it declareth contempt of others 
or a great desire to bring them into disesteem 
to dispute contentiously about matters that surpass our capacity 
or at least that we understand not 
for lack of exercise 
study 
or practice 
cannot but argue great ignorance or arrogancy 
for 
no wise man will contend in such matters as he knoweth not 
it is not unbeseeming an ignorant man to propound his doubt to the learned 
that he may be informed 
but to contend about things beyond our sphere is no point of wisdom 
contradictions speech 
whereby men shew themselves in company 
able to controll 
and gainesay other mens opinions 
is rooted in vain glory 
to discover secrets of importance to every man almost upon the first fight 
before tried and sound experience of firme and faithfull friendship 
is a token of much indiscretion and simplicity 
the wicked inventions 
which many use to sow dissention between friends 
proceedeth from a most malitious 
uncharitable 
and envious mind 
which hateth the peace of friends 
it argueth also a crafty politick wit 
apt to sift out other mens actions affections also are discovered by actions 
for 
as if the fruit and flowers be corrupted or vicious 
we know the root must be infected 
so if mens words or actions be disconforted 
doubtless the soul cannot be well-disposed 
a troubled fountain yeeldeth unpure water 
and an infected soul 
vitious actions 
pride 
choler 
and covetousness 
commonly wait upon great gamesters 
who vaunt of their gaine 
if they win 
chafe if they be crossed in their game 
and in as mad a mood 
boast of their loss 
if they lose 
although the most pleasure in play consisteth in victory 
yet to affect it too much 
to rangle 
to chafe 
to fret therefore argueth an unmortified affection 
to think 
talk 
and earnestly procure to have great chear 
to feast often 
to delight therein much 
are tokens of gluttony 
jerfull and fumish pronuntiation is the flame of that choler that lodgeth in the breast 
fidling about our garments 
gazing upon our selves 
majesticall walking 
except in persons of authority 
are tokens of foolishness 
pride
and inconstancy 
if we see one much to please himself with others praises 
and 
as it were 
to feed upon the wind of mens words 
we may be assured that self-love and vanity possess the best tenement of his heart 
and this we may know 
if the person praised 
either openly confess it 
understand insinuate it 
or as it were with a countenance silently approve it 
for 
as gold is tried by the fire 
so a man by the mouth of a prayser 
new-fangledness in apparell proceedeth from levity and inconstancy of mind 
and the root of gay and gorgeous apparell 
pride and arrogancy 
commonly by conversation men discover their affections 
for he that frequenteth good company 
for the most part is honest 
and he that useth ill company 
can hardly be vertuous 
but of these things more at large in the discovery of particular affections
q 
how are unmortified passions to be subdued
a 
1 
to bridle extraordinary and unlawfull pleasures 
it is good to accustome our selves to abstaine from lawfull and not prohibited 
he shall not fall in things unlawfull 
that warily restraines himself sometimes in things lawfull 
for 
if one be addicted to drunkenness 
he shall with more facility overcome this passion 
if he abstaine from strong drinkes he most affecteth 
even at such times as lawfully he may use them 
2 
fly the occasions which may incense the passions where unto we are inclined 
for a commodious and fit occasion to steale maketh oftentimes thieves 
who otherwise would have been honest men 
wherefore he that committeth himself to sea in a boisterous tempest 
deserveth to suffer shipwrack 
and he that willingly without necessity dealeth with infected persons 
may blame himself if he fall into their diseases 
for this cause the lord commanded that the nazarites which were consecrated to him 
should drink no wine 
nor any thing that might cause drunkenness 
and lest they should by eating grapes and great reysins be allured to drink winenumb 
6 1 
2 
3 
he commanded them they should neither eat grapes nor reysins 
the third remedy may be drawn out of the very poyson of passions 
that is 
when a most vehement and rebellious motion assaulteth us 
when the fierceness and tyranny thereof well-nigh possesseth us 
when we are almost yeelding consent unto it 
then should we turn the force of our soul with as much endeavour as we can to the contrary good1 cor 10 
2 cor 
89 
and with one naile drive out another 
make of tentations a benefit 
let vertue in infirmity and weakness of resistance be more perfect and ennobled 
for 
as in warres the valiantest souldiers in greatest encounters are best tried 
so in most vehement passions 
the resolutest minds are best proved 
for 
josephs chastity had never been so glorious 
if his unchast lady had not so vehemently allured him to defile the bed of his lord 
jobs patience had never been so conspicuous 
if the passion of grief and sadness had not so violently seized upon him 
abrahams fortitude had never been so heroicall 
if the death of his onely son had not cut in a manner his heart-strings asunder 
this meane is one of the most forcible and important remedies that men can use 
especially for two causes 
the first 
that by these contrary acts are bred in the souls 
certain habits 
helps 
stayes 
or inclinations most opposite unto our passions 
and therefore the passions being strong 
they cannot be overcomed 
but by the might of excellent vertue 
for 
as the deeper a tree is rooted in the ground 
it requireth greater force to pull it up 
even so 
the greater possession the passions have taken of the soul 
the greater vertue it needeth to supplant it 
it seemeth that job 
after so mny temptations practised this remedy 
when he saithjob 
1315 
although god kill me 
yet i will hope in him for questionless 
those pangs did incite him to desperation 
the which with contrary trust in god he most valiantly suppressed another cause may be yeelded 
for that many passions proceed 
not onely from the inclinations of nature 
alterations of humours 
bt by the
very suggestion of the devill 
who watcheth his opportunity 
to take men at an advantage 
and to induce them to sundry inordinate affections 
for which cause they are called unclean spirits 
because they lead men into unclean passions and actions 
the devill therefore seeing his temptations so valiantly resisted 
his poysoned darts rebounding into his own breast 
i mean his illusions redound to his own shame and confusion 
dareth not be so bold another time to invade so strong a fort 
but with all his troope will fly from it 
as a swarm of flies dare not approach near unto a boyling potjam 
47 
resist the devill 
and he will fly from you 
the fourth remedy is to resist passions at the beginning 
in all soares and diseases it is an approved rule 
that we must withstand the beginnings 
cure the wound whiles it is green 
and take physick before the malady have taken rooting 
use the remedy for vertue 
that pharaoh practiced for tyranny 
in killing all the infants of the jews 
lest they should encrease too much 
and so over-runne his countrey 
passions 
while they knock at the door of the mind 
whilest they are a little entertained if we expell them not quickly 
they will lodge longer with us then we would have them 
and the most easie way of all 
and by spirituall men daily put in ure 
is to drive the thoughts to some other object 
for 
as we use in common conversation 
when two be brawling about any thing 
to divert their talk to another matter 
for as long as they continue about the same subject 
they are in danger to fall into the same inconvenience 
so the best way to expell an inordinate passion 
is 
to transport the attention to some other matter 
as he that will be rid of an ill guest 
the worse he entertaineth him 
the sooner he shall be dispatched of him 
the fifth remedy to mortifie passions is1 cor 
927 
to chastise the body 
for 
questionless he that pampereth his body 
feedeth his enemy 
and he that will feed it wi h dainties 
cannot but find it rebellious 
spare diet 
and much waking 
is the best meanes to tame wild beasts 
pamper an horse 
and you shall have him too wanton 
pamper the flesh 
and it will kindle passion to over-rule 
and he that will mortifie his passions 
and let his body flow with delicates 
doth like him which will extinguish fire by adding more fewell 
the sixth remedy requireth a resolute good will and endeavour to attain unto this perfect government of a mans self 
whence-from will follow a diligent execution of mortification 
for 
such a man will not cease daily and incessantly to demand grace and favour of god to overcome his rebellious nature 
resist temptations 
whithstand all false allurements of this inticing world 
such an one will examine daily his conscience 
and note what thoughts 
words 
or deeds against god himself 
and his neighbour 
he hath committed 
whereby either vertue is extinguished 
or vice encreased 
such an one will determine in the morning when he ariseth 
not to let pass that day 
without the extirpating of some stinking and poysoned thorne 
and planting some sweet and pleasant flower within the garden of his soul 
such an one will not onely prevent occasions 
but also arme himself as well as he can to resist such temptations as he knoweth especially shall be offered in certain places and companies 
which he cannot conveniently avoid 
to this helpeth greatly the consideration of that small pleasure 
passions do yeeld 
for almost in a moment they are commenced 
practised 
and past 
wherefore much better it were to cross them a little 
and win a crown of glory 
then to please them a moment 
to be condemned to hell 
the seaventh remedy 
when thy passions are most vehement 
then humble thy self before god with sorrow and shame 
and seek for succour from heaven 
fly under the wings of christ 
beat at the gates of mercy 
and by the prayer of faith 
crave grace to overcome thy misery 
he is thy father 
and will not give thee a serpent 
if thou ask him a fish 
cast down thy self before him 
open thy soares and wounds unto him 
and the good samaritane will poure in both wine and oyl 
and then thou snalt see thy pssions melt and fall away as clouds are consumed by the sunne
lastly 
by serious meditation upon the death and resurrection of christ 
we must work our hearts into the similitude of christ 
that his vertues may be stamped upon our soul 
and we be made like unto him in righteousness and true holiness 
the healing vertue of christs death applied unto our hearts 
will heale our affections 
and renew them according to their first integrity
q 
how is a man to behave and carry himself when he is troubled with passions
a 
the first point of prudence 
which all prudent men confess and observe 
is to perswade our selves when we are moved with a vehement passion 
that our souls are then 
as it were infected with a pestilent ague 
which both hindereth the sight of our eyes 
and the taste of our tongues 
that is 
corrupteth the judgment 
and perverteth the will 
that as certain spectacles make mountains seem mole-hils 
and others 
mole-hils like mountains 
even so 
passions make the passionate to judge all those things which tend to the favour of his passion 
reasonable 
great and worthy 
and all that stands against it 
base 
vile and naughty 
hereupon followeth 
that at what time the passion is afloate 
and reigneth 
it were not good to make any resolution or determination of change 
for 
there be few men living 
which have not over-shot themselves in this point 
and repented when their souls were calmed 
that they committed when they were tempested 
2 
the second point may be 
not to vex and trouble thy selfe too much when a passion seizeth upon thee 
but diverting thy mind from it 
and restraining thy consent as well as thou canst from yeelding unto it 
and in short time thou shalt see it vanish away 
as we prove in daily temptations of ire 
sadness 
love 
lust 
and such like 
which fall and consume away even by themselves 
either because the impression made in the imagination diminisheth 
or the attention of the soul distracted with other matter 
faileth 
or some other passion expelleth it 
or the devill ceaseth to tempt 
either all these 
or most of them mitigate 
consume 
and wholly subvert that passion which before so troubled us 
and seemed insuperable 
the third point which ought principally to be considered 
and well weighed of those whose passions are most vehement and inordinate 
is this 
that they which perceive in themselves such disordered affections 
ought first to know the root of them to be self-love 
and the greater they find the boughs of their passions 
the greater and deeper root let them be assured 
lyeth hidden under the bottome of their soul 
for which cause 
such men must perswade themselves to have great difficulty to vertue 
and extream facility to vice 
that as they love pleasures of the body exceedingly 
so they hate all that may hinder or oppose it self thereunto mightily 
that they be blinded as battes in their own conceits 
apprehending that they love or hate 
far differently from that it is in very deed 
that they be commonly too rash 
attempting greater enterprises then their forces are able to performe 
and for the most part more bold then wise 
guiding their actions not by reason and judgment 
but by haire-braine affections 
and as they are headlong and obstinate when strong passions possess them 
so are they irresolute and inconstant when a weak affection doth move them 
for 
being accustomed to follow their appetites 
as long as they continue they persist in one mood 
but after the weak passion is appeased 
their judgments and determinations are changed 
these men ought to be wonderfull in their words 
and circumspect in their actions 
alwaies having themselves suspected 
wherefore it is good for them 
first 
to crave of god help and grace 
to overcome so hard a nature 
secondly 
to conferre with wise and discreet men about their own affairs and determinations 
rather relying upon them then their own judgments 
thirdly 
that every day they use some mean to overcome their perverse nature 
for 
as we prove by experience 
such men have many crosses and griefs of mind 
their company commonly all eschew 
and to be short they are a burden to themselves 
and others 
whereas if they would but with a little diligence moderate their passions 
they would be humble and affable
there is no sort of men 
whose conversation would be more gratefull then theirs 
for they are like unto a fat soyl that yeeldeth great abundance of what is sown 
good or evil 
corne or darnell 
flowers or weeds 
the fourth point of prudence is 
to conceale as much as we can our inclinations 
or that passion we know our selves most prone to follow 
for it impeacheth questionless greatly a grave mans credit 
a great mans authority 
and a civil mans good conversation 
to be subject to some one only inordinane passion 
for such a corrupt judgment hath now so much prevailed with men 
yea 
and ever hath been 
that they will contemn the whole 
for some notable defect 
as for example 
if we see a picture of man or woman 
drawn with excellent colours 
great proportion 
and art 
yet if there be but one eye 
one arme 
yea 
or one finger out of square 
men will say 
the image is spoiled for that one defect 
even so 
we try by daily talk 
that commonly men descant upon other mens doings 
they will say 
such a nobleman is resolute in wars 
goodly in person 
but subject to choler 
too much addicted unto his own judgment 
such a man excelleth in learning 
but pride over-ruleth him 
such a senatour judgeth profoundly 
but is impatient in hearing of causes 
such a man reigneth in the pulpit 
but is blinded with covetoussnes 
such a man giveth great almes 
but attendeth too much to good cheer 
many inconveniences may follow 
if others know what passions men are subject unto 
for if thy enemies would be revenged of thee 
no fitter meanes they might sleightly use 
then to procure some way whereby thy passions should be stirred and put in execution 
for by often ministring matter 
thy passions would easily subdue thee 
and by those baits it will not be hard to bring thee into the power of thine adversary 
it is therefore a point of wisdom 
to conceale passions as much as may be 
and seriously to dispraise in words 
that passion whereunto we are most inclined 
i say not this 
because i would have men to regard more their credit and reputation with men 
then the approbation of god 
or to dread the danger of an enemy 
more then the great displeasure of almighty god 
or yet to do one thing 
and speak another 
but that if he cannot but sometime of fragility slide 
it may be a good way to recall him again 
and not to fall so often 
if he speak in dispraise of his own fault 
for men will be ashamed to commit often 
that they themselves dispraise eagerly 
lastly 
it is an high point of prudence to look well into the measure 
deformity 
and inconvenience of our passion 
to shame our selves for it before god 
and to endeavour to master and overcome our selves in private 
so shall we be better able to subdue and keep them under in our conversing with others 
to abate the power of turbulent affections 
it is good every day to be drawing somewhat from them 
and if at any time they exceed 
though but a little 
upon private occasions 
to curb them by the power of grace 
and to arraigne them before the tribunall of grace 
continuall watchfulness and daily judging of our smaller aberrations 
doth keep under sinne 
that it shall not domineer over us

generall rules to direct us how to deale with them that be passionate

of the sanctified exercise of those affections that embrace their object 
and of those that decline their object 
with reasons to move us to affect that which is good 
and to avoid that which is evil

whose inclinations are most cruel 
whose passions most fierce 
yet one affecteth another 
and liveth in quiet society 
for the similitude of inclinations 
and likeness of passions 
hereupon followeth 
that if thou wilt please thy master-friend 
or companion 
thou must as much as may be without sinne apparell thy self with his affections 
and condescend to what is pleasing in his sight 
so farre as will stand with a good conscience 
but sometimes likeness of passion engendreth contention 
as we say one potter hateth another 
and among proud men there are ever brawlings 
for if similitude of passions prejudicateth profit 
dignity or honour 
then likeness of affections causeth dissention 
proud men be pleased with praises 
honour 
and account 
discontented with comparisons 
with commending their equals 
in not yeelding them honour 
in disparaging their actions 
this wisely discerned and fore-known 
giveth direction how we may prevaile with men addicted to such passions 
2 
men commonly hate those whom they know to be of contrary passions 
whereupon proceedeth that common proverb 
he that hateth whom i love 
how can he love me 
for 
as fire with fire doth never jarre 
so fire and water can never agree 
from which ground may be drawn this rule 
that when men are pssessed of a vehement passion 
they must not be dealt with by apprehension or indignation 
especially in vehement manner 
but rather by mild and soft perswasions 
for 
he that is passionate will hardly be perswaded by him 
whom he conceiveth contrary to him 
yea 
often those that at other times were good friends 
in time of passions for such opposition 
fall into endless contention 
we see 
when an house in the middest of the street is vehemently inflamed 
it were bootless to quench the flame with water 
but the best remedy 
and commonly practised 
is to pull down the next houses 
that thereby the lack of foment might diminish the flame 
so 
him that rageth with anger 
hardly you shall appease by wrangling or chiding 
but either answer mildly 
for 
a soft answer pacifieth strife 
or answer nothing 
withdrawing the matter of anger from the sight 
this rule holdeth universally in all those which be our equals 
or at least do not much exceed us in state 
or we them 
but if a superiour 
or a magistrate see his inferiour 
or subject 
vehemently carried in any passion 
he may threaten or reprehend him 
because one passion often cureth another 
so here 
the passion
of fear may expell the passion of anger 
lust 
or what else soever tempteth 
either to the passionates evil 
or any disorder in the common-wealth 
albeit 
if the passion tend not presently to some sinne or great offence 
it may be better to deferre such reprehensions till the subject be more capable of them 
3 
be not too credulous to men in their own causes 
for as self-love for the most part conceives what appertaineth to our selves 
with a greater shew of good and honesty 
then indeed the thing carrieth with it 
so men moved therewith 
declare the matter as they conceive it 
for words spring from conceits 
these are the tree 
those the flowers and leaves 
which do follow by just proportion 
contrariwise 
other mens matters 
which hinder our profit or cross our designes 
for the most part we extennate and abase 
4 
mild modest 
humble 
meek men are beloved universally 
because we think them vertuous

pacified the anger of the ephraimites 
who began very hotly 
though without any just cause 
to expostulate with him 
that he called them not to go with him to battell against the enemiesprov 
151 
a soft answer putteth down anger 
the second blow makes the fray 
as the proverb goeth 
wrath wanteth matter to work upon 
if it be not opposed 
meekness shameth anger 
humility makes pride to hang down the head 
thus david by abigails mildness 
was stayed from the bloudy attempt which nabals boisterous roughness provoked him unto 
thereby abraham prevailed with lot 
contraries are cured with contraries 
as we know 
and physicians cure not hot agues by inflaming 
but asswaging 
the skilfull fencer doth scape many a blow 
and foyl his adversary by declining and giving back 
and not by opposing his body and weapon unto it 
cannon-shot batters down castles and walls 
which yeeld not 
but rebound from the soft pack of wooll 
that gives place and resists not 
the lightning passeth by slight and slender objects 
but consumes and devoures the solid and well-compact substances 
and yet 
who is he that sheweth forth this meekness and wisdom 
but 
as is to be seen in the common jarrings and quarrels of men 
the most count it their glory 
and boast of it afterwards 
when their words be fierce and more stinging then their fellowes 
and come out of a furnace seven times hotter then his 
what 
saith he 
did he think i would turn my face from him or be put down with words 
no 
i trow i gave him the full measure that he brought 
yea ten for it 
i spared him not a whit 
loe how fools fome out the froth of their own shame 
it were indeed an honour for a man to depart 
and say 
i see he was not in frame to be answered with angry words 
therefore i durst not strive to out-shoot the devill 
as it were 
in his own bow 
that which he thinks becometh him 
i count it my reproach 
who profess to fight against my corrupt nature 
but this is not to be taken 
as though in all things we ought to yeeld to froward and peevish persons 
but in our own private cases onely 
and when we lawfully may 
but in no cases or matters that are contrary to gods will 
or prejudiciall to his honour 
if any rough 
boisterous 
proud spirit 
be more incensed by meekness 
rather then overcome thereby 
roughness towards such bad and base natures 
is more meet then kindness 
so a man keep his measure 
and contain himself within the limits of his calling 
and under colour of resisting sinne in another 
disobey not god 
give not liberty to his own disordered passions 
thus elisha willed the elders to answer jehorams servant2 king 
632

if thou wouldst work a man to pensiveness 
sorrow for sin 
the fear of god 
take the opportunity that god seemeth to offer 
when he openeth the ear 
and mollifyeth the heart by afflictions 
crosses that make the heart sad 
and cast it down with heaviness 
make way for the entrance of godly sorrow 
strike then for
the iron is hot 
6 
no man ought to be employed to any office 
act 
or exercise contrary to his natural passions or inclination 
for 
by long experience we learn 
that men be oftentimes imployed to one trade 
and never can profit therein 
contrariwise 
when either they of themselves 
or others 
do change that course to another 
whereunto they are inclined 
they become very excellent men 
for 
if inclination be lacking 
the subject strive against the stream 
this rule may not be understood so absolutely 
but that it admitteth some limitation 
for some contrary inclination or passion 
proceedeth not from defect of nature 
or inability of mind 
but from an ill and vitious self-will or wilfulness 
and then it were good with sweetness and inticements to allure such a person to follow that science 
art 
or trade 
whereunto nature most inclineth him 
another exception is 
if the impediments of nature be but small 
and the habiliments otherwise great 
then the one ought to over-rule the other 
and after a little labour in overcoming that impediment 
will follow a great facility in the atchievement of the rest
q 
how may the affections be divided
a 
they may be ranked into two kinds 
some embrace their objects 
as love 
joy 
desire 
other shunne and decline them 
as hatred 
fear 
&ampc 
first 
touching the order of passions in generation and production 
they all acknowledge love to be their fountain 
root 
and mother 
for those that fly evil 
presuppose the love of some good 
the which that evil depriveth 
as for example 
who hateth death 
but he which loveth life 
who feareth adversity 
but he that loveth prosperity 
and amongst them that prosecute good 
love proceedeth 
for the passions of our mind are not unlike the motions of our bodies 
for as things naturally moved 
have an appetite or natural inclination to the place whereunto they are moved 
and rest therein 
so it is with the affections 
desire and joy presuppose love of what we move unto 
or rejoyce in 
this ordinary course keep passions 
but sometimes this subordination is changed 
for 
if a man be wounded 
upon a suddain 
the present passion of grief and ire invade him 
and so in many other cases 
by accident 
the foresaid order may be broken 
secondly 
if we discourse of those passions with reside in the sensitive appetite 
it ever intendeth pleasure and delight 
because therewith nature is most contented 
from which intention followeth love 
hatred 
ire and such like 
nevertheless 
vertuous men 
whose passions are ruled by reason 
level at an higher marke 
and subordinate pleasure to honesty 
and delight to vertue 
because 
as we say 
glory waiteth on vertue 
as the shadow followeth the body 
even so 
unto good actions followeth a certain pleasure and sweetness 
thirdly 
if we compare our passions in dignity or perfection 
then those wherewith we prosecute good 
are more excellent then those wherewith we eschew ill 
and among these 
love holdeth the principall place 
and as a queen in dignity preceedeth the rest 
because that love uniteth the lover in affection with the object beloved 
love is the root of all other affections 
love joyneth us in friendship with god and man
q 
wherein consists the sanctified exercise of those affections that embrace or prosecute their object
a 
in this 
that they move to all known good soundly 
orderly 
in fit season 
constantly at the command and appointment of a lively and wel-planted faith
q 
what reasons are there to move us to affect that which is good
a 
if we that be christians will expend what meanes we have to do good 
and what to do ill 
we shall find that these be fewer in number 
and weaker in force and efficacy 
then the other 
we are moved to do well 
first 
by the law of nature imprinted in our hearts 
like a lanthornerom 21 
or a torch to direct
us in the darkness of the continuall night of this miserable life 
secondly 
we see in every good common-weale vertuous men preferred 
esteemed 
and accounted of 
why then should not credit and reputation nourish and augment vertue 
thirdly 
by natural discourse a man may well perceive how the oyl of his carnall lamp daily consumeth 
the natural heat vanisheth 
death approacheth 
and therefore 
why should not the vicinity and certainty of death cause him to lead a vertuous life 
fourthly 
nothing can have more force to allure a man to do well 
then the peace and tranquility of the mind 
a quiet and serene conscience is a continuall feast 
this we gaine by vertue 
this we loose by vice 
fifthly 
why was christ drawn up the cross 
but to draw us to vertue from vice 
why was he crucified 
but to kill sinne 
why did he rise again 
but to quicken us to newness of life 
sixthly 
the internall gifts of god 
the armour of faith 
hope 
and charity 
with graces and favours 
wherewith the holy ghost endueth our souls 
fortifies us against vice 
and habilitates exceedingly to vertue 
seventhly 
the manifold inspirations of god 
tend to no other end 
then to perswade us to vertue 
and disswade us from vice 
eighthly 
why hath god provided so many teachers and preachers 
but to be so many watchmen over the house of israel 
to keep them from sinne 
and allure them unto godliness 
ninthly 
the holy scriptures were written with the finger of god 
as registers of his eternall will 
letters of love to invite us to vertue 
and threatnings of ire 
to dehort us from vice 
therein by more sure authority he delivereth unto us whatsoever he had written more obscurely in the book of nature 
perswading 
directing 
counselling to goodness 
piety 
and religion 
disswading 
diverting 
threatning 
and terrifying from vice 
impiety and ungodliness 
wherefore one of the chiefest scopes for which that sacred volume was sent from heaven 
was to make us decline from evil 
and do good 
die to old adam 
and live to christ 
crucify sinne 
and follow vertue 
tenthly 
the sacraments of the church 
those seales of the covenant 
and linkes wherewith the members of christs church are united in religion 
were they not instituted for the spirituall refreshing and watering of our souls to the increase of vertue 
eleventhly 
god in his infinite wisdom and love 
hath given us 
not onely teachers in words 
but also actors in deeds 
not onely them that filled our ears with godly perswasions 
but also them which represented vertue most lively to our eyes 
with good examples and holy actions 
so were the lives of saints in all ages as so many starres 
which give us light how to walk in the darkness of this life 
and so many spurres to prick us forward 
that we should not linger in so divine a voyage 
their fervent charity reprehendeth our lukewarmness 
their diligence in gods service 
our negligence 
their watching and praying 
our sluggishness and indevotion 
but above all we have the spotless example of our saviour christ for our imitation 
who most exactly fulfilled whatsoever was required of him 
whose life is a perfect patterne and samplar of all true holiness without the least blemish or imperfection 
twelfthly 
those who live in christs true catholike church 
by the communion of saints enjoy another mean to do well 
and that is the common prayers and supplications of the faithfull 
which beate continually at the gates of gods mercy 
and doubtless return not void again 
thirteenthly 
adjoyne hereunto the supernaturall providence of god 
which feedeth the fowles of the ayr 
and clotheth the lilies of the field 
who being so carefull of unreasonable creatures 
what shall we think he doth to the faithfull 
questionless 
he neither will sleep nor slumber that watcheth the house of israel 
he will keep his servants as the apple of his eye 
he will give them meat in due season 
he will finally sustaine their weakness 
erect them if they fall 
direct them if they erre 
succour them if they want 
refresh them in the heats of concupiscences 
mitigate the tempests of their temptations 
moderate the waves of wicked occasions 
fourteenthly
vertue of it self 
even naked 
if neither reward had been promised 
nor punishment threatned 
might sufficiently have moved us to love her 
and follow her 
because her internall beauty 
her grace and excellency 
her fruit and sweetness is such 
that her possession may be thought a sufficient remuneration 
what wise man doth not esteem goodness the greatest riches 
the best treasure 
the soundest credit 
philosophers did erre when they placed happiness in the possession of moral vertue 
but in that error was enwrapped a truth 
viz 
that true vertue was a rare and precious pearle 
divinity 
pure and excellent 
exceeding all delights that nature affordeth 
or art inventeth 
fifteenthly 
unto all these may be added 
the rare and precious promises that are made to them that follow after righteousness 
if god had onely terrified us from sinne with inexplicable paines 
every discreet man might have had sufficient cause to abhorre it 
but besides 
having invited us to vertue 
by promising ineffable joyes 
who can now excuse us 
what can we pretend 
with reward he pricks us forward 
with torments he draws us backward 
he bridles our wantonness with one 
and spurres on our slothfulness with the other
q 
is it not mercenary and servile to yeeld obedience to god 
being moved with hope of reward
a 
it is not 
for if the lord be pleased by such arguments and meanes to move and perswade us to obedience 
how can it be mercenary or servile if we be moved with it 
the gospel 
which is called the law of faith 
was given for our direction 
is the most perfect and compleat rule of lifejoh 
31618 
rom 
27 
heb 
1126 
but the gospel teacheth plainly 
that it is lawfull to obey god in hope of future reward
q 
wherein stands the sanctified exercise of the affections that decline or fly from their object
a 
in this that they shunne or decline all evil soundly 
orderly 
constantly according to the direction of gods word
q 
what reasons are there to fly and avoid that which is evil
a 
1 
the remorse of conscience 
which in the very act of sinning 
keepeth the watch of our souls 
adviseth us by barking 
that enemies are present 
and after that we have sinned 
how the wall is broken 
and consequently opened to the invasion of infernall thieves 
2 
the infamy and discredit which waiteth upon vice 
for 
such aversion all men by nature carry in their minds from sinne 
that no man can esteem in his heart 
or love truly any vitious man 
3 
all states and kingdoms ordered by laws 
and governed by reason 
appoint punishment for vices 
according to their qualities 
for what mean 
prisons 
stocks 
fetters 
gives 
racks 
gallows 
hatchets 
but to warn us that their creation was for sins extirpation 
4 
if there were a kings sonne of most beautifull countenance and divine aspect resembling his father as much as a sonne could do 
who would not judge this prince both inhumane and mad 
if he would cut mangle 
and disgrace his own face with grisly wounds 
and ugly formes 
what an injury were this against his father 
what an offence against all his parents 
even such cruelty use sinners to themselves and god 
because by sinning they deface that lively image of god 
according to which they were created and so are injurious not onely to themselves 
but also to their god 
their father 
their king 
5 
who spoileth gods temple 
is accounted irreligious 
who prophaneth his church 
is thought sacrilegious 
and who but he that hath lost all sparks of piety 
dare adventure to attempt so henious a crime 
yet the vitious adventure and performe it 
they prophane their bodies and souls 
they sell them to lust and wickedness 
they expell the holy ghost from them 
they put him forth of his just possession 
which he holdeth over them as a father by vertue 
and after by wicked deserts enforce him as a judge 
like prisoners 
to jayle them by justice 
6 
the horrible punishments mentioned in scriptues
inflicted for sinne 
even in this life 
if we had grace 
might drive us from sin 
for 
what cast adam out of paridise 
sinne 
what wounded him in nature 
and spoiled him of grace 
sinne 
what drowned the world 
sinne 
what rained fire and brimstone from heaven upon those infamous cities of sodome and gomorah 
sinne 
many examples more might be brought out of the old and new testament 
as deaths of private men and princes 
subversions of armies 
dispersions of countries 
mortality of thousands 
famine 
warres 
and plagues 
captivities 
and imprisonments 
for no other cause inflicted then wickedness and sinne 
but 
let us onely fix our eyes upon the sonne of god nayled upon the cross 
and we shall see how sinne mangled his body and afflicted his soul 
those nayls 
teares 
streames of blood 
exclamations 
gall 
and paines 
are monuments of sinne 
and memories of our wicked and perverse life 
7 
above all other evils incident to an evil life 
of great force to restrain our untoward affections from sin 
is the extream wrong we offer to god by it 
transgressing his law 
perverting his order 
disposition 
and providence 
injureing his infinite goodness 
which ought of all creatures to be beloved 
despising his majesty 
to which as to their last end 
all men ought to direct their actions 
and finally 
shewing our selves ungratefull to his love 
the which ought to be affected with all submission 
obedience and gratitude 
8 
what can more deterre men from wickedness 
then their own private loss 
or move them more to vertue then their own private gaine 
by vice our souls are spoiled of their riches 
their most precious robes 
and heavenly attyre 
by vertue they are apparelled 
by vice they are wounded to the very centre 
by vertue they are healed 
by vice they are impoverished 
by vertue enriched 
by vice they are defiled 
by vertue cleansed 
by vice they become dennes of devils 
by vertue seates of glory 
9 
sensible reasons want not to draw us from vice 
no day or houre passeth wherein appeareth not some silent sermon or real perswasion 
to avoid sinne and follow goodness 
do we not see daily men die 
is not death of the body caused by the death of the soul 
is it not an effect of adams disobedience 
whence proceed so many diseases 
plagues 
pestilences 
what first brought hunger and thirst 
paine and weariness 
sweat and labour 
what causes our daies to be so short 
and full of misery 
nothing but sinne and disobedience 
10 
wicked men do not onely by offences hurt themselves 
and injure the majesty of god 
but also they abuse his gifts and benefits 
like ungratefull debtors 
who oppugne their creditours with their own goods 
for 
the ungodly use that power of soul god gave them to love him 
to hate him 
that wit he bestowed upon them to meditate upon his law and commandements 
they pervert by thinking how to transgress them 
that heart he imparted to affect their neighbours in pure love and charity 
that they defile with malice and dishonesty 
that tongue he lent them to utter his praises 
that they blot with oathes and plasphemies 
those hands he framed as flowing conduits to feed the poor 
those are wholly imploied to avarice and rapine 
and to be brief 
the soul and body which ought to have been kept in holiness and sanctification 
they abuse to offend god with sinne and prevarication 
11 
all cretures which god created for the use of man 
and as servants attended upon him as their master 
all they 
i say 
exclaime against a vitious life 
they are so many trumpets 
which cease not to sound the abuses we offer them 
by offending their maker 
the sunne giveth light 
to work works of light 
and not to live in the shadow of darkness 
and so of the rest 
12 
the horrible paines of hell thundred in holy writ 
the weeping and gnashing of teeth 
the worme which will gnaw perpetually upon the very heart of the soul 
with remorse of conscience 
those inextinguible flames of infernall furnaces 
those remediless paines and torments without hope of recovery 
remission or mitigation 
and above all that privation and loss of the sight of the face of god 
prepared
for all those that would serve him in sanctity and holiness of life 
all these evils 
certainly to be incurred 
might sufficiently move any wise man to look about him 
what he doth 
whether he goeth 
what reckoning he must make 
for these be not may-games 
but sacred truths registred in scriptures 
daily put in execution 
hourely felt 
and of every wicked man to be proved
q 
is it not servile to forego sinne for fear of punishment
a 
the scripture expresly commandes the faithfullmat 
1028 
heb

to fear him who is able to cast soul and body into hell 
in which words is contained not onely a description of the person that is to be feared 
but also a reason 
why that person 
as a a judge and lord armed with that power 
is to to be feared 
as is manifest by the antithesis 
fear not them that can kill the body 
that is 
for fear of that death which they can inflict upon you 
do not commit those things which are acceptable to them 
displeasing to god 
but do that which is acceptable to god for fear of eternall death 
which he can and will inflict 
if to please men ye deny him as long as we live 
the law of faith 
established or ratified with promises of eternall life 
and comminations of eternall death 
doth continue 
but so long as the law of faith continueth 
so long continueth our obedience effected by meanes of the threatnings and promises 
for 
what arguments god useth to move us 
it is not absurd for us to be moved with them 
but god is pleased to use arguments drawn from comminations of eternall punishment 
again 
the reason of that positive obedience is one 
which is performed to some commandement 
and that freely 
and willingly 
another of that 
which floweth rather from some motion or force of nature 
then from the commandement of another and our choice and liberty 
for 
that obedience is best performed 
which is performed according to his will 
who gave the law 
but it is performed according to his will 
when any man performeth it moved with those arguments 
by which the sovereigne commander would have his law to be established 
nor is it servile to be moved to obedience for fear of eternall death 
but grudgingly 
unwillingly 
not freely to performe some externall acts of obedience 
if a man easily 
freely 
with propense will 
that is 
with all his heart and all his soul 
yeeld obedience to the commandement of his superiour 
with whatsoever argument he be moved to obey 
he is said to obey as a sonne 
not as a slave 
nevertheless 
the child of god is not distrustfully to fear falling into condemnation 
but so to fear it as to be warned against sinne 
which leadeth unto it 
he is to fear it as a thing which he is assured to escape 
but so as he must withall depart from iniquity 
the godly mans confidence in the promises of mercy 
is no greater then his care to walk in obedience 
his assurance to escape eternall death 
is answerable to his casting off the works of darkness 
so 
that fear of eternall wrath 
as it makes men fly from sinne 
may well stand with confident assurance of eternall happiness and finall perseverance
q 
if we have so many meanes 
so forcible 
so divine 
so continuall 
so supernaturall 
to serve god 
to follow vertue 
to fly sin 
what is the reason that we are so dull and untoward to good 
so forward to evil 
for one that doth well 
thousands do ill
a 
the main cause is original corruption 
whereby we are prone to evil 
slow to good 
but besides this 
we may adde these reasons 
1 
the lack of prudent meditation 
men miscarry so often in this perigrination 
through the want of good consideration 
because most of the meanes god hath vouchsafed to bestow upon us 
require a certain meditation and ponderation 
for 
they be like hot coales 
the which you may take in your hands 
and presently cast away without burning 
because all actions wel nigh require time or space for their operations but if you hold them a while 
you shall feel their effects 
so it
falleth forth in the mysteries of our faith 
he that meditateth 
burneth 
he that prefunctorily runneth over them 
scarce feeleth their heat 
meditation bloweth the coales by consideration 
whereunto followeth the flame of love and affection 
for otherwise what profit can we take of the inconstancy of our lives 
and certainty of our deaths 
of the severe and infallible judgment of god 
the inexplicable paines of hell 
the ineffable joys of heaven 
if we never consider them 
what availeth us to have the scriptures 
that god punished in this life so many with extraordinary deaths 
that by sinnes we are spoyled of grace 
wounded in nature 
dis-inabled to goodness 
and incited to illness 
if we never ruminate them in our minds 
or ponder them in our considerations 
questionless 
it were to swallow meat without chewing 
which rather endamageth bealth 
then restoreth the lost forces 
the second reason is ill education and wicked companyjer 
1323 
as it is impossible for the ethiopian to change his skin 
so is it for youth brought up licentiously to change their ill manners 
for use breedeth facility 
facility confirmeth nature 
nature strongly inclined 
can hardly be diverted from her common course 
but followeth her vitious determination 
again 
ill examples and ungodly conversation imprinted in tender years and weak souls 
take such root 
that hardly after they can be supplanted 
this we see by experience 
that as those speak with whom children converse 
purely 
or barbarously 
so children learn 
wherefore holy writ hath instructed us 
that as a man useth wise or foolish companyprov

1533 so he shall become himself wise or foolish 
a man therefore being brought up among wicked men 
for the most part accommodateth himself to their humours 
the reason is 
not onely 
because 
as men perswade by words 
so they do much more by deeds 
every action being a silent perswasion 
but also for that many examples 
i know not how 
come at length 
to breed such impressions in men 
that even vices seem vertues 
the third reason is present delectation 
for that we hope is future 
that pleasure worldlings perceive 
is present 
sensible pleasure feedeth the corporal substance of senses 
and therefore we easily perceive it 
but vertue affecteth the soul 
not after so palpable and gross manner 
and therefore despise it 
wherefore mens souls 
by inveterated customs used to sensuall and beastly delights 
either not believing 
or mistrusting 
or rather doubting of spirituall joys 
they neglect 
and for the most part care not for them 
contenting themselves with their present estatepsal

not looking any further 
and so as beasts they live 
and as beasts they die 
for 
since they see not by faith present 
those things which we expect by hope 
or abhorre by fear 
in the mean time the devill 
flesh and world 
delighting them with a present baite 
they neglect that they should expect 
and accept that they find next 
not unlike to children 
who preferre an apple before their inheritance 
for 
worldlings will be of the surer side 
they think it better to possess one bird in their hands 
then expect two in the fields 
to be sure of a present commodity 
then to be uncertain of a future gaine 
fourthly 
the lack of preservation hindereth our spirituall profit 
because our souls without prayer 
meditation 
the sacraments of the church 
exercise of vertue 
and works of piety 
those balmes which god has prepared as preservatives 
are soon infected with vices 
and stink with sinnes 
not unlike a dead body 
which for lack of a living soul daily falleth away by putrefaction 
looseth colour 
temperature 
all sweetness 
and becometh gastly 
loathsome and stinking 
if we be negligent in the meanes of grace 
remiss in the service of god 
inconstant in the pursuit of vertue 
no marvell if vice grow 
and our appetite to vertue decrease exceedingly
q 
let us briefly compare the means of vertue and the allurements to vice 
that it may the better appeare which are the more forcible and weighty
a 
1 
the devill by his suggestions allureth us to sinne 
he represents pleasures with a goodly shew 
propounds vertue as a most bitter object 
his
craft is wonderfull 
his malice extream 
his experience long 
his forces mighty 
his darts invisible 
but unto these inticements of satan 
we may oppose the inspirations of the holy spirit 
the admonitions of the word 
the readiness of the good angels to further us in the waies of holiness 
2 
by evil examples we are vehemently inticed to vice and wickedness 
but we have the express charge of god to walk in holiness 
which is more to be regarded then many examples of the wicked 
we have also the examples of christ and his apostles 
the prophets and saints daily preached 
besides the practises of many godly men living amongst us 
whom we see 
which cannot but countervaile the examples of men 
either void of reason or religion 
for 
who is he 
but either an atheist or a fool 
who will imitate anothers vices contrary to law 
conscience and reason 
onely because he seeth many do so 
3 
inconstancy 
whereby we become wonderfull various 
and fickle in our own estates 
exercises 
and manner of living 
is a great impediment to godliness 
but against this inconstancy may be opposed many meanes to goodness 
of greater force and efficacy 
the which can more constantly further us to goodness 
then inconstancy can incite to illness 
have we not registred in holy writ 
and sounding alwaies in our ears 
the inexplicable joys of heaven promised to the godly 
and the terrible paines of hell threatned to the ungodly 
will not the fear of gods judgment 
which hourely we attend 
enforce us to watch and pray 
lest we be taken at unawares 
may not the incertainty of our deaths 
move us to a constancy in life 
will not so many warnings of death 
judgment 
hell 
heaven 
so often inculcated 
sufficiently stirre us up to stand upon our ward 
cannot so many stayes of grace uphold and stay the inconstancy of nature 
how many are withholden from wickedness 
onely through terrour of temporall judgment 
and shall not so many terrours countervaile a fickle and inconstant inclination 
where lieth the anchor of hope 
and unmoveable grounds of faith and charity 
4 
sensuall pleasures work strongly upon the nature of man to draw it to vice 
but what are all these fading 
transitory pleasures 
which waver like wind 
quickly cloy 
sting like scorpions 
give no contentment 
what are they in comparison of that true peace 
divine 
solid 
pure 
permanent joy of the holy ghost 
that passeth understanding 
which god bestoweth upon them that fear him 
what to that pleasure 
comfort and contentment that issueth from vertuous actions 
but most of all 
what to the incomprehensible joys of heaven freely prepared for 
and certainly expected of them that follow righteousness 
5 
discontent with our estates is no small hinderance to the progress of vertue 
but those who attend indeed to serve god 
find a certain secret manna 
a paridise of consolations 
which will easily mitigate the crosses and discontentments ministred by a nature ill inclined 
for 
as god permitteth no evil to escape unpunished 
so he letteth pass no good unrewarded 
and although this reward shall be reaped in the harvest of eternall life 
yet with a quiet conscience 
the tranquillity of mind 
an internall peace and consolation in heavenly affairs 
he fully in this life recompenseth all disasters and calamities which occurre 
the crosses of this life should drive us to the practice of holiness 
because without godliness there is no contentment 
wealth cannot stay 
riches cannot satisfie the mind of man 
the pleasure of sinne is a deadly torment 
a continuall vexation unto the heart 
what then will quiet and content the soul 
nothing but true piety and godliness 
it is good to have the heart stayed 
or ballaced as it were 
with graceheb 
139 
not with meats 
that that must keep the ship stiffe and steady on the sea 
must not be leavers and shores without it 
but weight and ballast within it 
so 
that that must stay a mans raging and ranging desires 
must not be the outward supporting of his worldly estate 
but the inward ballacing and setling of the heart and mind 
that which gods grace alone can dopsal 
3716 
prov 
1516 
and in regard hereof it is that the psalmest saith 
that a small matter to the godly 
is much better then the
greatest wealth and riches 
that the ungodly or mighty hath or can have 
it is godliness then alone 
that can cause true contentment 
and that can cause true contentment alone 
godliness alone bringeth man home unto god 
out of whom true contentment cannot be had 
for 
the foul of man 
as it beareth the image of god 
so nothing can satisfie it 
but he whose image it beareth 
6 
many and great persecutions are raised against them that exercise themselves in well-doing 
which doth not a little hinder many from the practice of holiness 
but against the terrors of persecution sundry encouragments may be opposed 
first 
as he that guideth by his providence the sterne of mens souls 
permitteth them not to be moyled with tentations above the forces and abilities wherewith they are indued 
so likewise 
he will not see them so dejected with crosses 
that he will not errect them with consolations 
so said he 
who well had tried the passions of the cross 
for as the passions of christ abound in us 
even so by christ aboundeth our comfort2 cor

secondly 
if we weigh that the sunne setteth the same houre to him that passed the day in good works 
in fasting and prayer 
as to him which viciously spent it in feasting and play 
we shall perceive how vain fancies 
and voluble crosses vanish away as little clouds before the northerne winds 
thirdly 
the troubles of this life are nothing in comparison of the eternity of pleasures 
provided and kept in store for them that with patience continue in well-doing 
worldly men will lay out money before hand for great advantage 
and shall not we adventure our goods 
honour 
liberty and life in the cause of god 
for an incorruptible crown of glory 
it is the best traffick to part with all that we have 
even life it self for christ his sake 
for 
they that forsake all for the truth and gospel 
shall reape a thousand-fold more in this life 
and in the world to come eternall glory 
7 
negligence in serving god 
or seeking meanes how to come to our end 
is a great impediment of vertue 
when matters of honor 
pleasure or profit are sought with double diligence 
but against this poyson we have divers remedies 
and cures of vertue to heale these sores of vice 
for 
consider but with thy self 
that notable parable and palpable reason taught us by christ 
and proved by continuall experience 
when the rich man hath massed up his treasures with hook and crook 
moyling and toyling 
when he thinketh to enjoy 
loe 
a voice cometh 
thou fool 
this night shall they fetch thy soul from thee 
and then whose shall all these things be 
and doubtless 
if men were wise 
the continuall fear of death might enforce them to condemn such a drudging life 
besides 
if all creatures by the instinct of nature 
endeavour so much to winne their full and compleat perfection 
why should we degenerate so farre from our own nature 
as not to accomplish that we lack 
mark but the seed cast in to the ground 
how it laboureth to die 
after to live 
how it fixeth his roots 
pierceth the ground to enjoy the sunne and ayr 
erecteth the stem 
springs and husks 
issues the ear 
yeelds with the winde 
and never gives over till corne be brought to a full maturity 
we see how new wines 
beer 
and all liquors work 
by boyling the rawer parts 
expelling the dregs 
reducing themselves to a due temper 
proportionated mixture and perfection 
if these insensible creatures so industriously labour to come to their end 
shall not we endeavour to atchieve our end 
and perfection 
and felicity 
if they according to their small ability imploy their naturall talents 
why should not we endued with so many graces 
procure our own spirituall good and welfare 
all things naturally move to their center or place of rest 
and so much the swifter 
as they come nearer unto it 
you cannot hold a stone in the ayr 
but it will fall down 
and its motion will be more speedy in the end then in the beginning heaven is the habitation and resting place of the soul 
it cannot be quiet till it come thither 
from whence it camerom 
31 and should not we covet happiness and perfection with the more earnestness 
as we come nearer unto salvation 
why standeth god at the
doors of our heart beating 
but to inter in 
why do gods servants cry out upon our negligence 
but to bring us to diligenceapoc 320 
why doth god punish many in the prime of their years 
in the fat of their fortunejer 
2534 
in the glory of their prosperity 
but to advertise us by their examples of the inconstancy of this world 
and that we might learn to be wise by their losses 
to be vigilant and carefull by their carelessness 
8 
the flesh molesteth us in the service of god 
with an army of unruly sensuall passions 
for the most part withdrawing from goodness 
and haling to illness 
they toss and turmoile our miserable souls 
as tempests and waves the ocean sea 
which never standeth quiet 
our souls are puffed up with self-love 
shaken with fear 
now flowing with concupiscences and desires 
and presently ebbing with desperation and sadness 
joy altereth the mind 
and ire tyrannizeth and consumeth both body and mind 
against the garboile of these tumultuous passions 
we may oppose the barking 
biting and gnawing of a wounded conscience 
which waiteth continually upon inordinate passions 
also we may oppose the law of nature 
the brevity of all pleasures 
for no passion can long content the mind 
but even a gust of pleasure gulleth the soul 
and so cloyeth it 
that the very dainties seem loathsome 
hereunto may be added 
the infamy and disgrace 
which commonly accompanieth exorbitant passions 
what gaine we by fulfilling passions and giving way to lusts 
when the account is cast 
nothing is gotten but this 
that we have changed our condition 
and are become bruitish 
the beasts of the field enjoy sensuall delights in common with man 
and if we hunt after none but these 
be contented to loose spirituall comforts to possess them 
do we not make our selves worse then bruitcreatures 
in that we degenerate from our kind 
and conforme unto them 
lastly 
passions are set in subjection to the will 
which is the commander of the outward man 
that they cannot draw us to evil 
unless we yeeld unto them 
they may stirre and rebell against reason 
but cannot prevaile to the committing of evil 
if the will consent not 
9 
the many occasions offer'd daily to do ill 
the great readiness of matter and favourers thereof 
are main impediments of vertue 
furtherances of vice 
the world is full of allurements 
the occasions of sinne are ever at hand 
and multitudes are ready to tempt and perswade unto wickedness 
but if the matter be well weighed 
we have many motives and means to do good 
more then occasions to do ill 
as appears by that which hath been said before 
compare the occasions of sinne 
with the causes and reasons why thou shouldst eschew evil 
and follow that which is good 
to wit 
the law of god 
the light of nature 
the peace of conscience 
the joys of heaven 
the torments of hell 
the manifold blessings that accompany well-doing 
the sundry crosses 
afflictions 
evils 
disgraces that pursue the sinner and ungodly 
and upon little consideration it will be most evident 
that the means of good are most weighty and forcible 
there be many that perswade to evil 
some 
though few in comparison that counsell to good 
but the advice of one that teacheth or informeth what is just and upright 
is to be preferred before the suggestions of many thousands that would allure to evil 
for 
the force of perswasion depends upon the truth and soundness of reasons alledged 
not the multitude of voices 
but truth favours them 
that undertake the maintenance of piety 
and exhort others to the practice of it 
they use deceit that would allure unto sinne 
whatprov 
2424 
that the works of darkness bring infamy and disgrace 
even in the judgment of them that sollicit unto it 
the inciters unto sinne 
cannot but disregard them 
that consent unto their counsell
q what are the kinds of affections
a 
of affections some are intellectuall 
others sensuall 
that there are some affections in the highest 
and chiefest part of the soul 
cannot be doubted 
for 
to god the scriptures ascribe love 
hate 
ire 
zeal 
who cannot be subject to
any sensitive aberrations 
and therefore 
as in him they are perfections 
and we are commanded 
and may imitate him in them 
there is no reason why they should be denied unto us 
in such sort as they be perfect 
and that is principally in the intellectuall power of the soul 
besides 
we know most certainly 
that our sensitive appetite cannot love 
hate 
fear 
hope 
&ampc 
but what by imagination or sensitive apprehension may be conceived 
for 
we may love an ill thing 
but we cannot love an unknown thing 
now experience teacheth us that men do fear the judgments of god 
they love him 
and hope in him 
they hate sinne 
and exercise many notable affections which reason prescribeth 
and whereunto the sensitive apprehension ascendeth not 
finally 
as our wit understandeth whatsoever our senses perceive 
even so our will may affect whatsoever our passions do follow 
for 
as the object of the wit is all truth 
real or apparent 
so the object of our will is all goodness indeed 
or carrying the gloss thereof 
but these affections which reside in the reasonable part or power of the soul 
differ much in nature and quality from those that inhabite the inferiour parts of the soul 
because 
these being bred and born in the highest part of the soul 
are immateriall 
spirituall 
independant of any corporall subject 
but those of the sensitive appetite are materiall 
corporall 
and depending upon some bodily instruments
q 
how may it appear that these passions 
specially the sensitive 
are not to be abandoned 
but onely moderated according to the rule of reason and faith
a 
1 
vertue never ruines that which is wholly conformable to reason 
but what is more reasonable then to see a man moved with pity and compassion of his like 
of his friends 
or of his kinsman 
what inhumanity were it for a mother to see her child in the throat of wild a beast 
or exposed to ship-wrack 
or broken upon a wheele 
or torn in pieces by tortures 
or only sick of some violent infirmity 
and not to have her soul sensible of grief 
would we that a vertuous man should not be touched with indignation to see crimes honoured 
and the wicked advanced to the height of dignities 
these motions being so just 
were it not a great cruelty to seek to suppress them 
as it were 
in despight of nature 
2 
to apprehend evil 
to fear punishments 
to attend recompences with joy 
to long after promises 
are they not so many incouragements to piety 
temperance 
and other vertuous actions 
who is it then 
that will blame so commendable a thing 
nay 
is it not to quench the fruits of vertue 
and to deny it the content which is due unto it 
in enting off thus generally all passions 
for 
who knoweth not 
that she doth usually plant in the souls of men an ardent love of the goodly fruits which she produceth 
what just man but feels a certain pleasure and sweetness in the effects of justice 
what sober man but receives content in the actions of sobriety 
3 
who doth not know but the passions of our souls are the objects of many excellent vertues 
which do moderate them 
and reduce them unto reason 
when they seek to fly out 
fortitude is nothing but a mediocrity betwixt fear and hardiness 
that is to say 
it is nothing but a vertue by meanes whereof we do moderate our exceeding fear 
and our immoderate boldness 
the like may be said of courage 
patience 
perseverance 
modesty 
honesty 
temperance 
and divers others 
4 
the sensitive appetite is a present of nature 
which god hath freely bestowed upon us 
but vertue never destroyes nature 
but adds unto it the perfection which it wants 
it must then suffer the sensitive appetite to act according to his inclination 
yet moderating his motions 
and restraining them under the laws of reason 
for 
as health doth not consist in the ruine of contrary qualities which are found in man 
but in the temperature which a good constitution gives them 
and 
as to make a perfect musique 
we must not take away the diversity of tunes 
but reduce them to a good accord to
make the harmony perfect 
so the strivings of vertue consist not wholly to root all naturall passions out of the soul 
but to moderate and governe them by the rule of reason 
5 
passions 
if they grow inordinate 
be infirmities of the soul 
but if they submit to reason and the laws of faith 
they are instruments and objects of vertue 
the armes of reason 
and as it were lively sparks which inflame desires in our souls
chap 
iii 
wherein the holy exercise of love consists 
and why it is to be rightly ordered 
the means or motives whereby love may be stirred up 
what those exercises of love are that must be shunned 
of the marks or signes of love
question 
let us now come to the sanctified use of some affections in particular 
and first to begin with love 
which is the prime and chief affection intellectuall or sensuall 
wherein standeth the holy exercise of it
a 
in that it followeth the motions of faith 
and being ruled by the light of truth 
doth imbrace all good soundly 
constantly 
and in an uniforme order according to the law of god
q 
why is love to be rightly ordered
a 
1 
when this passion contains it self within the bounds of honesty 
it is a lively spring and fountain of all good things in the life of man 
but when like a wild and untamed beast it exceeds the bounds of reason and limits of truth 
there is no misery which it brings not into the world 
nor any disorder which it causeth not in our lives 
it is as it were a fatall source 
from whence flow all kinds of horror 
uncleanness 
adulteries 
incests 
sacriledges 
quarrels 
warres 
treasons 
murders 
parricides 
cruelties 
and violences 
besides 
the particular torments it gives unto the souls of such as give themselves to be surprized 
filling them with envies 
jealousies 
cares 
terrors 
yea and madness 
drawing them many times to despair 
and to do things whereat heaven and earth blush and are ashamed 
2 
love prescribes a law to our other desires 
and to all our other passions 
so 
as we may terme it the key and beginning of our thoughts 
of our words 
of our actions 
and of whatsoever we do in this life 
so it makes the first impression in our souls 
where it excites the desire of that which we resolve to pursue 
and then it fortifies this desire by hope 
which inflames us to the pursuite of that we desire 
and if there appear any difficulty 
it hath no rest 
untill it hath vanquished and surmounted all lets 
wherein she settles her contentment and rest 
3 
love hath an uniting vertue 
by meanes whereof it causeth him that loveth to aspire to unite himself to the thing beloved 
they which love 
said aristophanes 
would passionately desire to be transformed 
and changed one into another 
and of two bodies to become one 
but for that 
this transformation cannot be without the destruction of their being 
they strive to recompense this defect 
by a civil and honest union 
which tends not to the ruine of their nature 
but contents their affections 
that is to say 
they converse continually together 
entertain their passions 
and are as little absent as may be one from another 
moreover 
they have the same thoughts 
the same desires 
the same affections 
the same wils 
the same delights 
and the same distasts 
and seem to be but one soul in two bodies 
so 
as that which is pleasing to him that loveth 
is in like manner to the party beloved 
what he affects the other embraceth 
and what he rejects the other flies 
and doth abhorre 
so 
as their
wils being thus strictly united 
all their actions and carriages conspire to the same end 
and propound unto themselves the same object 
for 
love is a desire to enjoy the good we propound unto our selves 
as proper for our content 
and capable to make us in some sort better by the fruition 
but this enjoying and participation cannot be effected but by uniting the object to our affection 
which is the same good we propound unto our selves 
wherefore it is the essence of love that it produceth this union 
4 
love causeth the soul of him that loveth 
to be more where it loves 
then where it lives 
the reason is 
for 
that the souls of such as love 
are perpetually attentive to contemplate the image of that they love 
and have no other thought nor greater pleasure then that they receive by this sweet entertainment 
by reason whereof the soul making shew of a more exact presence 
where it doth most frequently work 
it followes thereby that it is more with the party beloved 
then in its own body 
for these reasons it followeth 
that love 
if it be not rightly ordered 
will draw the heart to vanity 
but being truly directed 
doth most sweetly linke and unite the soul unto god 
if love be not set upon god as it ought 
we must necessarily stand guilty of spirituall adultery 
because the heart is withdrawn from the chief good by some carnall or base pleasure
q 
what are the meanes or motives whereby love may be stirred up in us
a 
the meanes or motives to stirre up love are many 
as we will shew in one particular branch 
sc 
the love of god 
which may be applied to other things 
as occasion is offered
parentage1 
we love our parents as authors of our being 
and imparters of life 
and this without teacher by nature we are instructed 
but there is a very small spark of paternity in our progenitors 
compared to god 
he gave them bodies 
being and life to be parents 
he preserved 
conserved and enabled them 
he created our souls alone 
wherein they neither had part nor action 
he formed our bodies 
when they never minded us 
he kept us day and night 
when they never remembred us 
yea 
when both they and we were fast asleep 
his watchfull eye waked over both them and us
benevolence2 
in the progress of our tender years 
we love them who bestow favours and benefits upon us 
but if we consider the meat we eat 
the cloths we wear 
the ayr we breath 
the senses we use 
the life we enjoy 
the wit wherewith we reason 
the will wherewith we affect 
all are gods daily gifts 
hourely 
momently 
yea 
instantly by his provident hand upheld and maintained 
of all benefactors he is the best 
and worthily deserves to be loved most 
in every instant we wholly in body and soul 
life and being 
depend upon him and in every instant 
if it were possible 
we should consecrate our selves intirely 
with most gratefull recognition and remonstrance of his benefits bestowed upon us
excelency3 
the excellency and worth of men famous for courage 
justice 
wisdom 
or piety 
enforceth a reverent affection towards them 
and men count it an honour to be admitted into society with them 
but 
what is the worthiness of man 
compared with infinite surpassing glory and perfection of god 
what hath their power to do with his omnipotency 
their base excellency with his supream majesty 
their prudence 
policy 
stratagems 
with his infinite wisdom 
and incomprehensible counsels 
as the high pitch of mans preheminency is vile vassaladge compared to the sovereignty and blessedness of god 
so his love should disdain not onely to be equalled 
but also conferred with theirs
beauty4 
many men are ravished with beauty 
in such sort that their hearts are more present in thoughts and desires with such bodies as they liked and loved 
then with that body wherein they sojourned and lived 
but that beauty of the
lord transcendeth this gross 
terrene 
massie 
corruptible beauty 
more then all the world 
the least graine of sand which lyeth upon the ocean shore 
for 
his harmony 
consort 
and proportion 
springeth from the admirable union of all his perfections 
the beauty of any or all the creatures is infinite 
as they are of limited essence 
of god most finite 
as he is boundless in himself
5 
bountybounty 
humility and goodness 
are principall motives of love 
all beasts 
though reasonless 
yet in love 
follow this generall instinct and inclination of reason 
imprinted in their hearts with the indeleble characters of divine providence 
to affect nothing but that in some sort concerneth their good 
but god is good of himself 
essentially 
without list or limit 
all things else by limitation and participation 
an angel hath goodness 
and therefore is amiable 
yet he is but a drop distilled from god 
in that quantity 
degree 
and measure his wisdom prescribed 
and his limited nature required 
as god is good in himself 
so is he to his creatures 
the lord is good to them that fear him 
to them that hope in his mercy 
how good is the god of israel to them that be pure in heart 
how bountifull and humble 
that he disdaines not the signification of our affection towards him 
nay 
his goodness reacheth to all things that he hath made 
what man ever lived and enjoyed not the heat and light of this visible sunne 
or who ever lived or continued life 
but by the beames of god his invisible bounty
6 
beasts and men are carried with an unsatiable desire of delightdelight 
as daily experience testifies 
but god is the paradise of pleasure 
the delight of delights 
in his presence there is fulness of joy for evermore 
nor are all the treasures of spirituall 
honest 
vertuous 
supernaturall 
divine pleasures reserved for the saints in heaven 
but even in this barren wilderness 
in this troublesome world 
god refresheth his servants with spirituall manna and sweet streams of consolation 
for 
what are those admirable comforts which the faithfull feel in the inundation of their adversities 
endured for the truth 
but as rivers of water in a drie ground 
what signifie those secret joys 
which proceed from a good conscience grounded upon a confident hope of future salvation 
but those great clusters of grapes shewed unto them 
in signe of the fertility of the future land of promise 
what else can the sweetness of fervent prayers prognosticate 
but the infinite suavity and happy contentation 
which once fervent believing lovers shall enjoy in blessed fellowship and communion with god
7 
all men love profitprofit 
and that best which they judge most profitable 
but god is the inexhausted treasure of all goodness 
the end of all profits and commodities

nor himself 
god is the root 
fountain

profitable in all

the supream perfection of all goodness 
dignity and majesty 
which are as farre above the pitch of all excellent vertues 
heroicall 
supernaturall 
or theologicall 
and infinitely more 
then the chiefest vertues 
surmount the baddest vices 
all men by nature are sinners

as farre from all sinne 
as incomprehensible wisdom from ignorance 
and infinite goodness from malice

it is of his love that we live 
that we are preserved 
it is of love

adopted to be his sonnes 
great is thy love 
o god 
to men in this life 
for here thou dost not onely affect them 
poure out thy benefits upon them 
distill thy graces into their hearts 
and a thousand waies externally and internally work their salvation 
but also that which surpasseth all 
it seemeth thy will and power are at the command 
or rather ready to obey the desires of thy faithfull servants 
and if in this life 
such be the puissance of love 
what shall we conceive of that love 
wherewith the saints in glory are affected and embraced 
it passeth all that heart can conceive 
or tongue express
union10 
union breedeth love 
and the stricter this union is 
the stricter affection it engendreth 
but every christian is most strictly united unto god 
and soundly renewed after his image
agreeableness11 
the lord is the onely fit object of absolute love 
and hath the most agreeableness with a reasonable nature 
for 
he is the prime truth in being and speaking 
and infinite in both 
the chief good 
the only object of compleat contentation 
who can explicate the admirable proportion 
conveniency 
and agreeableness betwixt his mercies and our miseries 
his riches and our poverty 
his abilities to perfect us 
and our indignities to be perfected 
his patience and long-suffering to support injuries 
and our perversness to commit offences
necessity12 
pleasant arts 
delightfull creatures 
complementall ornaments be greatly loved and liked 
necessary trades 
creatures 
and parts much more 
because every one first loveth himself 
and then all those meanes 
which in some sort concerne the being or conservation of himself 
among which those that are most necessary have preheminence 
but in all things we have dependance upon god 
whose aide is as necessary to the preservation of our being 
as to the first imparting of it 
if he uphold not the weak pillars of our bodies 
they presently fall and come to nothing 
such and so extream is their feebleness 
that no hand 
but his almighty is able to sustain them 
what way can we walk 
what sense can we use 
what work can we work 
what word can we speak 
what thought can we think 
what wish can we will 
if he guide not our feet 
concurre not with our senses 
work not with our hands 
direct not our tongues 
manage not our wit 
move not our will
pardoning wrongs13 
the passing by and pardoning of injuries without intendment or meditation of reveng 
doth much ravish and affect the heart 
herein none is to be compared unto our god 
who freely pardoneth iniquity 
transgression and sinne 
who can recount the wrongs that are done unto his highness every day 
by disobedience to his commandements 
contempt of his mercy 
abuse of his long-suffering 
and yet no sooner do we cry 
i have sinned 
but he forgiveth our transgressions 
with invincible patience he expecteth our repentance 
and by internall favours and externall benefits cherishes us 
as though he were not offended
deliverance14 
our affections are strong to them that have delivered us out of danger 
and stand to us in the times of trouble and distress 
and have suffered many wrongs 
injuries 
disgraces for us 
in this respect we owe unto god 
he may challenge from us the most tender love 
what paines hath christ suffered in soul and body 
to rid us from eternall torment of soul and body deserved by sinne
manner of giving15 
the manner of giving gifts or bestowing favours do much augment love 
which are to be considered in respect of the giver 
if he be great and excellent 
a
stranger 
our friend 
an enemy 
in respect of the gift 
if exceeding great in it self 
if marvellous dear to the giver 
if common to many 
in respect of the receiver 
if it tend to his great good 
or riddance from some great evil 
if in giving he be singled from the rest 
in respect of the manner of giving 
if with alacrity 
if without suite or request 
if with vehement affection 
if without interest 
if with the danger and damage of the giver 
most of these circumstances may be observed in the gifts 
which god vouchsafeth 
specially in that gift of gifts 
christ jesus 
his onely begotten sonne 
whom he gave to die for us

what are the exercises of love that must be shunned
a 
1 
blind love 
when vain devises and conceits are affected contrary to the direction 
or at least without the warrant of the word 
this affection is ill guided 
because it is not led by truth 
and wrong placed 
because the thing beloved can give no easeisa

carnall love 
when wealth 
health 
honour 
pleasure 
friendship 
ease and life are more affected then honesty 
vertue 
piety 
and the favour of god 
to which heads must be referred 
the corrupt affection of them who will not adventure the loss of their friends 
favour and good-will 
to performe some necessary duty unto their souls1 tim

the love of money and so of pleasure is the root of all evil

the love of sinne is a notorious abuse of that affection 
the mind erreth 
when it is deluded with falshood 
the heart is perverted 
when it embraceth evil for good 
sinne deformeth 
corrupteth 
troubleth the soul 
but all good desires tend to the good and perfection of it in some kind 
it is a sign we love not our neighbour 
when we suffer sinne to rest upon him 
4 
love not uniforme or disordered 
when the least duties are earnestly affected 
but not the greater with answerable vehemency and freeness of spirit 
love is mishapen 
if it be not proportionable to the excellency of her object 
5 
partiall love 
which argueth more indulgence to the corrupt disposition of heart 
then power of grace when such duties are affected 
as cross not 
but rather further our main designes and projects 
whereas no less necessary 
profitable 
excellent 
and well-pleasing are disregarded 
because they sute not with our inclination 
love is not fashioned according to its true and proper samplar 
nor moved by sound and lively faith 
if in motion it be not uniforme and universall 
orderly and totall 
proportionable 
and generall 
6 
inconstant love 
whose immediate and proper cause is want of soundness 
constant friendship is in most request with men 
as for them that are in and out 
off and on 
now pleased 
anon displeased 
they are not respected of any 
unless it it be for their own ends 
will god entertain them into his service 
that upon every occasion of offence taken 
for none can be given 
are ready to cast off his service
q 
what are the signes of love
a 
1 
sorrow and joy are the marks of our affections 
and of that we have in the soul 
which rejoyceth or afflicts it self 
as the objects which present themselves are pleasing or distastefull 
if we grieve at the free passage of the gospel 
or to see the prosperity of them that fear god 
without question we love that which is evil 
if we rejoyce in the misery of godly men 
the overspreading of prophanness 
the decay of truth 
it will not be hard to judge what affection beares sway 
2 
friends share equally betwixt them the good and evil 
there is such a bond of affection betwixt friends 
as the harme which happens to the one 
afflicts the other 
and fils him with bitterness 
so 
as many times we have seen true friends die with sorrow 
for the loss of their friend 
yea 
prophane histories are full of persons 
which have slaine themselves 
for
that they would not survive them whom they have loved dearly 
in like manner the prosperity of friends passeth from one to another 
so as the triumphs of alexander 
are the contentments of ephestion 
and the glory of ephestion 
is the joy of alexander 
3 
they which love have the same friends 
and the same enemies 
they say the adamant or loadstone doth not onely make an impression upon iron which it draws 
but doth also impart his vertue by his touching 
so 
as the iron which it hath toucht 
draws other iron unto it 
and makes as it were a continuall chaine 
in the same manner 
a friend brings his friends to him he loves 
and he reciprocally imparts unto him his friends 
whereof there is framed a common bond 
which makes them ready to succour one another 
as if they were members of one body 
hence is that proverb 
how can he love me 
who loves not them that i love 
4 
thoughts and words are signes of love 
for love desiring union with the thing beloved 
carrieth the thoughts where it would be 
and so becomes present in heart with that 
from which it is severed by distance of place 
where our treasure is 
there will our heart be also 
mat 
621 
if our cogitations 
studies 
cares 
desires 
and appetite be to earthly treasures 
our love is carried to things below 
but if our thoughts be lifted to heaven 
our treasure is above 
5 
men testifie 
that they love those before whom they are ashamed to do or say those things which of themselves are shamefull or dishonest 
wherein the persians gave good testimony of their love to their wives 
when as they caused them to retire from their banquets 
being unwilling that their eyes should be spectators of their excess 
for this respect and reverence which they gave them 
was a sign of true love 
for that we are ashamed to commit any unworthy act before them we affect 
6 
by our company we may try our affection 
for men cannot but affect their manners 
with whom they delight to converse familiarly 
likeness of manners causeth agreement amongst men 
one wicked man loveth another for his sinnes sake 
and is the more willing and desirous of his company for his lewd conditions 
but goodness 
even such as is approved of god 
and pleasing to good men 
doth unite the minds of those which are godly 
and maketh them loving and kind to each other 
this caused jonathan so earnestly to set his affection upon david 
and to have him in such estimation 
because he saw him to be full of grace and valour 
as himself was also 
and this caused david likewise so gladly to entertain the love of jonathan with constant care to requite the same unto him 
and his posterity 
7 
our affection is discovered by looks and gestures 
the eyes are as glass-windows 
in and through which do shine the motions of the heart 
in the countenance 
we may read what men desire 
the affections have such affinity with the senses in their motions 
that it is hard to hide them so at all times 
that they shall not appeare to such as do observe us

sincerely 
constantly turneth from all known evil with detestation 
according to the nature and degree of evil 
as good is the object of love 
so 
evil is the object of hatred 
to understand this 
we must remember 
that whether it be in the mind 
or in the body 
there is a befitting estate and sweet harmony 
which makes us to abhorre that which may dissolve this consort 
this harmony considered in the body 
is no other thing then the good constitution 
by meanes whereof we enjoy perfect health 
the which being impaired 
our nature receives paine 
as when we endure great hunger and thirst 
or when we receive any hurt or wound 
as for the soul 
this same harmony may be considered 
first in the senses 
as well externall as internall 
and consisteth in the proportion they have with their objects 
which is such 
as they hate whatsoever puls them away 
or which divert them by any kind of violence 
as for example the eyes hate darkness and obscurity 
and our imagination is terrified 
and troubled by the fearfull apprehensions of dreames 
which it frameth during our rest 
the same harmony considered in reason 
either it regards the simple knowledge of the truth 
which our understanding conceives with pleasure 
or the use and execution of things which depend on wisdom 
which we do with content 
in regard of the first 
our spirit is enemy to lying 
although at some times it takes delight in the art wherewith they colour a thing to give it some shew of truth 
and as for the second 
there is such diversity of judgment in humane actions which are as it were the element of prudenee 
as it is a thing in a manner incredible as for that which concernes the will 
her harmony consists in the proportion and love which she beares to the good 
which makes her detest and abhorre whatsoever presents it self unto her 
under the shew of evil 
as pernicious and hurtfull to her content and rest 
the harmony of the sensitive appetite consists in the familiarity and concurrence it hath with the good of the senses 
which causes it to abhorre whatsoever shall offend them 
as whips 
tortures 
punishments 
hunger 
thirst 
wounds 
and such like 
the harmony of the intellectuall affections consists in the familiarity and concurrence 
they have with the good of the mind and will 
which causeth an irreconcileable hatred to those things which the mind apprehendeth as spiritually evil 
and the will renounceth as hurtfull to her spirituall estate 
now when hatred is moved truely according to the direction of sound judgment 
and abhorreth all evil according to the nature and degrees thereof 
sc 
that most 
which is most opposite to spirituall happiness and contentment 
and others as they have reference unto it 
then is it exercised as it ought to be 
it is here to be considered 
that divines and morall philosophers distinguish two sorts of hatred 
the one they call hatred of abhomination 
the other hatred of enmity 
for as in love
we affect the person and wish him well 
so in hatred of enmity 
we detest the person 
and wish him evil 
as if i love my friend 
i wish him health 
wealth and prosperity 
if the judge hate the thief 
he wisheth him the gallowes 
but in this they differ 
that love respecteth both the person and the good desired 
and is intire and compleat 
but hatred detesteth the malefactor 
loveth the punishment as an evil deserved by the offendor 
contrariwise 
as in hatred of enmity 
the person stained with vice moveth me to detest him 
so in hatred of abhomination 
for the love i bare any person 
i hate all evils which may befall him 
for example 
a man loveth his child 
and therefore abhorreth death as evil of the child 
a just man god 
and therefore detesteth sinne 
as an injury done to god 
a man loveth his own health 
and therefore hateth diseases 
or what else may cross his health 
so that here we have three things 
hatred of evil in respect of the person we love 
love of evil 
in respect of the person we hate 
hatred and love combined in one respect of perfect enmity and compleat hatred
q 
why is the sanctified exercise of hatred necessary
a 
1 
this passion was ingraft in us by nature 
to the end that at the first approach 
at the first taste and imagination of evil 
we may retire our selves 
and fly it 
lest we runne into ruine 
2 
hatred of evil 
is a preservative against allurements and temptationsmat 
624 
the world is full of baits 
whereby satan endeavoureth to catch and ensnare us 
but so long as the hatred of sinne doth burne in our breasts 
his practises shall take none effect to hurt us 
as he shall lay ginnes to entrap 
we shall be circumspect to decline his malice 
3 
the most universall 
the most operative 
and the most durable passions of the soul 
are love and hatred 
they spread farthest 
they pierce deepest 
they last longest 
and therefore great cause we should look to the right ordering of them 
4 
no perswasions can move 
no examples draw 
nor difficulties compell men to embrace what is evil 
if there hearts be carried with a true hatred and detestation of it 
for 
as likeness is the cause of love 
and that 
of union 
so dissimilitude is the cause of hatred 
and that again 
of separation 
that which we hate 
we suffer not to come 
or at least not to abide near us 
but either we remove it from us 
or our selves from it 
if we hate vanity more then affliction 
and judge the evil of sinne more hurtfull then outward misery 
we shall not entertain sinne 
to escape the lesser danger 
i hate the works of them that fall away 
it shall not cleave unto me 
psal 
1013 
the latter is an effect of the former 
for what we hate in others 
we cannot embrace and entertain in our selves

v 
love is the fountain of hatred 
and in what measure we love truth 
we hate falshood 
to love good and hate the opposite evil in the same kind 
are inseparably linked 
if our soul thirst after god as a drie land where no water is 
if his favour be better unto us then life it self 
it cannot be 
but our hatred must answer in proportion to that which is opposite to gods law 
and derogatory to his glory 
and from hence it followes 
that love and hatred are so conjoyned 
that if both be not ordered aright 
neither is exercised as it ought
q 
how may this hatred be stirred up in us
a 
to move this hatred 
two things specially are diligently to be observed 
first 
the person beloved 
and all those reasons which may stirre up his love 
then the hurt of the evil 
and all the harms it bringeth with it 
for example 
we ought for the love of our souls 
and the souls of our neighbours 
detest and abhorre sinne and the offence of god 
now all those inducements which move us to love our soulslev 
1917 
strike in our hearts a horrour of sinne
which is the death and destruction of souls 
and all those reasons which shew the deformity of sin 
stirre up a detestation thereof 
the general motives alledged above 
applied to this particular 
wlll suffice to perswade us to love our souls 
the nature and harms consequent unto sinne and all other evils 
may be gathered out of the holy scriptures 
and from christian experience

carnall hatred 
secret or manifest 
when we hate our enemies that have some way wronged us in word 
or deed 
the effect whereof is 
contention 
upon the renewing of the memory of former faults 
now buried in forgetfulness 
or the upbraiding of secret sinnes 
3 
wicked 
bruitish

when we hate good

5 
partiall hatred 
when some sinnes are hated 
but others liked and practised 
as the angel of the church of ephesus hated the deeds of the nicolaitans 
when he inclined to luke-warmness 
many men detest theft 
that love covetousness 
abhorre whoredom 
that like irreligiousness 
6 
sleight disordered hatred 
when dislike of sinne is subordinate to our worldly projects 
pleasures 
or matters of commodity 
which causeth that it is neither sound 
set against sinne because god condemneth it 
nor uniforme 
rising in detestation according to the nature of the offence 
nor constant without flitting or starting 
to this head is referred 
the affection that men bare to their friends 
when they will not adventure the loss of their favour 
to rid their souls from sinne
q 
who are most subject to this disordered passion
a 
1 
faint and base minds are sooner moved then generous spirits 
the reason is 
for that cowards fear every thing 
so as their hatred is inflamed against all such as they think may hurt them 
be it in their person 
in their goods 
or in regard of their friends 
hence it is that great men which have no courage are commonly cruell 
2 
the proud and envious are also subject to the motions of hatred 
the first 
for that they think they are not honoured as they should 
or should be debased more then is fit by the practice of obedience 
the latter 
for that all the prosperities of their equals offend them 
3 
they that love themselves too much 
are wonderfull apt to the same motions 
for that they take every thing as an injury 
and are so nice as they cannot endure to be crossed

v 
why the affection of pleasure or delight is to be exercised aright 
of the delights of faith and reason 
and of sense 
rules for the right ordering of delight 
how this affection is stirred up 
with the effects thereof
question 
why is the affection of pleasure or delight to be exercised aright
a 
by that which already hath been said 
we may easily perceive wherein the sanctified exercise of the affections doth consist 
and how they may be discerned 
therefore it is needless to repeate it any more 
it shall suffice briefly to shew for what singular reasons some other affections must be rightly ordered 
and what is specially to be observed therein 
touching pleasure or delight it is holily to be exercised 
because all the passions of our souls depend upon pleasure and paine 
which grow from the contentment or distast which we receive from the divers objects which present themselves unto us in the course of this life 
if we love 
it is for that we find a sweetness in the subject that doth ravish us 
and if we hate 
it is in regard that we imagine the object which presents it self unto our imagination 
is full of grief 
contrary to our apprehension 
the pleasure we take in the idea of a good thing 
which we enjoy not 
and yet promise to our selves the possession in pursuing it constantly 
begets hope 
as contrariwise 
when we think it is not in our power to obtain it 
the grief we have afflicts us 
and leads us to despair 
desires in like manner are framed in us by the imagination we have of a benefit which may give us content 
and the distaste we have of things which we flie 
is 
for that we imagine they may cause our discontent and vexation 
so as in all other passions we still find pleasure and grief intermixt 
in regard whereof we may rightly terme them 
the springs whereby all other passions are set on motion 
2 
the authour of nature hath united pleasure and sweetness to the actions of this lifeperegr 
de affect de gaud

to the end we might with more courage endure the toyles and paines 
and that they might be as salt which seasoneth meat 
and which makes it more pleasing to our taste

joy is the strength of mind and bodyprov 
1513 
&amp 
1722
q there be delights of faith and reason 
and delights of sense 
which of these be greatest
a 
undoubtedly the intellectuall 
and those of the mind 
if we consider them in themselves 
are more delightfull then those of the senses 
the reason why the pleasures of the mind have an advantage over those of the body 
is 
for that to cause pleasure or delight in us 
there must concurre three things 
that is to say 
the object united to the power 
the power to the which it is united 
and the actuall union of the one with the other 
which presupposeth knowledge of this good 
and first of all 
the goods of of the mind 
in the enjoying whereof consists the intellectuall pleasures 
are more noble and more lovely then all the goods of the senses 
and body 
whereof we have a notable proof 
in that we see men 
yea most abandoned to vice 
deprive themselves of the sweetest plsures of the body 
to purchase glory 
which is a good of the mind 
moreover 
the power of the intellectuall nature 
in which is made the impression of these kind of pleasures is much more excellent then the senses which are corporeall 
and
the actions which she produceth 
and which are followed by these pleasures 
are more noble then those which derive from the senses 
and by consequence 
the union which is made of spirituall objects with the will and intellectuall nature 
is farre more strict 
more worthy 
and more durable 
than that which happens betwixt the senses and the objects which they pursue 
it is more strict 
for that the senses regard onely the outface of things 
and do not busie themselves but to consider the accidents which inviron them 
whereas the understanding pierceth into the nature and substance of the objects 
it is more worthy 
for that it is made without any alteration or corporeall change 
whereas the object pleasing to the senses 
cannot be united with them 
but it will cause some kind of change which is full of imperfection 
it is more durable 
for that the objects of the senses are of perishable goods which soon fail 
whereas the objects of the mind 
are of eternall felicity which continues for ever 
yet it is true 
that the objects of the senses make a more violent impression in our souls 
and that the pleasure which we receive 
toucheth us much more then that which the spirits gather from the objects which are pleasing unto it 
the which happens first 
for that the goods of the body are borne with us 
encrease with us 
and are preserved with us 
so as handling them daily and hourely 
we have a more exact knowledge 
then of the goods of the understanding 
which are removed from us 
knowledge is necessary for the enjoying of pleasures 
wherefore 
where this knowledge hath least power 
there the pleasures are least sensible 
this also happens 
for that we use pleasures as remedies and cures against the crosses 
troubles and cares of this life 
which are sweetned 
and as it were charmed by their presence 
but most men being either indisposed 
or not capable to raise themselves up to spiritual consolations 
seek and tie themselves to pleasing objects 
which present themselves easily to their senses 
the which is fortified 
for that the sweetness of objects which delightour senses 
are suddainly tasted 
and do not much trouble us to seek them 
it is an infallable maxime in philosophy 
that the objects by their presence make a more powerfull impression in our souls 
then when they are absent 
and these things which give us least paine 
are most sweet in their acquisition 
so as for all these considerations 
the pleasures of the body seem unto us greater then those of the mind 
in a word 
those of the senses are more sensible 
but these of the mind 
more perfect and more excellent

to this purpose the holy ghost hath commended unto us christian sobriety and temperance as a principall vertue 
yea as a nurse and a staff of godliness and righteousness 
which consisteth in a sparing 
a moderate affection at least 
not of meat and drink only 
but of all bodily benefits 
all the wise men in the world exhort us to set a carefull guard over the pleasures of the senses 
which they call the poyson of the mind 
for the which we must the more carefully provide 
for that these passions are accompanied with a certain sweetness which flatters us at her first approach 
and surprizeth our judgment 
and charmes it in such sort 
that it helps to deceive it self
an ancient said well 
that nature had engrafted no such pernicious desires 
as those of the pleasures of the body 
for that these desires besot the mind 
and growing unbridled 
do so inflame the courages where they get possession 
as they leave nothing undone to content their passion

as one saith west of prosperity 
that it so transporteth some 
that they are even as drunke with it 
and some sorts of mirth and musick are said to make men little better 
yea 
excessive delight in these things engender many perilous diseases in the soul 
as folly 
ficklenels 
inconstancy 
niceness 
fond admiration of what cannot profit 
neglect of gods favour 
an eternall blessedness 
3 
in matters of spirituall delight 
we are specially to rejoyce in the favour of god 
and in all other things as they have reference unto him 
wherein the greatest exceedings 
if it were possible to exceed 
are most praise-worthy 
enlarge thy heart as much as is possible 
herein take thy fill of pleasure 
the more thou doest rejoyce in god 
the better it is 
and here it must be remembred 
that the delights of the senses charging 
and as it were importuning our naturall dispositions 
become tedious and troublesome 
as it falls out when we suffer our selves to be surprized with the excess of eating and drinking 
whereas those of the mind never exceed the carriage nor capacity of the naturall disposition of the soul 
but rather adde perfection to her nature 
wherefore when they are fully enjoyed 
they delight most 
and if there beat any time a distast 
it is for that the action of the mind is accompanied with the action of the inferiour powers 
the which being corporeall 
they are tired with the continuance of so long an imployment 
wherefore they call back the spirit that it may give some rest unto the body 
and doubtless 
the reason why those happy souls are never weary to behold the presence of god 
is 
for that the contemplation of this pleasing object doth not overcharge nor weaken the spirits 
but doth ease and fortifie them
q 
how is the affection of joy moved or stirred up
a 
1 
all those motives which stirre up love and affection 
consequently move desire and delight 
for love is like the quality of levity or lightness in fire 
which inclineth and bendeth it to motion 
desire is the motion 
village or voyage 
delight the quietness or rest of the soul in her object 
and therefore all those causes of love we have delivered in the matter of love 
all those may serve for this subject 
2 
a firme hope and assurance of those things we desire and love 
causeth delight 
hope nourisheth the countrymen 
for the hope of gaine causeth the labouring husbandman not to feel the scorching heat of summer 
nor the hoary frosts of winter 
hope of glory allotteth the souldier to receive a certain sweetness in all dangerous encounters 
hope of lucre maketh the merchant merry at midnight 
although he lie in the midst of the vast ocean sea tossed with billowes 
and shaken with tempests 
and the surer the hope is 
the greater joy ensueth 
as when the merchant after his long voyage returneth with his ship laden with merchandize and cometh with a pleasant gale within the sight of his expected haven 
then his hope for the certainty of his future possession of apported wealth 
being delivered from all danger 
is changed into joy and present delight 
he therefore that will move delight in this matter of hope 
must exactly declare the certain grounds and undoubted security of obtaining the thing expected 
3 
because delight consisteth in the possession of some good thing reall or apparant 
therefore all those reasons which tend to the amplification or evident demonstration of the goodness of the thing 
all those are fewel of delight 
and
sparks of joy 
it is admirable 
how the mincing and particularizing of the object of delight increaseth and augmenteth delight 
wherefore the fantasticall and lascivious poets 
though vainly and vitiously 
yet wittily and artificially depaint their lovers bodies from the head to the heels 
in every part discovering one or other perfection 
excellency 
or amiableness 
apt to move and stirre up delight 
and herein also all tradesmen excel 
for to perswade their wares to be good and perfect 
they will open unto you a number of circumstances or appurtenances of goodness or excellency wherewith their merchandize is affected 
and for this cause all that would stirre up themselves to vertue and godliness of life 
should particularize the pleasures and delights incident thereunto 
as the quietness of conscience 
the gratefulness of god 
the honour and reputation of all good men 
the reward in the world to come 
and every one of these the finer it is sifted 
the more pleasant it will appear 
5 it importeth much in moving delight to perswade the stability and continuance hereof 
that it seem not like a may-flower 
which is budded 
blossomed 
and blasted in a small time 
and the reason is 
for momenteain and cursory delights are for their brevity rather dispiseable then commendable 
the continuance of delight may be grounded upon the removing of all impediments which any way may impeach or diminish it 
6 
in every object of delight there is a certain intensive goodness and perfection 
and there is an extensive 
as in a cellar of wine 
there may be excellent good wine 
and variety of excellent good wine 
and thereby our taste may be delighted with the perfection of wine 
and with variety of wine 
in like manner 
in all the objects of delight 
we may find a certain intention of goodness 
and a certain extention 
and both these seriously considered 
exceedingly increase pleasure and delight 
for the intention filleth and satiateth the soul 
and the extension or variety taketh away a certain distastefull loathsomness which one kind of uniforme pleasure draweth with it
q 
what is the effect of pleasure or delight
a 
there is nothing in this life more potent then pleasure to move men to action 
true it is 
that ambitious men aspire after honours 
but why thirst they so after them 
but because they take an extraordinary delight to be honoured 
why do covetous curmogions the best substance of their braines to get riches 
but after they have gotten them 
to delight in the possession or fruition of them 
and the reason is 
for joy and delight are a possession of some good thing 
wherein nature receiveth great contentation 
if the heart be raised up to rejoyce in the fruition of gods favour 
and the joys of heaven 
he will spare no paines in seeking rest 
quietness 
and eternall happiness with god

why the affection of grief is to be exercised aright 
of sensible and intellectuall grief 
rules for the right ordering of grief 
and how it may be stirred up in us 
motives against immoderate sorrow 
with the meanes to redress it
question 
why is grief to be ordered aright
a 
1 
there is not any passion wherewith man is more afflicted in this life 
then with grief and sorrow 
whose objects present themselves continually to his mind and sense 
2 
excessive heaviness hath troublesome effects 
for that first of all 
it takes from the mind all meanes to attend the search of the truth 
the reason is 
for that all the powers of our soul 
being tied unto 
their essence 
as the branches unto the tree 
it doth of necessity follow 
that when she is wholly busied in the functions of one of her powers 
she abandons the rest 
and cannot assist them in their actions 
wherefore 
when as any thing draweth the soul wholly unto it 
and imploys her whole action 
she cannot attend any thing else 
by consequence whereof 
an exceeding heaviness seazing upon her 
it draws her away 
so 
as she cannot think of any thing else 
feeling her self opprest with grief as with an heavy burden 
which beares her down and hinders the liberty of her functions 
it is therefore generally true 
that there is not an action of the soul whereunto heaviness is not an hinderance and let 
the which we find verified in our selves 
for we never do any thing so well being possest by cares as when we are in joy 
whereof the reason is visible 
for that the will is the cause which excites us to act 
the which hath the good for object 
and makes the more powerfull effect when it appeares pleasing and is accompanied with delight 
it is true 
that when there remains any hope to surmount the causes of our displeasure 
then heaviness may serve to fortifie our action 
and to enflame our courage 
for that the more we feel any grief 
the more we strive to be freed from it 
but if there be no hope remaining we become as it were senseless 
and abandon our selves in prey to grief 
we flee the company of men 
we hate the light 
we find 
the comforts and consolations of our friends importuneiob 161

and have no content but to feed our selves with bitterness 
again 
immoderate sorrow causeth deadness and hardness of heart 
dis-inableth in prayer 
stoppeth the ear against all words of comfort 
and weakneth the powers of the soul and strength of grace 
exposeth to temptations of impatience 
and filleth the soul with much bitterness 
besides the torments which heaviness gives unto our spirits 
she doth also produce fearfull effects upon our bodies 
for that it is a maligne 
cold 
and drie passion 
which wasteth the radicall humour 
and by little and little quenching the naturall heat of the body 
thrusts her poyson even unto the heart 
whose vigor she causeth to wither 
and consumes the forces by her bad influence 
whereof we see the signes after death 
when as they come to open those that have been smothered with melancholy 
for instead of an heart 
they find nothing but a drie skin like to leaves in autumne 
so that all things considered 
we may say 
that this passion is most pernicious 
which thus consumes our forces 
causeth our heart to languish 
and makes our life short 
but extreamly miserable 
3 
there are many remedies against inordinate sorrow 
but most commonly the grief is so obstinate 
as all applications are unprofitable
to cure it 
we must first take away 
or at least diminish the opinion of the evil which afflicts us 
the which is easie to do 
seeing it depends of our opinion 
for 
as dignities 
honours 
crowns and triumphs 
give us no content 
but what we take our selves when as they arrive 
for that we have seen many weep even in the midst of all this pompe 
so the paines of this life 
ignominies 
banishments 
the loss of goods and kinsfolks 
with all other miseries 
afflict us not extraordinarily 
unless we our selves make them more bitter and violent by our own weakness 
for that we have seen many laugh in the midst of all there miseries 
4 
great and many are the benefits of well-ordered sorrow 
it is the physick of the soul 
it purgeth 
melteth 
refinetheccl 
73 
and preserveth the heart in good temper 
it is the ground of spirituall comfort 
the nurse of joy 
it plougheth up the fallow of the heart 
that the word of salvation might sinke deeper and deeper 
a mourning soul is a welt-manured soyl 
that receiveth the seed of the word 
and bringeth forth fruit with advantage 
immoderate sorrow deadeth and weakneth the powers of the soul 
but sorrow kept within limits and bounds 
quickneth the heart to apprehend 
judge and make use of whatsoever doth befall
q 
there are two kinds of grief 
the one which resides in the sensuall appetite 
and the other which hath its seaete in the rationall 
how do they differ
a 
1 
sensible grief ia alwaies accompanied with a visible alteration and change of the body which is moved 
whereas the grief of the mind hath not alwaies an agitation of the body 
but most commonly contains it self within the bounds of the power where it is framed 
in regard whereof it is sometimes attributed to god and angels 
2 
the cause of sensible grief resides in the body 
which suffers some violent impression that alters it 
the cause i say doth reside in the body 
which receives some kind of outrage 
but the motion of grief is alwaies framed in the soul 
for that the body is not capable but by the presence of the soul 
but the cause of the intellectuall grief resides in the rationall part 
and in the mind 
which represents unto it self the evil which the receives from the objects which present themselves unto her thought 
3 
the apprehension and knowledge which the exteriour senses have of thingskeckerm 
physic 
lib 
3 
cap 
26 
they do only regard the present objects which make an actuall impression in them 
but the understanding not onely conceives things present 
but even those that are past 
and which may happen 
or fall under the imagination of man 
hence it comes that corporeall grief which followeth the apprehension 
which things present make in the senses 
grows only from the presence of objects contrary to their inclinations 
whereas the grief of the mind following the knowledge of the understanding 
may grow from objects that are present 
past 
or to come 
and from those which man doth presuppose may succeed unto him
q 
but whether of these griefs is greater 
this of mind 
or that of the body
a 
we shew our selves more sensible of the grief of the senses 
then that of the mind 
but it is most certain that the interiour griefs which afflict the soul 
are much stronger then the exteriour paines which torture the body 
for that the apprehension of the mind and imagination 
is much more noble then that of the senses 
and especially 
then that of feeling which hath the greatest share in corporeall paines 
for proof whereof 
we see great courages to avoid inferiour grief 
expose themselves voluntarily to the exteriour paines of torments and punishments 
which are in some sort pleasing unto them 
for that the interiour joy doth mollifie their paine 
whereof we have glorious examples in the constancy of the martyrs 
who have exposed themselves to the fire 
to tortures 
to wheeles 
and to
the rage of wild beasts 
for that they would not sinne against god 
and burn incense unto idols
q 
what rules are to be observed touching the right ordering of grief
a 
1 
that which in it self is good and holy 
cannot be a just object of grief 
no man can justly be grieved to see the wicked change their life unto a better 
to embrace piety 
to become just 
valiant 
moderate 
wise 
and adorned with other vertues 
yea 
the most innocent souls rejoyce whensoever they see a man 
who was formerly vitious and disordered 
become vertuous and temperate 
there being no man living that is unworthy of vertue 
seeing that vertue by her presence doth extinguish vice 
2 
in worldly things 
such as concern our estate 
name 
credit 
friends and the like 
we must look 
that our sorrow be not distrustfull 
distracting 
excessive 
causing deadness 
violent carrying reason captive 
breeding impatience 
blind and senseless looking onely to the cross 
not to the proper cause of all miseries 
which is sinne and wickedness 
3 
spirituall sorrow for sinne 
hardness of heart 
and other maladies of the soul 
must be moved and moderated by faith 
that it might quicken to prayer 
stirre up to receive the promises of comfort 
and fit the heart to rejoyce in season 
the affections do all move in a circle 
each one drawing other 
that if any one move aright 
all follow in their course 
thus joy and sorrow succeed one another 
and both take their fit season 
if eiher be orderly in motion 
sorrow is immoderate if it admit not joy 
joy is excessive if it drownsorrow 
4 
sorrow must be universall and uniforme proportioned to evil that doth afflict 
as it is a fault to grieve when we should rejoyce 
and to rejoyce when we should grieve 
so its not to grieve for all evil 
in a measure answerable to that which doth afflict 
there be degrees of evils 
so are there of sorrow for them
q 
how may this sorrow be stirred up in us
a 
1 
desire doth cause grief 
when the possessing of the desired good is hindered or delayed 
and therefore what motives soever do stirre up desire 
the same may be used to awaken sorrow 
2 
love of good 
causeth grief for evil 
as love to our preservation 
doth oftentimes cause sorrow and heaviness 
for that we apprehend as meanes of our destruction 
by what meanes love to good is kindledpsal 
554 
5 
by the same is the heart wrought to sorrow for the contrary evil apprehended as present 
3 
the apprehension of evil 
is the object or ground of sorrow 
which is more or less intense according to the knowledge we have of the evil that presents it self unto our thoughts 
the great danger 
and eminency of it 
the arguments that set forth unto us the certainty 
likelihood 
and extension of the evill 
will be effectuall to work unfeigned sorrow

thou shalt rejoyce before the lord thy god

what course must be taken to redress immoderate sorrow

the principall meanes is serious meditation of gods gracious promises 
with full purpose and resolution of heart to rest and cleave unto them 
my soul melteth for heaviness 
quicken me according to thy word 
psal 
119 28 
the word of god doth sustain and quicken the heart 
promise grace and remission of sinnes 
reveale unto us the mercy and loving kindness of the lord 
by which light and brightness the mists of sorrow are dispelled 
and whereas excessive grief doth arise from a false apprehension of evils present 
which maketh us judge our case to be farre more intolerable then indeed it is 
by the word of truth we come to see our estate 
what evils hang over our heads 
of what quality 
how they may be prevented 
or where we may find strength to bear them 
and how all things shall work for the best unto us 
2 
grief of mind is eased by faithfull prayer 
wherein we lay open our cares into the bosome of the lord 
and waite upon him till deliverance come from above 
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord 
psal 
772

both these 
prayer and expectation must be joyned 
as we must strive to pray 
so we must stirre up our selves with all earnest resolution to waite with patience 
otherwise the weight of sorrow will fall back upon us more heavily 
3 
former experience is very effectuall to asswage bitterness of heart 
psal 
1435 
i remember the daies of old 
i meditate on all thy works 
i muse on the works of thy hands 
why hath the lord dealt tenderly with us above all he promised 
and made good whatsoever he hath spoken 
why hath he holpen us in our distresses 
kept from us the things that we feared 
granted our hearts desire 
but that we should learn to trust in his mercy 
and to expect like aid and assistance from him 
and say we be plunged into the depth of sorrow 
former experience giveth wisdom what course is to be taken to procure freedom 
in bodily paines 
if we have found ease by a medicine 
when the same evil pincheth 
we know what is to be done 
but in spirituall affairs it is much easier to get understanding by former experiments 
4 we must foresee the accidents of this life 
not as if they should happen infallibly 
for that were to make us miserable before the time 
but as incident to all men 
and that being of this number 
if any cross or misery shall fall upon us 
we may be the less amazed 
for the crosses which we have foreseen 
strike us more gently 
and make a weaker impression in our soul 
wherefore a wise man of the world 
who had prepared himself for all the accidents of this life 
receiving the heavy news of the death of his sonne 
was no otherwise moved 
but onely said 
i knew i had begotten a mortall creature 
doubtless it is the effect of an exact and singular wisdom 
to have this feeling of humane accidents 
not to be amazed at that which happens 
nor to see any thing befall him 
which he hath not foreseen 
so as a wise man must alwaies remember 
that dangers 
losses 
banishment 
infirmities 
yea the
death of his children 
wife 
and that which he holds most dear 
are things which may happen daily 
and which threaten all men 
and therefore if he be exempt 
it is the benefit and gift of god 
and if they befall him 
that they are the miseries of his nature 
for having this consideration of the common miseries of men 
he finds himself bound to suffer constantly 
and with patience 
the necessities and crosses of this life 
lest he should seem to fight against god 
who hath laid this yoke upon him 
to punish his offences 
or to keep him in awe 
5 
to mollifie our sorrows 
we must remember that the miseries of this life give us a glorious subject to exercise our vertue 
and to shew our constancy before the eyes of heaven and earth 
which are witnesses of our combates 
for as pilots cannot shew their art and industry but in stormes 
nor souldiers give proofs of their valour 
but in the midst of dangers 
so a vertuous man hath no meanes to make his vertues shine 
but amidst the adversities which befall him in this life 
6 
but that which should most fortifie us in this thought 
is 
that god who doth cast us into the middest of these combates 
will comfort and assist us in them 
crown our constancy 
and not suffer our labour to go unrewarded 
7 
grief is dispensed by divertisements 
by affairs 
by the entertainment of wise men 
by the discourse of such as are learned and fear god 
and by the force of our own judgment 
conceiving with our selves that we should not suffer any misery to triumph over our courage and constancy 
that to be toucht with affliction is a thing common to all men 
but the glory of this constant opposition 
belongs onely to an eminent vertue 
and lastly 
that he who sends us these afflictions 
is a father 
and no executioner 
that it is that great god 
without whose decree there falles not a haire from our heads 
and whose will no man may contradict 
unless he will shew himself desperately mad 
8 
as in other infirmities of the soul 
a greater evil makes the less to be forgotten 
so we may disperse a present heaviness 
either by considering that it is not the present misery which we must lament 
but others of greater moment 
which more threaten us 
or else in fortifiing our resolutions with a better hope 
as in representing unto our selves the glory of paradise 
after the miseries of this life 
and the crowns of heaven 
after the combates of the the earth 
all these things make great impressions in religious souls 
capable of the feeling of piety 
9 
besides all these 
there are remedies which are taken from the objects of the senses 
which recreate the mind and body in the midst of grief 
for first 
whatsoever delights and gives joy unto the senses

for that wine being moist and hot 
it doth at one instant both water sweetly

which is as it were the center and root whereunto melancholly doth fix it self 
sleep also and the use of bathes

it is not in the power of a melancholly man altogether to free himself from fear and sadness 
but he may choose whether he will give way too farre unto it 
he may in some sort correct himself 
a philosopher was bitten with a mad dog

we forget our fears for the time

many have been relieved by exonerating themselves to a faithfull friend 
and this is one cause why tears disperse heaviness 
and diminish our paine 
for when we pour forth teares 
we cast out that which afflicts us 
and emptying the humour which oppresseth us 
and smothers us within 
by this meanes we free our selves from an heavy burden which lay upon our hearts 
by reason whereof our soul helping her self to cast out the enemy of our life 
diverts and frees her self from the importune thought of grief 
and imploys her imagination to this divertisment 
the which for this occasion is pleasing unto her 
another reason there is 
for that it is a contentment to man 
to do an act befitting the estate wherein he
finds himself 
so 
as if amidst the mourning of our friends 
we chance to laugh unadvisedly 
when we enter into consideration with our selves 
this lightness doth displease us

why the affection of hope is to be moderated aright 
wherein the sanctified exercise thereof consists 
the effects of hope 
the sevrall kindes of disordered hope that must be shunned 
how a lively hope is to be stirred up 
and preserved in us
question 
why is hope to be moderated aright
a 
1 
hope well ordered serves to mollifie the paines 
and to encounter all the crosses and accidents of this life 
amidst the miseries of this life 
and all publique and private calamities 
which otherwise would be intollerable 
the wise providence of god hath provided us this remedy 
to fortifie our constancy 
and to keep us from shrinking 
and falling under the burden of adversities 
and therefore a rhodian being cast into an obscure and cruell prison 
among serpents and venomous beasts 
and conjured by some of his friends 
to make an end of so many miseries by a voluntary death 
he answered wisely 
that man hopes still while he breathes 
as if he would say 
that death onely could deprive man of the hopes of life 
and better condition 
but the prophet david more christianlypsal 
273 
i had fainted in my affliction 
unless i had hoped to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living 
hope holds up the head in the midst of all stormes 
which violently beate upon 
and seem to overwhelme our ship 
2 
as the north starre is the mariners guide 
who look continually upon her light to assure their navigation 
so hope is that which inflames us to the difficult actions we undertake 
3 
as the brightness of the north starre doth fill them with joy that sayl by the sea 
but when as it shines not they are dismaied 
and fear hourely to perish by the violence of some storme 
or to see their ship split upon some rock 
so whilest we have any remainder of hope 
our souls are content 
but if it be quite vanished 
we hold our selves miserable 
and begin to neglect and forget our selves 
4 
hope fortifies our resolutions 
and makes them more prompt in their actions 
hope fills with courage to endure hardness 
to beare crosses 
to fight manfully 
strive mightily 
and persist immoveably 
the which is for two reasons 
the first 
for that she hath for object 
a good hard to be obtained 
but the apprhension of the difficulty 
which presents it self in the pursuite of the good 
whereunto we do aspire 
doth usually make us gather our forces together 
to vanquish all obstacles 
and to attain unto it 
notwithstanding all the difficulties that must be encountered 
and therefore we imploy more care and diligence 
by meanes whereof we attain more easie to the end of our designes 
secondly 
hope breeds pleasure and sweetness 
which makes us more active and ready to pursue that which we desire 
for that we behold nothing painefull wherein we take delight 
wherefore as pleasure makes all actions delightfull unto men 
so the content we receive from our hopes makes us pursue with more heat 
and less paine 
that which we have once conceived in our thoughts 
this joy which proceeds from a certain hope
we have of injoying 
disperseth it self into all the members of man 
the which do joyfully receive the impressions of the moving faculty 
yeelding upon this occasion a more prompt obedience to execute the commandements of the soul 
the labourer would not expose himself so freely to the rigor of the ayr 
nor endure with such patience the injuries of times 
in tilling his land 
if he did not promise unto himself a rich harvest for the fruit of his labour 
the souldier would not cast himself into dangers 
he would not mount up to breaches 
nor thrust himself into the fury of combates 
if the expectance of glory 
or hope of booty did not animate his courage 
the merchant would not pass through rocks 
fires 
waves 
and stormes 
running from sea to sea 
and from port to port 
if he did not promise unto himself great wealth 
in recompence of his voyages and travels 
so as hope is as it were 
the soul of goodliest actions 
making us to surmount all the difficulties and obstacles 
which might hinder the execution by the mollifying of our resolutions 
yea 
it is certain 
that courage hath alwaies been held an effect of good hope 
for when as man hopes to surmount those fearfull things 
which seem to threaten him 
he goes couragiously to encounter them 
whereas when he is surprized by fear 
he faints and abandons himself unto the misfortune 
his despair rising from the difficulties which he apprehends in the good which he should pursue 
5 
although love be the fountain of all the passions of the soul 
yet hope may be the cause that we love any one 
for hope may propound unto it self two things 
that is to say 
the good which we hope for 
and the meanes to obtain it 
wherefore an object of good presenting it self unto us 
which we are not able to attain unto 
but by the assistance of other 
for this reason 
hope doth also regard those that assist us 
and make the thing easie 
seeing then that hope regards the objects which we propound unto our selves 
undoubtedly love is that root and cause of hope 
for that we hope not for any thing 
but that wherewith we are in love 
and whereunto we have tied our affections 
desiring passionately to enjoy it 
but for that hope regds him which doth open to us the meanes 
and makes the thing possible 
love is a bud of hope 
seeing that we love him 
for that we hope to attain unto our desires by his assistance 
so as the first impression which the object which we pursue makes in our souls 
is an effect of the love we bear it 
conceiving it to be a good fit for us 
but the consideration of the meanes to attain unto it 
which comes from others 
makes a second impression in us 
and induceth us to love him that doth procure it 
representing him unto us as profitable unto our design 
and therefore worthy to be beloved 
6 
vaine hopes do grievously delude and beguile the heart 
leaving nothing behinde them but vexation or despair 
after great labour and toyl 
when we be utterly disappointed 
it is not unfitly defined 
to be a dream 
that presents it self to a man awake 
for as dreames in the night fill us with illusions and vain formes 
which abuse us 
and which make us imagine that we are rich in our extremest poverty 
that we are happy in our greatest misery 
that we injoy scepters and crowns 
in the midst of bonds and irons 
that we command great empires 
when we are restrained in an hard and slavish captivity 
in like manner 
hope abusing our imagination 
fils our souls with vain contentments 
and represents unto us that all things are subject to our power 
that we are in right good estate 
assured of salvation 
able to repent when we please 
and to shunne the practice of evil by our own power 
when in truth 
our state is most miserable 
our course abhomination 
our waies tend to death 
and we have no power in our hands to deliver our selves from the reign of sinne 
or the power of wrath to come 
yea 
in the middest of our greatest disgraces 
we flatter our selves with this conceit 
that humane calamities and miseries have their bounds 
and that they are weary to be alwaies about one man 
as the winds and stormes in the end break 
and are pacified after the
most violent gusts 
thus we hope to see a change in the course of this life 
and that the day which we attend will make our condition better 
and convert our misfortunes into incomparable felicities 
when beside fond conceit we have no reason to expect better times 
the scripture resembles the hope of the hypocrite to the spiders webjob 813

lively well-ordered hope is most necessary and profitable in all the parts of our life 
and the severall actions of it 
our life without hope is a most heavy burden 
no work can find good success that is begun without hope 
hope is much better than any stately palace 
delightfull gallery

if solomon must build an exceeding magnificent temple to the lord 
david will call upon him to be strong and of good courage 
because no man of weak resolutions would ever undertake a work of that cost 
pains and weight 
for the glory of god- 4 
the conquering and subduing of many boisterous 
unruly 
deep-rooted passions

were so terrified with the height of the walles 
and strength of the inhabitants 
that casting off all hope of possessing that countrey 
they began to think of return into the land of egypt 
thus they were affected upon the first report they heard of that land 
what would they have done 
if once or twice they had fallen before their enemies 
but every christian must fight with his head-strong lusts 
that are fast riveted in his nature 
and by long continuance are become a second nature 
notwithstanding he hath been often foiled by them 
by all this it is manifest 
that a christian must be of a generous spirit and resolution 
one that cleaveth unto god with full purpose of heart

passionate courage is very inconstant 
we may observe 
that many which shew great hardiness and courage to cast themselves into danger 
as soon as they find themselves engaged 
are often amazed 
as we see in those that go valiantly to a charge 
but finding resistance 
they turn their backs to the enemy 
whereof we can give no other reason 
but that they are not valiant by judgment 
but by the bounty of nature 
so as apprehending not the greatness of the danger before they enter
but imagining that they shall vanquish whatsoever opposeth it self against them 
when as they find resistance which they did not expect 
they are amzaed at the strangeness of this accident 
and their hearts grow cold and relent in such sort 
as sometimes they flie before their enemies 
but the contrary happens to those that are truly valiant 
for when as they govern their courages by wisdome 
there is no sudden accident that may befall them 
that can dismay them 
whereas commonly they find less resistance than they expected before they entred the fight 
so as their resolution is alwayes fortfied and never deciaes 
yea 
commonly they shew themselves more cold in the beginning than at the ending 
for that it is not the passion that doth animate them 
but it is judgement which doth act in their couragesprov

good courage is a comely ornament in a christian 
there be three things that order well their going 
yea four that are comely in going 
a lyon which is strongest among beasts 
and turneth not away from any 
a horse which hath his loyns girt up 
an he-goat 
and a king against whom there is no rising in these verses solomon presents to our view for a pattern of courage 
the example of some heroicall creatures 
all agreeing in the well ordering of their going 
by whose example he incites us to a constant going forward in things well undertaken without fear 
as these four do so much prevail by their strength 
that they will not be turned or terrified from their enterprises by any terrours 
so it becomes us to be of that courage and resolution 
that we desist not from things excellent for any fear 
so that nothing is more requisite 
than that he which undertaketh a good matter should be of good courage 
and nothing more fit and decent 
than that a good cause be prosecuted with courage and resolution

inordinate courage is very pernicious

of love and a sound mind 
which constantly sharpens and whets on to despise every high thing 
that exalts it self against jesus christ 
by nature we are as timerous as the hart 
ready to fly at the very noise or cracking of trouble 
but being endued from above with the spirit of fortitude 
we lift up our heads in the times of adversity 
and put forth our selves with undaunted magnanimity to withstand encounters 
and overcome difficulties 
the least blast is sufficient to overturn us 
leaning upon our selves 
but the greatest stormes are not able to shake us 
being sustained by the divine power of the spirit 
4 
faith looketh unto god 
and gleweth the soul close unto him by supernaturall power 
whereby the heart is mightily encouraged 
for if god be on our side who can be against us 
moses was couragious

he will not leave thee nor forsake thee 
david assured himself that he should be upholden by the right hand of god 
when his soul did stick fast unto him 
though i walk in the midst of trouble 
thou wilt revive me 
thou wilt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies 
and thy right hand shall save me 
for seeing there is no wisdom 
nor counsell 
nor strength against the lord 
oh how should he be affrighted with danger or difficulty 
that is assured of gods help 
assistance 
presence and protection 
to be resolved of gods presence with us 
and providence over us 
is the best remedy of all inordinate fears 
in warre men use the sound of the drumme and trumpet to raise the courage of the souldier 
and it must be granted they be good incitements and provocations unto battell 
but when it comes to the point of danger 
to know that god stands at our right hand 
is the only thing that puts heart into us 
he that with his bodily armour brings the shield of faith 
whereby his heart is assured that god hath called him to that fight 
and that he is present with him to cover his head in the day of battell 
he is truly valorous 
though by nature weak and timerous 
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
i will fear no evil 
the lord is on my sie 
i will not fear what man can do unto me 
5 
faith informeth of the manner of gods dealing with his people 
how he corrects them in love 
as may be for their profit 
and sends deliverance 
when it may be for their good 
whereby the heart is much confirmed to bear calamities more equally 
and to seek help from the lord alone 
david prayeth in faith 
shew me thy waies 
o lord 
teach me thy paths 
6 
by faith we are assured of good success 
which doth not a little incourage and confirme the heart against all lets and impediments 
why is the righteous as bold as a lyon 
because his heart is established 
he shall not be afraid 
untill he see his desire upon his enemies 
distrust causeth sloth and dastardliness 
as it is noted of the israelites 
that they went not about to drive out the canaanites that dwelt in the valleys 
because they had
iron chariots

will proceed with valour and resolution1 sam

no recompense is to be compared to the joys of heaven

and the punishment of them that fall away

but is not grounded upon the promises of god 
this confidence may grow from the opinion we have 
that the evil which threatneth us is farre from us 
or from our belief 
that if it should present it self 
we should be able to surmount it 
as when a city hath a conceit that no man will attempt any thing against the peace of her citizens 
and if they should 
they were able to repell the injury 
and to endure the attempts of their enemies 
this belief makes them hardy and assured 
it may grow also 
for that we find our selves weak 
and unable to resist our enemies 
yet we believe that we shall be powerfully assisted by our allies 
with whose aide we hold our selves invincible 
again 
this may grow 
for that we believe 
we have neither received nor done injury to any man 
which should make us apprehend revenge 
or for that we think we have no enemies 
or else that they are so feeble and weak as they cannot annoy 
or for that they who have power to hurt us 
are our friends 
and live in good correspondency with us 
and have assisted us in our occurrents 
as for our part we have endeavoured to bind them unto us by all occasions which have been offered 
moreover 
it may grow from an imagination that all things shall succeed happily in regard of former felicities 
so alexander undertaking the conquest of india 
apprehended nothing 
by reason of the happy victories and triumphs which he had gotten over the persians 
so caesar being overtaken with a cruell storme 
and in a small barke 
feared nothing 
but to confirme the resolution of his pilot whom the storme had amazed 
he wisht him not to fear 
seeing he carried caesar and his fortunes 
and so they are hardy 
who having been ingaged in great dangers 
have yet escaped 
for they imagine that good fortune which hath been so favourable unto them in many other occasions full of despair 
will not abandon them in that present danger 
there be many other occasions of carnall valour 
as want of experience 
when we know not the greatness of the danger we are to encounter 
fury and anger 
with abundant furniture with all things which may make us fearfull to our enemies 
as store of coyne 
disposition of body 
greatness of mind 
extent of empire 
support of friends 
the power of armies 
and such like 
and to this head may be referred 
the confidence that men have in the goodness of their cause 
when they look not to the promises of god 
nor take care to reforme themselves according to the law of god

partiall 
slight 
inconstant courage is to be corrected 
when at some time 
in some things we shew courage 
but at other times

and suffer sloth and timerousness to bear sway

and wherein we have more experience 
we can shew some heart 
but are striken dead in another which appeares more difficut

hardiness is alwaies accompanied with a certain hope

whatsoever therefore is availeable to confirme hope in the gracious promises of god

namely serious meditation upon the faithfull and never-failing promises of god 
the former experiences of gods favour 
the manner of his dealing with others that cast their care upon him

and as the victory is certain 
and the reward perpetuall 
so is the fight easie to the resolute and couragious 
that relyeth not upon himself

for courage daunts the enemy 
as cowardize doth encourage him 
he hath more then half wonne the field 
that is resolved to enter into the lists 
3 
to preserve courage 
we must labour against all conceits of self-sufficiency 
endeavour the subduing of inordinate passions 
and digge out of the heart the desire of earthly things 
why do men faint 
but either they trust in themselves 
or affect inordinately the base things of this world 
or be poysoned with self-love 
either they be unsound 
or build upon a sandy foundation 
4 
we must duly consider what difficulties and dangers do beset us 
and what strength and protection we have against them 
for all the adverse powers of godliness 
the more we truly consider of them 
the less terrible they are 
and the more we weigh what encouragements we have to proceed 
the more forcible they seem 
suddain accidents most amaze 
whereas foresight and preparation diminish the apprehension of present miseries 
it is most commonly seen 
that they never faint

vain and imaginary feares do much trouble and annoy the mind 
for that we frame and forge to our selves the miseries 
the apprehension whereof afflicts our souls 
the which made an ancient to say 
that there are more things which amaze us 
then that press us 
and that most commonly 
opinion and apprehension 
doth us more harm 
then the thing it self 
wherein doubtless the condition of man is lamentable 
for that as if he were not invironed by a sufficient number of true miseries 
he forgeth others 
which are not in nature 
to increase his miseries 
for we see daily that although there appear no presages 
nor any signes of a calamity that doth threaten us 
yet our minds do frame false imaginations and vain feares 
which many times are the causes of our ruine 
there are some things which torment us more then they should do 
others trouble us before the time 
and some afflict us without cause or subject 
for that either we increase our griefs and paines 
or we forge them our selves 
or else we runne before them and anticipate them 
and whereas we should strive against these jealousies and false opinions which cause them 
we suffer our selves to be vanquished 
resembling therein certain souldiers who being amazed at a little dust raised up by a flock of sheep 
turned their backs 
as if the enemy had been at their heels 
2 
disordered fear breeds many ill effects in the mind of man 
filling it with such confusion 
as she leaves him neither memory 
nor judgment 
nor will to encounter any danger that threatens his ruine 
moreover 
it deprives man of all courage 
and whereas the apprehension of danger is a spurre to generous spirits 
to fortifie them 
and to make them seek powerfull meanes to avoid the danger 
it doth so deject faint-hearted and fearfull men 
as they remain 
as it were immoveable and uncapable of all action 
moreover 
it makes a man ashamed and confounded 
and to contemn himself 
it fils him with amazement 
and as if it were able to convert him into a rock

we must be carefull to prevent evil in the least things 
but as the things we handle are more weighty and of greater importance 
so it behoveth to be of greater fear and circumspection 
because in such cases many things happen 
which do hinder their wicked success 
4 
the fear of sinne or punishment should drive us to walk circumspectly 
to shunne and avoid all causes and occasions of them 
trusting in the free grace and mercy of the lord

we must rightly exercise faith in the serious meditation of gods power 
majesty 
goodness and mercy 
shining in his works of creation 
providence 
mercy and judgment 
we must also duly consider our own infirmity 
weakness and frailty 
the impotency of all means without gods blessing 
and the care and regard which the lord hath over us 
so long as we keep our selves close under the shadow of his wings 
that he will be our hiding place and pavillion against all them that rise up against us 
be they never so many 
mighty or malitious 
but if we forget the lord 
and sinne against him 
he will not spare to punish 
such is his hatred and wrath against transgression 
did we truly acquaint our selves with the incomprehensible majesty 
goodness 
and mercy of god 
the security of the saints when forsaken of all men 
the danger of the wicked when compassed with humane aide on every side 
the admirable over-ruling providence of god 
providig for 
and trying his servants
confounding his enemies after that he hath suffered them for a time 
we should fear aright in all things according to the word of god
q 
ought a man to look for as good success of his affairs 
when all meanes fail 
as if he had all meanes at hand 
for example 
should one that were lost in a fearfull wilderness 
where he had no food in the world to refresh his body 
as firmely believe 
and as confidently trust 
that he shall be fed at the time of his meales 
as well as if he sate at a well-furnished table
a 
the means which commonly god useth in giving his blessings 
are indeed but as curtains and drawing clothes 
after or under which god doth hide himself so 
that his working cannot be seen 
but by the eye of faith 
wherefore also the lord god 
when he hath been pleased sometimes to manifest himself 
in some work which he intended to do 
hath taken express order 
that the ordinary means should be removediud 
72 
that all the world might see the finger of god therein 
and acknowledge that he did it 
but howsoever the means in regard of him 
who is bound unto no means 
are but as curtains whereunder he hideth himself 
yet in regard of us 
who are bound unto the use of them 
when we may have them 
they are the hands of god 
whereby he is pleased ordinarily to reach unto us his blessing 
wherefore when the means fail us 
then withdraweth god his hand 
whereby he commonly useth to help us 
and we may well take it as a token of his displeasure and anger 
which must be taken to heart 
yet are we not to be troubled thereat 
so as commonly men are 
as if without those means there were no hope of help 
but we ought to grieve that we have displeased god 
and so apply our hearts to seek earnestly his favour and blessing 
which is abundantly all-sufficient without all means 
for if god compass us with his mercy 
we may be of good comfort 
even in the midst of the lyons den with daniel 
or in the fiery oven with the three young men of israel 
or in the fearfull wilderness with eliah 
or with king david in his manifold wanderings and chasings too and fro before his enemy 
when all appearance of help is taken away 
and means of escape stopped 
then must we humble our selves before god in hearty supplication 
with godly sorrow for our offences 
resting assured of his help 
if not just so as we desire 
yet so as shall be best for us both in life and death 
even as it happened to abraham when he was about to offer his son isaac 
which yet was the only known mean 
by whose life 
both he and his 
should be saved 
and for the means 
we are to know that our life and welfare is not shut up in them 
but in gods hand 
which is the richest treasure in the world 
whereout 
if he please to open it 
he bringeth the fulnes of blessing forthpsal 
14515 
behold the lord needeth but to speak the word 
and the means should readily runne to him to help us 
even our enemies which oppress us 
shall be compelled feignedly to serve us 
so soon as it shall please the lord to take our cause in hand

and shall not the king of kings 
the king of heaven 
have power to make our enemies serve us 
or do us good 
in this or that manner 
whether they will or no 
how greatly were the aegyptians enraged against the israelites 
yet god so ordered the matter 
that they sent the israelites many silver and golden vessels to enrich them with 
in the greatest need we can fall into 
let us look but unto the israelites condition in the wilderness 
which was a figure of the manifold tossing to and fro of the children of god in this wide world 
how fared they 
did not the lord make up all their wants 
by his secret blessing 
were they an hungred 
and was there no bread at hand

inordinate shame diverts many times from commendable things 
yea 
and from those which are profitable 
and which concerne the preservation of our lives 
and the welfare of our souls 
as for example 
you see at banquets 
some being prest to drink extraordinarily 
are ashamed to refuse them which invite them 
and over-ruled by their unjust intreaties 
fall into surfets which ruine their health 
others in like manner 
seeing themselves importuned or conjured in bad companies 
not to be so modest before their friends 
suffer themselves to be carried away 
to commit great disorders 
as at play 
or with women 
or to do other execrable villanies 
for the which they are grieved in their souls 
but they have not the courage to refuse such as press them 
whereby it happens often 
that flying the smoake 
they run headlong into the flame 
that is to say 
for that they are not able to resist an imaginary shame 
they fall into an eternall reproach 
there have been some also who fearing that there have been plots laid to kill them 
or to poyson them 
yet surmounted by shame 
have abandoned themselves to the danger

shame gathered from the consideration of the knowledge or presence of men 
must be subordinate to that inward confusion or shame which ariseth from the apprehension of gods majesty and glory 
our shame 
when
any reproachfull thing befalleth us 
is answerable to the worth 
authority 
and vertue of the persons before whom we suffer 
it falls out many times that we are ashamed of the disgraces we suffer in the presence of persons we respect much 
depend upon 
reverence for their gifts or love towards us 
and whose blame and censure we apprehend 
as for example 
a souldier will be much more ashamed to have fled from the enemy in the view of his captain 
then to have committed this baseness in his absence 
for the same reason our shame increaseth 
when as we receive any reproach before vertuous persons 
and such as are held to be just 
as when they are wise men 
or reverent old men that accuse us 
or be privy to our faults 
when our sinnes are discovered in the presence of such which are adorned with vertues contrary to the defects which appear in our actions 
especially if they be severe men 
who are not accustomed to pardon or excuse the errours which they see committed 
in like manner 
we blush to see our selves surprized in some notable fault 
by such as had us in good esteeme especially if they be our familiar friends 
or of our own family 
which discover the errour 
into which we had never before fallen 
or had alwaies cunningly concealed it 
thus sovereignty 
greatness 
excellency and vertue in the person before whom our nakedness is discovered 
do occasion shame 
but all these things are in god after a most eminent manner 
who is great in power 
glorious in majesty 
of most absolute sovereignty 
severe in justice 
terrible in wrath 
of purer eyes then to behold iniquity 
and of most exquisite wisdom that cannot be deceived 
in which respects we have cause to be ashamed before him 
in consideration of our manifold offences 
and the signes of his displeasure against us 
o my god 
i am ashamed 
and blush to lift up my face to thee

for our iniquities are increased over our head

our shame and confusion of heart must be proportionable to the offences that we stand guilty of before the lord 
7 
we must so take shame to our selves 
that we be driven to serious humiliation for our transgressions 
shame must be joyned with faith in the wor of promise 
which forceth hearty confession of all known sinnes

and maketh him turn aside to bewaile the aberrations of his heart and life 
when we are to speak before a person of eminent quality 
of exquisite knowledge 
or of exact judgment 
we blush and are amazed 
by reason of the great respect we have of him 
which makes us fear to faile before him 
and this fear fills us with shame 
if fear of missing breed shame 
conscience of former failings much more

of all passions of the soul 
there is not any one that takes such deep root 
or extends her branches farther than choler 
whereof neither age 
condition 
people nor nation 
are fully exempt 
there are whole countries which living under a sharp and rough climate 
are not acquainted with pleasures 
there are others 
who contenting themselves with those benefits which nature presents unto them 
are not enflamed with any ambition 
some there be 
to whom misery is familiar 
as they fear not any accidents of fortune 
but there is not any 
over whom choler doth not exercise her power 
and shew the excess of her rage 
yea she enflames whole kingdoms and empires 
whereas the other passions do only trouble and agitate private persons 
we have never seen a whole nation surprized with the love of one woman 
it was never found 
that a whole city hath been transported with a desire to heap up treasure 
ambition doth puff up but certain spirits 
but we see cities 
provinces 
and whole states 
enflamed with choler 
and transported by this fury 
with a publike conspiracie of great and small 
young and old 
men and children 
magistrates and multitude 
we see commonalties 
whom this fury hath incensed 
runne all to armes 
to revenge a disgrace 
or a wrong 
which they pretend hath been done against them 
we have also seen great and powerfull armies 
which have been the terror of the world 
ruin themselves by this fury 
which hath thrust them into mutiny against their commanders

he takes pleasure in his own affliction 
and abhorres all remedies 
flies the hand of the physician which might cure him

in this transport he is offended at any thing 
and imitates the savage beasts 
whom the most chearfull colours thrust into fury 
an innocent smile 
a shaking of the head which signifies nothing 
a glance of the eye without design 
is capable to draw him to the field 
how often have we seen this inhumane fury to dissolve even the most sacred friendship upon very frivolous subjects 
hath she not provoked dearest friends to duels 
and made them serve as spectacles of infamy both to heaven and earth 
for quarrels embraced without any ground 
it is then very apparent 
that this passion is not only infamous 
but also most wretched 
seeing that under a weak pretext of revenge 
she doth precipitate men into most horrible villanies 
and makes them tread all divine and humane laws under feet 
to satiate her insolency and rage 
wherein doubtless she is more to be blamed than all the other passions wherewith the soul of man is afflicted 
for that the other passions have this property 
that even at the very instant whenas they are as it were in the height of their transport 
give way somewhat to reason 
and
yeeld in some sort unto her commandements 
whenas she presents her self to pacifie them 
whereas choler doth like unto mariners which are amazed or corrupted 
and will give no ear to the voice of the pilot 
or as mutinous souldiers 
which will not hear the advice of their leaders 
yea 
she despites truth 
if she oppose against her rage 
and although she come to know the innocency of the party whom she presecutes 
yet she holds obstinacy more honourable than repentance

if the saying of physicians be true 
that of all the infirmities wherewith we are afflicted 
there are none worse nor more dangerous than those which disfigure the face of man 
and which make it deformed and unlike unto himself 
we must conclude by the same reason 
that of all the passions of man 
there is not any one more pernicious 
nor more dreadfull than choler 
which alters the gracefull countenance and the whole constitution of man 
for as furious and mad men shew the excess of their rage

his tongue falters 
his feet and hands are in perpetuall motion

that anger resteth in the bosom of fools

the mind of a fool is ever moved 
but the spirit of a wise man is quiet both in prosperity and adversity

is there any holy

as it agrees or disagrees from the law of god 
1 
in many places of scripture it is attributed to god himself 
to whose most perfect and just nature nothing agreeth 
but that which is just and holy 
true it is 
that neither this nor any other affection is in god if we speak properly 
but only attributed unto him 
that our weak capacities may better conceive how he exerciseth his works and eternal counsels towards his creatures 
but yet forasmuch as nothing is attributed and ascribed unto him which is not good and just 
so far forth as it is ascribed 
it evidently sheweth 
that anger in its own nature is not evil 
2 
it was created by god 
and was in man before the fall 
and before any evil entred into the worldzanch 
in eph 
426 
being therefore the lords own workmanship 
which by his own testimony was approved to be very good 
and of greater antiquity than evil it self 
it followeth 
that the affection in its own nature is to be esteemed as
good and lawfull 
3 
this affection was truly and naturally in our saviour christ himself as he was man 
for it is said of himmar 35

that he looked angerly upon the scribes and pharisees

he driveth the buyers and sellers out of the temple 
seeing then christ was angry and yet free from sinne 
it followeth that anger in its own nature is just and holy

in true repentance there must be indignrtion and revenge 
therefore all anger is not to be condemned 
6 
the scripture seems to condemn some kinde of anger 
anger is better than laughter 
be angry but sinne not 
our saviour expounding the sixth commandement 
saith 
whosoever is angry with his brother unadvisedly 
intimating that all anger is not simply unlawfull 
but that which is contrary to the law of charity 
7 
there be just occasions of anger 
for which we ought to be offended 
and if we be not angry at them 
we do fail greatly in our duty we owe to god and man
q 
anger is in many places of scripture condemned and forbiddenlev 
1918
a 
in all places where this affection is forbidden 
not the affection it self 
as it was created or is renewed by gods spirit 
but as it is corrupted and depraved with original sinne 
is to be understood 
for anger being sanctified 
is not only just and lawfull 
but also commendable 
profitable and very necessary 
as being the whetstone of true fortitude 
whereby we are stirred up and encouraged to maintain the glory of god 
and our own persons and estates 
against the impiety and injustice of men 
though anger therefore be but a bad mistress to command 
yet it is a good servant to obey 
though it be an ill captain 
to lead our forces into the field against our spiritual and temporal enemies 
yet it is a good souldier so long as it subjecteth it self to the government and discipline of sanctified reason 
in a word 
not anger simply 
but unadvised 
inordinate anger is condemned
q 
anger is a perturbation of the minde 
and therefore evil
a 
as the perturbation of the minde which is moved upon unjust causes and in unequall measure is unjust and evil 
so that which is caused upon just and necessary causes 
with due and fit moderation 
is just and commendable 
as for example 
when a man seeth god dishonoured 
religion disgraced 
wickedness unpunished 
if therefore his minde be troubled 
this perturbation is not to be condemned 
nay to be commended 
and they rather to be condemned that are not so troubledjoh

thus was our saviour troubled when he saw gods house polluted 
as also when he raised up lazarus 
thus was phineas disturbed and troubled in minde 
when he saw that shameless sinne of zimrie and cozbie 
and elias when religion was contemned 
idolatry erected 
and the lords true prophets destroyed 
though therefore anger be a perturbation of the minde 
it doth not follow that it is evil 
for not the perturbation it self 
but the cause and measure thereof maketh it good if it be good 
and evil if evil
q 
anger blindeth and confoundeth reason
a 
1 
if anger be temperate and moderate 
it doth serviceably wait upon reason 
and not imperiously over-rule it 
and rather maketh a man more constant and resolute in walking the path of truth 
which he hath descried with the eye of a clear judgement 
than any wayes dazel or offend the sight whereby he should be caused to stumble in the way 
or else turn aside into by-pathes of errour 
secondlyzanch 
ubi supra 
though it should be granted that for the instant reason is somewhat disturbed with the passion 
it doth not follow that it is evil or unprofitable 
for before the affection is inflamed the reason apprehendeth and judgeth of the injury 
and so as it were kindleth the flame 
which being kindled 
doth for the instant perturb the minde 
but the perturbation being quickly
overpassed and the minde quieted 
reason is made no less fit thereby to judg of the injury 
and much more fit to revenge it 
and therefore moderate and sanctified anger 
is so far from hurting and hindring the judgment of reason 
that it rather serviceably aideth and supporteth it 
by inciting and encouraging it couragiously to execute that 
which reason hath justly decreed and resolved 
as therefore the most precious eye-salve doth presently after it is put into the eye dim and dazle the sight 
but afterwards causeth it to see much more clearly 
so this affection of moderate and holy anger 
doth at the first somewhat trouble reason 
but afterwards it maketh it much more active in executing and performing all good designs
q 
when is anger rightly ordered
a 
when it is moved 
quickned and guided by faith 
stirring up godly sorrow for sinne committed by our selves or others 
joyned with an holy and just desire of revenge 
to the saving of the person 
appeasing of gods anger 
or the promoting of the kingdom of christ 
faith is the beginning of holy anger 
teaching what is a just and weighty occasion of it 
namely 
a manifest offence against god 
moses in sundry places is said to be angry 
but the occasions of his anger were great 
as appears in the particulars 
first 
he was wroth 
because some of the israelitesexo 
1620 
exo 
3219 
numb 
1615 
against gods commandement 
had reserved manna till the next day 
again 
they tempted god in worshiping the golden calfe 
he was also wroth 
because corah 
dathan and abiram rebelled against him 
and in him against god 
the causes of just anger are divers 
1 
when we see god dishonoured and his glory defaced 
we profess our selves to be gods subjects 
now we know that no good subject can with patience endure to hear or see the glory of his sovereigne impeached 
we profess our selves to be gods servants 
and what good servant can abide to see his master disgraced 
we profess our selves gods children 
and good children are more grieved and offended when they perceive that their parents are any wayes abused or injured 
than if the injuries were offered to themselves 
if therefore we be loyal subjects 
faithfull servants 
and loving children 
we cannot chuse but be incited to a holy anger 
if we see our glorious soveraign 
our good master and gracious father 
by any means dishonourednumb 
257 
8 
phineas when he saw god dishonoured with that shameless fact of zimri and cozbie 
being provoked with an holy anger 
he revenged this dishonour with the death of both the offenders 
thus also was elias zealous for gods glory1 king 
1914 
because the children of israel had forsaken his covenant 
cast down his altars 
and slain his prophets 
the second cause of just anger 
is when injury is unjustly offered unto our selves 
for by the law of god we are bound to seek the preservation of our own good name and state 
and therefore when either of them is violated or impeached 
we may justly use the aid of this holy anger in defending our selves and repelling injury 
though the apostle paul as of more than an admirable patience 
yet being unjustly smitten by the commandement of the high priestact 
232 
he sheweth his just displeasure by a sharp reproof 
yea our saviour christ the lively picture of true patience 
when contrary to all justice he was stroken by the high priests servantioh 
1823 
he sheweth himself displeased by his reprehension 
though at that time he offered himself as it were to suffer all contumelious injuries which pride assisted with malice could imagin or imposemat 
539 
rom 
127 
but this gives no place to private revenge inward or outward 
which is 
when out of bitterness of spirit we seek the hurt of them that have wronged usluk 
183 
if we sustain wrong 
it is lawfull to implore the aid of the magistrate 
but not with a minde or desire of his hurt that hath done us wrong 
the third cause of just anger is 
when injury is offered to our brethren 
for as by the law of charity we are bound to love them as our selves 
so the same law bindeth us to be angry for those injuries which are offered unto them 
as if they were offered unto our selvesact 
724 
and thus was moses angry with the egyptian who
wronged the israelite2 sam 
1321 
thus was david angry with ammon for deflowring his sister 
and with absolom for his cruel murthering of ammon 
and thus was good nehemiah provoked to anger when he saw the people oppressedneh 
56 
as faith sheweth what is a just cause of anger 
so it directeth in the motion 
that it be conceived upon counsel and deliberation 
establish thy thoughts by counselprov 
2018 
if thoughts must be established by counsel 
then the affections 
and so our anger also 
be slow to anger 
counsel ought to be the foundation of all our actionsjam 
119 
and therefore much more of our affections 
which are the beginnings of our actions 
moreover 
just and lawfull anger must be stirred up by good and holy affections 
as namely 
by desire to maintain the honour and praise of god 
by love of justice and vertue 
by hatred and detestation of vice 
and of all that is evil 
one saith well to this purpose 
that anger must attend upon vertue 
and be stirred up by it against sinne 
as the dog attends upon the shepherd 
and waites upon his eye and hand 
when to follow him 
and when to pursue the wolfe 
but the hatred of sinne 
and love of justice 
is quickened by a lively faith 
the object of holy and just anger is sinne 
and not the person 
but onely by reason of the sinne 
thus david saith of himselfpsal 
119139 
that he was consumed with anger 
not because the men with whom he was angry 
were his enemies 
but because they kept not gods laws 
nothing more dishonoureth god then sinne 
and nothing should more offend and displease us then sinne 
whether in our selves or others 
when therefore we fall into sinne 
we are to be offended with our selves 
that so we may avert the lords anger from us 
for as they which judge themselves 
shall not be judged of the lord1 cor 
1131 
so they who are angry with themselves for sinne 
shall escape the lords anger 
and this our anger must proceed to an holy revenge 
those that have wallowed themselves in voluptuous pleasures 
are to judge 
subdue 
and mortifie them 
though they be as dear and pretious unto them as their right hand or eye 
those who have defrauded their neighbour by purloyning away his goods 
are with zacheus to make restitution four-foldluk 
198 
and as we are bound by the law of charity to love our neighbours as our selves 
so also to be angry with them as with our selves 
namely 
with this holy kind of anger for sinne 
whensover therefore we see them by their sinnes dishonour god 
we are to be displeased therewith 
and so farre forth as the limits of our callings extend to shew our selves offended 
according to the example of the prophet jeremie 
who because the people would not hear the word of the lordier 
610 
11 
was even filled with divine wrath 
but here we must further learn to put a differene between the cause and offence of god 
and the cause and offence of man 
for just anger is directed against persons 
more for the offence of god 
then for wrong done unto our selves 
and from this it followeth 
that in our own case we must be meek and patient 
but zealous in that concernes the glory of god 
wherefore we must look to the causes of anger 
not onely that they be just 
but also weighty and of some importance 
for if every small trifle be sufficient to provoke us to anger 
well may we manifest great justice 
but without question we shall shew little love 
for love suffereth long 
it is not easily provoked to anger1 cor 
134 
5 
7 
1 pet 
48 
it suffereth all things 
the properties of holy indignation are these 
1 
it must begin at home 
we must first be angry at our selves for our own transgressions 
2 
it must be mixed and tempered with love and charity 
it is the property of god himself 
in wrath to remember mercyhab 
31 
2 
exo 
32 
and herein we must be like unto him 
this was moses his practice 
who out of his love prayed for those 
with whom he was greatly offended 
3 
anger against any offence 
must be mixed with sorrow for the same offencemat 
35 
thus christ was angry with the jews 
but withall he sorrowed for the hardness of their hearts 
the reason hereof is this 
in any society whatsoever it be 
if one member sinneth 
the sinne of that one member 
is the punishment of the rest that be in that society
even as it is in the body 
if one part be afflicted and ill at ease 
the rest will be distempered 
paul saith of himself 
that he was afraid 
lest when he came to the corinths2 cor 
1221 
gal 
61 
god would humble him for their sinnes 
but he teacheth withall 
that those which are fallen into any fault 
must be restored with the spirit of meekness 
because we our selves are subject to the same tentations 
4 
in holy anger we must observe christian modesty 
in abstaining from malicious and wicked speeches 
or unjust and spitefull actions in expressing our anger 
and to this purpose we are alwaies to remember of what spirit we are 
for undoubtedly 
how just soever our cause be 
if we defend it with spitefull and bitter speeches 
it is not the spirit of god which speaketh in us 
let us rather follow the example of our saviour christ 
who when he was buffeted 
and grossely abused 
reproved the offender with great mildness 
and of mychael the arch-angelliud 
9 
who when he strove with the divell himself about the body of moses 
durst not blame him with cursed speaking 
but said 
the lord rebuke thee 
5 
it is required also 
that in our anger there be observed a fit decorum 
and due respect 
and that both in regard of the party himself 
who is provoked to anger 
and also the other 
with whom he is angry 
for first 
in respect of the party himself 
he is not to behave himself alike in what place and calling soever he be 
for if he be a magistrate 
he is to shew his anger not only in countenance and word 
but also in actions 
if he be a father 
he is not with ely to shew his displeasure to his rebellious sonnes onely by mild admonition 
but also by discreet correction 
on the other side 
it is sufficient for him who is a private man 
if he manifest his anger in word and countenance 
nay 
it is unlawfull for him to proceed any further 
unless his calling warrant him thereunto 
again 
the offenders are not to be used all alike 
a mean private man is not to shew his anger in the same manner to a noble-man or magistrate 
as he would to his equall or inferiour 
for though he may justly be angry with his sinne 
yet he is to reverence his place and calling 
the son must not shew his anger towards his father 
as the father sheweth his towards his son 
for he is bound to fear and reverence his person 
though he justly hate his sinne 
and both these points have the saints from time to time duely observed 
moses a magistrate 
to whom the sword of justice was committed 
when he was provoked to anger by the sinne of the people 
did not onely shew his anger in countenance 
or by a mild admonition 
but by unsheathing the sword of justiceexo 
3227 
mat 
37 
and justly punishing the offenders for their execrable idolatry 
john baptist having onely authority to use the sword of the spirit 
being offended with the hypocrisie of the scribes and pharisees 
expresseth his anger by sharp and vehement reprehensionsgen 
3136 
jacob being a private man 
sheweth his anger towards churlish laban his father-in-law 
by mild and gentle admonitions 
jonathan being justly incensed by the barbarous tyranny of his merciless father1 sam 
2034 
signified his anger onely by rising from the table and departing 
the three companions of daniel though with a godly zeal they abhorred the kings prophane idolatrydan 
316 
yet they shewed their displeasure in humble and respective words 
and so though paul detested the gentilisme of festus and agrippaact 25 
yet he used them with all due respect as it beseemed their high calling 
by all which examples it is manifest that we are to use christian seemliness and discretion if we would have our anger approved as just and holy 
6 
just anger must be contained within the bounds of our particular calling 
that is so chained 
as it make us not to forgo or forsake our duties which we owe to god and man 
anger must whet on to the performance of any good office we owe unto men 
and not withdraw us in any thing 
wherein we are bound unto them 
7 
anger must be uniforme and moderate 
rising and falling according to the nature of the offence 
but ever running in his own channell 
within its banks 
otherwise it will quickly
mingle with corrupt and carnall anger 
and so degenerate into fleshly anger 
and from that to fury 
godly anger will not lean to sinne in one man 
and detest it in another 
nor fly out against this offence 
approve of that 
but it abhorreth all evil in whomsoever 
himself and others 
friend and foe 
near of blood 
and further off 
according to the nature of it 
without by-respects 
8 
it must be seasonable 
both for time and continuance 
when just and weighty occasion is offered 
then are we to conceive displeasure 
but our anger must not continue longer then the cause requireth 
lest by reason of our corruption it degenerate into malice 
for 
as the most pure wine doth in time wax sour upon the dregs 
so our most holy anger if it be long retained 
is in danger of receiving some soureness of malice from the dregs of our corruption 
the safest and best course 
is quickly to be appeased 
if the party offending shew signes of true repentance 
either for his sinne towards god 
or his injury offered unto us 
for reformation is the aime of holy anger 
which is to cease when the end is obtained 
and seeing upon hearty sorrow god pardoneth and forgiveth 
we must not retain what he remitteth 
if we would have our anger just and holy 
the end must be just and holy 
and that is 
first 
the glory of god 
which is set forth by our anger 
either when being pirvate men we shew our selves his children and servants 
by manifesting our hatred and detestation of sinne in word and countenance 
and so adorne the profession which we profess 
or being magistrates do become his instruments in punishing sinnes and executing justice 
the second end is 
the good of the church and common-wealth 
which end 
though it appertain unto all which are members of those bodies 
yet doth it more properly belong unto magistrates 
who are to shew their anger in punishing sinne 
not onely that civil justice 
which is the prop of the common-wealth 
may be maintained 
but also that gods anger which hangeth over whole countries 
where sinne is countenanced or not justly punished 
may be averted 
for if sinne be punished by men in authority 
god will not punish the common-wealth for it 
whereas otherwise 
if magistrates wink at sinne 
and so neglect their duty imposed by god 
the lord will in anger take the sword of justice into his own hands 
and punish not onely the malefactors for offending 
but the magistrate for not executing his duty 
yea 
the whole common-wealth 
which is stained and polluted with their sinnes 
the third end of just anger 
is the good of the party who suffereth the injury 
for hereby the offender is restrained from committing the like 
when either private men sharpely reprove him 
or magistrates severely punish him for his offence 
whereas if neither private men do by their anger shew their dislike 
nor magistrates inflict punishments for his misdemeanour 
he is ready to redouble his injuries 
the last end is the good of the party 
who by offering the injury provoked us to anger 
for 
private men are to be angry with their neighbour 
not because they maligne him or seek his hurt 
but because they may discourage him in his sinne 
and so work his amendment 
and in like manner 
magistrates must shew their anger in punishing offenders 
not to revenge themselves on their persons 
but that they may seek their good in reforming their vices 
for 
what greater good can a man do his brother 
then to reclaim him from his sinne 
which otherwise would destroy both body and soul by remaining in it
q 
how is this just and holy anger to be stirred up in us
a 
anger is stirred up 
quickned and increased by the exaggeration of the injury done or received 
which is done by the consideration of four circumstances 
the first drawn from the person of him that hath done the wrong 
as his baseness 
wisdom 
gravity 
vertue 
and office 
if he have pretended former friendship 
have received many kindnesses at our hands 
and in lieu of reward 
recognition and gratitude repay us with injuries and ingratitude 
if he have
offered us many injuries before 
that which we never revenged 
or which endamaging us 
greatly endamaged himself 
as a fly to put forth a mans eye 
looseth her own life 
in all these respects we have just cause to be offended with our selves for sinne committed against god 
what are we in comparison of him 
more base then the dust 
less then nothing 
if a base pesant 
should buffet a prince 
it would be accounted an heinous injury 
much more abhominable is it in me 
that i should rebell against the lord of glory 
that i should sinne against him 
who have been inriched with such wisdom and understanding 
adorned with so many gifts 
beautified with precious favours 
beset with means to keep me from sinne 
ah 
that i have used my wit to wrong ends 
my power to evil 
and so have fought against the lord with his own weapons 
many injuries have i done unto his majesty 
which he hath put up with patience 
and therefore i have taken courage to offend the more 
as he hath laden me with his mercies 
i have pressed him with my sinnes 
i that cannot brook unthankfullness in another man for some scraps of kindness 
do most unthankfully tread the mercies of god underfeet 
and what have i profited by this my disobedience 
i have denied loyalty to my absolute sovereign 
and stripped my soul of grace 
robbed my conscience of comfort 
and endangered soul and body unto eternal perdition 
and plucked upon my head many temporall calamities 
the second circumstance is the injury it self 
as if we be injured in the goods of our soul or body 
substance 
name or the like 
and as the thing wherein we are wronged is greater 
of more esteeme 
of larger extent 
so is our anger conceived against it 
specially if it aimed at an evil end 
this comes to be considered in the wrong done against god 
for we have injured him in his glory 
which is most dear unto him 
impeached his sovereignty 
which is most absolute and universall 
denied homage which is most due 
and all this to satisfie the lusts of the flesh 
to inlarge the kingdom of satan 
the third is the person injured 
as if he be one of great place 
authority and vertue 
if one that was then presently doing or labouring for the offenders good and commodity 
if among divers 
who might 
and in reason should have been injured rather then he 
yet he was singled from the rest 
and if the wrong offered to one 
hath necessarily redounded to the loss of many 
in each of these particulars we have just cause to be most offended with our selves 
for by our sinnes we have done intollerable injurie to the lord of glory 
who is great and terrible in himself 
of incomprehensible majesty 
to whom we are indebted for inestimable favours 
more then ever we can pay 
who hath been ever ready to do us good 
and loadeth us daily with his blessings 
whom should we not have wronged rather then him 
but we have wronged him above all 
and in that have hurt our selves 
our friends 
the creatures 
his servants 
who have all fared the worse for our disobedience 
the fourth is the manner of injuring 
as if we be in countenance and externall appearance held as friends 
and secretly injured like enemies 
if a long time the injury was thought upon and premeditated 
if in place where we ought to be loved 
honoured or reverenced 
there we be wronged 
dishonoured 
disgraced 
if the injury be publique before a multitude 
if often repeated and done against admonition 
in words we professed our selves to be the servants of christ 
but in deeds we denied him negligently 
willingly 
before men 
against warning 
how lightly have we regarded his presence 
how many times have we sinned against knowledge or conscience 
how have we suffered our hearts to rove after vanity 
when they should have attended upon god in his holy ordinances 
if ever there were just cause of holy indignation 
each man hath reason to be most offended with himself for his trespasses against god
q 
what are the severall kinds of disordered anger that must be shunned
a 
anger is disordered when it is not moved by faith 
ariseth not from love 
keepeth not within its bounds 
and is not directed to a right end 
the kinds are many 
1 
devilish 
which rageth against vertue and godliness 
is incensed by most innocent and vertuous actions 
some there are whose malignant eyes do abhorre nothing more then the bright beames of vertue 
either because they think that the beauty of others perfection 
causeth the deformity of their vices to seem more ugly 
or that their degenerated natures are become like unto satans 
who hateth vertue because it is vertue 
an example hereof we have in cain 
whose anger was kindled against his brothergen 
45 
because he was accepted in gods sight 
as being more holy then himself 
as also in saul who was incensed against jonathan 
for his vertuous demeanour towards david 
in asa1 sam 
2030 
2 chro 
2620 
who was offended with the prophet the ambassadour of the lord 
for delivering faithfully that ambassage which the lord had put in his mouthdan 
313 
in nabuchadnezar who was enraged against the three young men 
because they refused to commit idolatry 
and in the jews 
who were filled with wrath 
because our saviour made a true exposition of the scripturesluk 
428 
and rightly applied them unto them 
and too many examples we have in these daies 
of such as cannot with any patience endure to hear their duties taught them 
and their vices publikely reproved out of gods word 
or yet any private admonition2 sam 
38 
but they are ready 
like those that are in a raging fit of a burning ague 
to despite the physician 
that endeavoureth to cure them 
yea 
the sight of godliness doth move some to rage and fury 
that they are vexed at nothing so much as to see that some make conscience of their waies 
2 
rash and unadvised 
which hath divers branches 
first 
unjust anger 
that hath no other ground but our own suspicion or imagination1 sam 
1728 
and thus was eliab angry with his brother david 
because he suspected him to be proud 
whereas in truth his own pride was the cause of his suspicion 
and this is the most common cause of anger in these daies 
for want of love causeth men to interpret the actions of others in the worst sense 
and upon their false surmises they ground their anger 
one is angry because saluting his neighbour 
he did not resalute him 
whereas perhaps he did not see him 
or at the least having his mind otherwise occupied did not observe him 
another is offended if any in his company is merry 
thinking that he maketh himself sport with his infirmities 
another because he is too sad 
imagining that it is because his company displeaseth him 
yea 
so prone are men to invent causes where none is 
that oftentimes they are sore displeased because they have received small benefits not answerable to their expectation 
or not equall to those they see bestowed upon otherseccl 
44 
or because they thrive not as fast as their neighbours 
or such as belong unto them rise not in the world as their fellows and companions 
the second branch of rash anger is causeless 
when we are provoked upon no cause 
or by every small and trifling occasion 
hereby love and charity is notably violated 
when every slight cause incenseth us to anger 
for love suffereth all things 
and therefore their love is small who will suffer nothing 
love covereth a multitude of sinnes1 cor 
137 
prov 
1012 
they therefore that find causes where they are not 
rather then cover them where they are 
do plainly shew their want of love 
and their too great proneness to anger 
it is the nature of love to make great faults seem little 
and little faults none at all 
but anger maketh every slip a capitall offence 
and every word of disgrace worthy a stab 
and as when we behold the sunne rising through thick and foggy vapours 
we imagine it to be of a farre greater quantity then when the ayr is pure and clear 
so when the foggy mists of anger do overshadow reason 
we suppose every fault to be greater then it would appear if this turbulent affection were dispelled with the lively heat of ardent love 
some are angry at the imperfections of nature 
which being not in the parties power to amend 
should rather move compassion then provoke anger 
others are angry at faults committed
at unawares 
unwillingly and unwittingly 
whereas they might with as great reason be angry with a traveller for going out of his way 
or with one who stumbleth in the dark for not keeping footing 
or with one who is sick because he is sickprov 
1911 
it is the glory of a man to pass over a transgression 
to wink at smaller infirmities 
and to remit greater wrongs 
yet not so 
as to be silent at gods dishonour 
with the perill of the soul of the sinner 
or at the grievances which are offered to himself from them 
to this head also must be referred hasty and suddain anger 
which is conceived without counsell and deliberation 
this is condemned and forbidden in the word of godeccl 
79 
be not of an hasty spirit to be angry 
for anger resteth in the bosom of fools 
this hastiness to anger is a foolish vice 
for as it alwaies beginneth with rashness 
so it commonly endeth with repentance 
for after the hasty man hath injured his neighbour by unadvised words or injurious deeds 
then he sheweth himself sorry for it 
and so like a foolish surgeon 
first he breaketh his head 
and after gives him a plaster 
which though it heal the wound 
yet oftentimes it leaves a scarre 
these are but the least evils which accompany rash anger 
for how many have there been who in their fury have revealed their friends secrets 
more dear unto them then their own lives 
yea 
how many through this rash anger have violated the persons 
nay murthered them with whom they were linked in the straightest bonds of friendship 
and so have done that in a moment 
which they have with bitterness repented the whole course of their lives 
then the which no greater folly can be committedprov 
1417 
29 
prov 2922 
prov 
1216 
and therefore it is well said of the wise man 
he that is hasty to anger committeth folly 
and lest we should think that he seldom thus offendeth 
he telleth us 
that a furious man aboundeth in transgression 
3 
immoderate and immodest anger is disordered 
for be the cause of anger just and lawfull 
yet if it degenerate into wrath and fury1 sam 
2513 
2 
if it grow violent 
it savoureth not of the spirit 
but of the flesh 
now if we would know how to discerne when our anger is immoderate 
it is easily known by the fruits thereof 
as first 
when it provoketh us to utter words dishonourable to god 
either by prophane blaspheming of his holy name 
or wicked cursing and imprecations 
whereby we desire that he should be the executioner of our malice 
or opprobrious to our neighbours 
as when our anger bursteth out into bitter and reviling speeches tending only to his disgrace2 sam 
165 
an example whereof we have in shemei 
who reviled david with great bitterness 
giving him bad and unreverent termes 
secondly 
when it bursteth forth in unseemly 
scornfull 
and contemptuous gesturesact 
754 
eph 
431 
thus the jews 
in undecent and uncharitable manner 
gnashed with their teeth at steven 
and paul sets down clamours and crying speeches between person and person 
as the fruits of wicked anger 
thirdly 
when we have no regard of any decorum or order 
either in respect of our selves 
or those with whom we are angry 
not in respect of our selves 
as when by anger we are provoked to take revenge being but private men 
whereas revenge belongeth only to god 
and to the magistrate who is the lords deputy 
according to thatrom 
1219 
deut 
3235 
avenge not your selves 
but give place to anger 
for it is written 
vengeance is mine 
and i will repay it 
saith the lord 
so also our anger is immoderate when we have no respect of the party with whom we are angry 
as when the son being provoked to anger against his father 
though it be for a just cause 
doth not use him with that respect and reverence which becometh him 
but bursteth out into undutifull and insolent speeches 
quite contrary to the example of jacobgen 
3136 
who being but a son-in-law did not in his anger forget his duty 
though in vehemency he somewhat exceed 
and of jonathan 
who though he had just cause to be angry with his father saul1 sam 
20 3 
yet he only shewed it by rising from the table and departing 
and the like may be said of the servants anger towards his master 
the subjects towards the magistrate 
and of all inferiours towards their superiours 
fourthly 
when it makes us to forget
any duty of love which we owe unto them 
for good anger hinders not from 
but furthers us to the performance of all good services in the behalf of the delinquent parties 
as to pray for them 
give them direction for reformation of their transgressions 
it was an error in the disciples 
that forgetting their duty of love unto their brethren 
they desired that fire might come down from heavenluk 
959 
and destroy the samaritans 
fifthly 
when it stirreth up to violent 
inconsiderate 
unseasonable reproofs 
anger is too hotpsal 
10632 
33 
if we cannot hold in till it be fit to speak 
if we be so overcharged 
that we cannot rest till we have uttered our mind 
without respect of the season and opportunity 
it is too violent to be good 
lastly 
anger is over-violent when it is not mixed with sorrow proportionable to the displeasure that we conceive 
for godly anger issueth from love 
and is joyned with compassion 
so that he that is moved with anger against the offence 
cannot but pity and grieve for the offender 
in degree answerable to his anger 
4 
partiall 
deformed anger is out of frame 
for 
as faith cleaveth to the whole word of god 
so the affections moved thereby are universall and uniforme 
if they carry the stamp of god 
they must necessarily be moved according to his property 
now anger is deformed 
first 
when it is hot and fiery against some sinnes 
but can brook others no less notorious 
either because it doth sute with our disposition 
or we have little wrong thereby 
for holy anger must be measurably porportioned to the measure of the offence 
greatest indignation must be conceived against the greatest transgressions 
though they bring not to us so great annoyances 
and smaller faults should less displease us 
though in private respects they seem to be more for our damage 
for every part ought rather to be tenderly affected at gods dishonour 
then his own detriment 
secondly 
when we are zealous against sinne in our enemies 
or them that we like not 
but remiss against it in our selves 
our familiars 
benefactors 
kinsfolks 
and dearest friends 
he that is moved at sinne as he ought 
doth more take to heart the sinnes of them that be nearly united to him 
then of them that be further off 
as the sinne of a brother 
more then of a stranger 
of a child more then of a brother 
of a yoke-fellow more then of a child 
and our own more then of a yoke-fellow 
child 
brother 
or of any or all others 
thirdly 
when we are moved equally with small and great offences 
for there be degrees of sinne 
and accordingly our anger must be incensed 
5 
anger is unlawfull when it is directed against the person of the offender 
not against his offence 
and aimes at his loss 
hurt or destruction 
but propounds not any lawfull end 
as the glory of god 
the publique good of church or common-wealth 
the private benefit of our selves or of our neighbours 
or the reformation of the delinquent party 
he must needs shoot wide 
that looks awry 
and this is alwaies to be observed in all examples of unjust anger 
as in cains anger towards abel 
sauls towards david 
nebuchadnezars towards the three companions of daniel 
the scribes and pharisees towards our saviour christ 
but if we will be christs disciples 
we must follow his doctrine and example 
his doctrine 
love your enemies 
do good to those that hate youmat 
544 
that you may be the sonnes of your father which is in heaven 
where he plainly intimateth 
that they are not the sonnes of god 
who do not love the persons of their very enemies 
we must follow also his example 
who prayed for his enemies even while he was upon the cross subject to their outragious injuriesluk

766 
numb 
2410
quis furor est terram sensu vexare carentem
homer reprehending achilles 
which blessed president holy stephen imitated 
but many are not only incensed against the persons of their enemies who are men like unto themselves 
but also with bruit beasts 
which are not capable thereof 
as we may see in the example of balaam 
yea 
even with things that want both sense and life 
and so was xerxes angry with the rivers 
and sent letters full of menacing threatnings to the hils 
and many such are subject to continuall view 
who if any thing in their hands displease them 
will not stick to dash it against the ground 
though after 
they
are fain to take it up again 
or to spoile and break it in pieces 
though afterward 
they must be glad to bestow great labour in repairing that which by greater folly they have defaced 
but these men may fitly be compared unto children 
who having gotten a fall 
beate the earth 
so they having received some hurt through their own folly or negligence 
are angry 
6 
unseasonable anger is unjust 
when as being long retained it becometh hatred 
and this hapneth not only when men are provoked unto anger upon weighty causes 
but also when it is grounded on the most slight occasions 
for when vain trifles have stirred them up to wrath 
they persevere in it 
lest they might seem to have begun without cause 
and so against all reason the unjustice of their anger makes them persist in it with greater obstinacy 
for therefore they retain it 
yea 
increase it 
that the greatness of their anger may make men believe that it could not choose 
but arise from some weighty occasion and just cause 
and so they choose rather to seem just 
than to be just
chap 
xii 
severall motives to stirre men up against carnall anger 
and the objections that are usually made by passionate men 
by way of excuse 
answered
question 
what motives should stirre men up to take heed of carnall anger
a 
the first may be drawn from the evil and hurtfull causes of unjust anger 
which are these 
1 
infidelity or unbelief in the word of grace 
david rendring the cause of his patience and quietnesspsal 
3813 
14 
15 
that he was deaf and dumb 
when the ungodly did molest and vex him 
he seteth down this 
that he waited upon god 
therefore it is to be attributed to infidelity 
that men are so easily provoked to revenge 
so apt to leap unto reproaches 
for the heart of man being purged by faith 
would extinguish those furies 
and fervent motions of mind 
at least would coole them mucheccl 
79 
2 
folly exalteth anger 
anger resteth in the bosom of fools 
amongst men he is accounted unwise 
who is not suddainly moved to anger for an injury offeredprov 
1429 
and doth not repell force by force 
give taunt for taunt 
but the spirit of god farre otherwise brands him for a fool that is soon provoked to anger 
or to seek revenge 
3 
self-love 
whereby we so immoderately love our selves 
that we never think of the injuries and indignities which we offer others 
or else suppose them to be none 
or else lightly esteem of them 
as not worthy the recitall 
but on the other side 
it maketh men hainously aggravate injuries offered unto themselves 
and so to make huge mountains of small mole-hils 
it causeth the heart easily to apprehend the wrong 
busie in meditating of it being apprehended 
eager in seeking revenge after meditation 
and the hand no less forward in acting those tragedies which the heart hath invented 
for by self-love men are induced to think themselves worthy of all love and honour 
and therefore if a small injury be offered unto them 
they suppose that death is too small a revenge for so great an indignity offered to such worthy personages 
yea 
if they be not so much respected as their haughty ambition requieth 
or if others be preferred before them 
and that deservedly 
that is matter enough to provoke them to furious rage 
not onely against them of whom they are not regarded 
but them also who are preferred in others judgment 
and this is evident in the example of caingen 
4 
who because god respected the offering of abel more than his 
was incensed to wrath 
and had his anger so inflamed that
nothing could quench it but the blood of his dear brother 
and in saul who could with no patience endure1 sam 
198 
that the praises of david should surmount his in the sight and audience of the people 
but was enraged with deadly anger against him 
who for his merits deserved to be advanced 
and thus doth self-love make a man wink at those injuries which he offereth others 
and to put on the spectacles of affection when he looketh on those wrongs which are offered to himself 
whereby it cometh to pass that every small injury seemeth great and provoketh to great anger 
whereas if we thought meanly of our selves and loved our neighbours as our selves 
we would not suffer our judgment to be over balanced with the weight of affection in judging of the injury 
nor give the reines to our anger in pursuing it with revenge 
4 
pride causeth men to be more sharp-sighted in descrying wrongeccl 
78 
and more furiously insolent in taking revenge 
the reason hereof is apparent 
proud men being jealous of their honour and reputation 
are also very suspicious of contempt 
so that the least injury provoketh them to choler and disdain 
because they are ready to imagin that thereby they are exposed to contemptprov 1310 
onely by pride do men make contention 
pride alone of it self without the aid of any other thing 
is sufficient to kindle contention 
a clear example of this matter we have in the tribe of ephraim 
who being lifted up and swelling in conceit of their multitude 
did contend with gideon about a thing 
for which they should have been thankfull unto him 
and which is more 
when being called to the warre they did not come 
they do yet chide with jephtejudg 
81 
that they were not called 
when by right he might have expostulated with them 
that being called they did not comejud

this was the cause of often disputations amongst the disciples 
as is manifest by the remedy prescribed for the cure of that malady 
the wicked by his pride doth persecute the poor 
this we see in haman 
who was so enraged with furyest 
35 
6 
because mordecai would not in the sight of the people do him that reverence which his proud heart desired 
that he thought his death too small a revenge for such an indignity 
unless also for his sake he utterly rooted out his whole kindred and nation 
so that the least spark of anger kindled with the smallest occasions 
bursteth out into a raging flame of fire 
if it be blowed with the wind of vain glory 
whereas on the other side 
he that is humble is not provoked to anger though he be neglected 
because his lowly conceit maketh him think that he is not worthy to be much esteemed 
nor yet though he have received an injury 
because he is ready to think that he hath deserved it

or more hanious sinnes against god

covetousness stirreth anger 
for this vice maketh men desire much riches 
and if their hopes fail them 
and be not correspondent to their desires 
their unquiet and turbulent thoughts are fit harbingers to prepare a lodging in their hearts to entertain anger 
it maketh them undertake great matters 
which when they are not able to compass 
their hearts are filled with vexations 
and they become more wayward then children 
or else if their covetous desires carried with the wings of ambition mount not so high a pitch 
they basely stoop even to the most sordidous prey

never suffering it self to be transported with the furious motions of choler 
now the thing that effeminates the mind 
are inordinate lusts 
which like corrupt humours in the body 
do impair vigour and strength 
7 nice luxuriousness or luxurious niceness breedeth choler 
for 
if you come into the house of one who is nice and curious 
you shall easily perceive how soon they are incited to great anger upon little cause 
if the decking and adorning of their house be not fully answerable to their minds 
if their costly cates be not so daintily cooked 
that they may delight their curious learned tast and cloyed appetite 
if a spot or wrinckle be upon their garments 
they are so inraged with anger 
that the house will scarce hold them 
or at least not contain their clamorous voices 
these curious folks are not only offended with injuries 
but also with shadows and appearances 
for 
when voluptuous pleasures have corrupted both mind and body 
nothing seemeth tolerable 
not that the things which they suffer are grievous 
but because they that suffer them are nicely effeminate 
and like as they who are tormented with the gout 
are angry if a man come but towards them 
and cry out if they be but touched 
so but a shew of injury moveth these voluptuous wantons to choler and anger 
and the least injury offered in truth inciteth them to rage and fury 
whereas others who have not their minds effeminated with this luxurious curiosity 
they can easily pass over such trifling imperfections 
and repell anger in far more violent assaults 
and lest any should think 
that these toys deserve not just rebuke 
let him know 
that the lesser the occasion is which provoketh to anger 
the greater is their sinne who are so easily provoked 
for 
howsoever the occasions are but small 
yet their sinne is not small 
nay 
their sinne is therefore great 
seeing the occasion which moveth them thereunto is but little 
8 
curiosity is a cause of unjust anger 
for 
when men are tickled with a vain desire and itching appetite to see and hear all things 
how their friends behave themselves in their private meetings 
what their adversaries do and say behind their backs 
how their servants bestow themselves in every corner 
it cometh to pass 
that desiring to know all things 
they know many things which displease them 
and provoke them to anger 
for which they may thank their vain curiosity

take no heed unto all words that are spoken 
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth

this argument the apostle useth

33 
for we our selves also were sometimes foolish 
disobedient 
deceived 
serving divers lusts and pleasurs 
living in malice and envy 
hatefull and hateing one another 
but it is the custome of men addicted to anger to imitate the lamiae 
who 
as the poets fain 
use their eyes abroad 
and put them into a box when they come home 
so these are but too quick-sighted abroad in spying the faults of others 
but starke blind at home in discerning their own faults 
and though they have a great beame in their own eyes 
yet they can easily discerne a small mote in the eye of another 
and the reason is 
because they put their own faults into that part of the wallet which they cast behind their backs 
and therefore never look upon them 
but the faults of others into that part which hangeth before them 
whereinto they are alwaies curiously prying

a second motive may be taken from the mischief of this passion in comparison of others 
all other passions do but draw men to evil

but this doth overthrow them

that there is scarce any other affection so strong which it doth not easily subdue 
love is said to be stronger than death 
and yet anger if it be once admitted easily overcometh it 
for there was never any love so hearty and intyre but anger hath subdued it 
the father in his anger forgetteth his love to his child 
and the child to his father 
the husband to his wife 
the wife to the husband 
and causeth them instead of duties of love to bring forth
the fruits of hatred 
yea 
it maketh a man to forget the love of himself 
as appeareth by those men who to satisfie their anger 
violently thrust themselves into eminent dangers of death 
as we cannot discern the heat of the sunne 
when we are near unto a scorching fire 
so the heavenly heat of divine love it self is not felt 
if the furious flame of anger be kindled in our hearts 
covetuousness also is a most strong and violent vice 
which nothing almost can vanquish but death 
and they who are possessed therewith 
do love their riches better then their own lives 
as we may see in their example 
who being deprived of them murther themselves 
yea 
they are more dear unto them then the salvation of their souls 
as may appear by those who fall into outragious sinnes 
whereby they plunge their souls headlong into hell

and by them also who despise the means of salvation in comparison of a small worldly trifle 
and yet anger being once admitted doth overcome covetousness 
as it is evident in the example of them 
who to satisfie their furious anger by the death of their enemy 
are content to forfeit their goods though they be never so covetous 
besides the double hazard of their lives which they incurre 
both in their private quarrell 
and in satisfying by deserved punishment publique justice 
the like also may be said of them who by anger being incited to revenge 
are content to spend all their substance by prosecuting wrangling suits in law 
of little or no importance 
to the end they may impoverish him also with whom they are offended 
and so are content to pull down the house upon their own heads 
that they may overwhelme another under the weight of the same ruine 
choler is worse then voluptuousness 
for lusts make men to plunge themselves in particular pleasures 
whereas choler makes them of so bad a disposition 
as he is delighted in another mans miseries 
it is in some respect much more wicked then envy 
for that if envy desires to see any one miserable 
it is choler which procures the misery 
fear is a cruell savage tyrant 
which oftentimes compelleth men to thrust themselves into imminent dangers 
that they may avoid dangers 
and to kill themselves for fear of greater torments 
and yet anger vanquisheth fear 
many times causing them who would tremble to see anothers wound contemn their own death 
and so turneth the most cowardly face into most desperate rage and furious resolution 
anger is kindled by a just opposition 
and by the knowledge of the little reason that a man hath to be angry 
it is sharpened by silence and cold reply as gathering thereby that it proceeds from contempt 
it will be both judge and party 
it carrieth us beyond our selves 
so that we do things dangerous and scandalous 
it is rash and inconsiderate 
and so casteth us into great mischiefs 
like old ruines that burst themselves upon that which they fall 
so that other affections lead a man 
but this draws him 
others intice him 
but this compels him 
others dazle the sight of reason 
but this makes it starke blind 
others make us prone unto evil 
but this casts us headlong even into the gulfe of wickedness

so anger having obtained soveraignty over the mind

madness is the evil of punishment

so as in truth there must be some kind of reason to provoke choler 
for that men which are stupid and dull are not capable of these motions 
but when this passion is fully enflamed 
then she doth wholly darken reason 
anger then perverteth judgment 
overthroweth counsel 
and pulleth out the eyes of reason 
making the slave of passion

fretting and discontent

is oftentimes by the froward behaviour and obstinate stiffness of the one party so offended and displeased 
that whereas he was indifferent he is made an adversary 
so the lord playeth the part of an umpire or arbitrator 
to work reconciliation between brethren 
but if either of them be so stiff and contentious that he will not be reconciled 
what doth he else but by refusing the lords arbitrement and determination make god his enemy

it bringeth many times great and suddain judgments 
for as solomon observes 
a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment 
and if thou deliver him 
yet thou must do it again 
hence it is that our saviour christ denounceth judgment both temporall and eternall against unadvised anger 
he that is angry with his brother without causemat

is in danger of judgment

a furious angry person is the prey of satan 
for this raging passion 
having put out the eye of reason 
makes him a fit instrument for his own business 
that is 
in plotting and devising that revenge wich is pleasing and acceptable unto him 
whereby it evidently appeareth 
that unadvised anger is a notable means which satan useth to work our destruction 
for 
when once by rage he hath blinded the eye of reason 
he can easily lead us into a gulfe of all wickedness 
in respect whereof 
satan is compared to a carion crow 
which
intending to make the carcass of some silly lamb his greedy prey 
doth first pick out the eyes 
that it may not be able by flight to prevent a further mischief 
so he indeavouring to make a prey of our bodies and souls 
doth first seek to blind reason 
which is the eye of the soul 
with the fury of passion 
that so not having judgment to discerne his sleights 
nor wisdom to avoid them 
he may the more easily lead us into the pit of perdition 
or he may be likened to a cunning fisher-man 
who troubleth the water that the fish may not descry his net 
so satan blindeth our reason with this turbulent affection 
that we should not discerne the sinnes which like nets he hath laid to intangle us 
before we be fallen into them 
for 
anger casting a mist of perturbation before the sight of reason 
maketh men unable to judge of good and evil 
right or wrong 
and whereas reason in its own nature judgeth that which is right 
anger maketh that seem right which it judgeth 
3 
it is recompensed with contempt 
for howsoever they are therefore angry 
because they would not be despised 
yet nothing in truth doth sooner work base esteeme and disregard in the minds 
not only of strangers 
but also of a mans own children and servants 
then unjust anger 
for it notably blazeth abroad and discovereth their shame and folly 
which occasioneth contempt 
as wisdom causeth honour and respect 
again 
when their anger and the fruits thereof 
clamorous brawling and fighting 
are usuall and common 
as well for trifles as weighty matters 
men desperately contemn both 
when they have hope to prevent neither 
they therefore who desire that these bitter drugs of correction should have any effectuall operation in the minds of inferiours 
for the purging away of their faults and vices 
must use them like physick 
which if it be ordinary will work no extraordinary effect 
if thunder and lightning were as common as the sun-shine 
though they be terrible in themselves 
yet who would regard them being so usuall 
and how much less then the impotent brawlings of an angry man

the fourth motive may be taken from that high account the lord makes of an heart well mortified and purged from the dross and superfluity of lusts and concupiscence which it is stuffed withall 
in the law the nazarites were enjoyned not so much actuall worship 
as a straight restraint of the flesh from all unlawfull excess 
which was shadowed out by their diet and decking the body

and cheerfulness 
readiness and integrity of service

2326 
my sonne give me thy heart 
he meaneth not a rotten heart and corrupt 
but an heart well searched 
and well drained from sinfull affections and lusts 
such an heart he calleth for and chuseth 
for he knows 
that where a mortified heart is 
there also is an heart quickned to the life of god 
and the more fit for duty 
both within and without 
the chief service of god is inward 
which cannot be performed 
till the evil habits and qualities of the soul be changed 
and new ut i 
for no man grafteth upon a rotten stock 
nor put new wine into old
vessels 
a christian may fetch surer evidence from hence of his reformation 
then from any particular duty to the affirmative commandements of the moral law 
and more soundly distinguish himself from an hypocrite 
i separate not the parts of repentance 
but divide the false from the sound by this rule 
for look how much a man profiteth in this piece of religion 
so much he groweth truly religious 
wherefore they that have chosen the easier course of service 
i mean 
to do good duties 
must be admonished to tend better that other part of christianity 
which hath been less regarded by them 
and that they travell in denying themselves 
overcoming their passions 
abstaining from 
and crucifying their corrupt nature 
where it is strongest in them 
and so shall their religion prosper 
and better beseem them 
for though it be the harder part of the two 
yet time bestowed therein 
will countervaile the labour most plentifully 
and for a good man to be a debtor to any lust 
is most unseemly 
but to be a server 
fulfiller

it will not be admitted for a just excuse before a temporall judge 
to say i am prone by nature to such a crime 
and cannot leave it 
nor will the judge of heaven and earth hold us excused 
if we make any such plea before him 
if we be prone to anger 
we had not this nature by creation 
for we were created according to gods image 
who is slow to anger 
but this corruption hath taken hold of us by reason of original sinne 
and therefore we are not to excuse one sinne by another 
but rather earnestly to labour that this pollution may be washed away with the water of gods spirit 
who by his grace doth reforme nature 
if we be of such a wicked disposition 
that we cannot but be angry 
our sinne is the more hainous 
our state the more dangerous

because
to shew it would be some stain to their reputation 
this hidden anger is farre worse then professed 
both in respect of the party who is angry 
and the other with whom he is angry 
in respect of the party himself 
because containing in him this turbulent affection 
it doth vex and torment him 
like a raging fire which hath no passage 
or a violent streame whose current is stopped 
in respect of him also with whom he is angry 
because it maketh him less wary in preventing his malice 
and therefore the more easily surprised

for as a small company of men lying in an ambushment

men can binde heavy burdens upon the lords shoulders 
which themselves will not take up with the least of their fingers 
and that appears by the slight account they make hereof 
and their dealing so carelesly in so weighty a matter 
for although he can change and renew their hearts into the obedience of his blessed will 
yet if this were the thing they desired 
they would first apply themselves to that grace of his 
which is able to work this effect in them 
and then put over and commend the blessing of their labour to god 
which while they neglect to do 
they have that within them which shall witness against them 
to be the wilfull causes of their own desolation 
the lord is not bound to them in the least respect 
to minister means of the word 
in afflictions 
benefits

help by others 
much less grace to be humbled and repent 
therefore in that they use none of these ordinances of his 
to the wholesome ends to which they are appointed 
the sin is theirs 
he is guiltless 
in that he hath offered them more fair 
than themselves were willing to accept of 
never did the lord leave any to himself 
hardened and impenitent 
who desired to profit under his doctrine and discipline 
therefore let men beware they overreach not

shall we stand in need of forgiveness

shall god forgive infinite sins 
and shall not we pass by one offence 
shall we stand in need of a sea of mercy 
for the washing of so many foul offences 
and shall we not let one drop fall upon our brother 
to forbear and forgive in trifling wrongs

how long bare he with judas 
being no better than a devil within his family

he was loath to discover him plainly to be the man

psal 399 
for god hath bid him raile 
i should have been dumb 
and said nothing 
because thou didst it 
this perswasion 
that all the wrongs we suffer do come from god 
is many wayes forcible to move unto patience 
first 
it constraineth us to confess 
that all our chastisements are just 
even farre less than by our sins we have deserved 
for they are but light 
or if not light 
yet momentanie 
but our sins have deserved
infinite and eternal punishments 
if therefore the lord use these earthly rods to correct our sins 
we are rather to admire his mercy than to be angry at so gentle chastisement 
secondly 
it teacheth 
that the manner of the lords dealing is exceeding tender and compassionatepsal 
2510 
all the waies of the lord are mercy and truth 
to them that fear him and keep his testimonies 
when we deserve to be cut down root and branches 
and cast into unquenchable fire 
he doth only lop and prune to make us more fruitfull 
therefore if the matter be well weighed 
we have more cause to be thankfull 
than to be offended 
is the patient discontented with the pils that are prescribed by his learned physician 
because they purge the body of that sick matter which would impair his health 
3 
it assures that god in his infinite wisdome will dispose of every thing for our goodrom 
818 
why then should we vex our selves with anger 
seeing god will turn the injuries of men into blessings 
let us rather when any wrong is offered us 
which we cannot by just and lawfull means avoid 
say with our saviour christjoh 
1811 
should i not drink of the cup which my father hath provided for me 
should i be angry with the cup 
because the physick is bitter 
or with the hand whereby it is conveyed unto me 
my heavenly father correcteth me for my good and amendment 
i will not therefore be angry with the rod wherewith i am beaten 
but rather look to the principal hand that layeth the chastisement upon me 
and the happy fruit that it brings with it 
fourthly 
it acknowledgeth the present course that god holdeth to be best 
most behovefull for us 
for god is wisest 
his prescriptions most safe and healthfull 
now therefore there is good cause why we should cease to be angry for crosses 
wrongs and injuries 
unless we will be fighters against god 
resist our own profit 
and choose rather to please the palate though to our great torment afterwards 
than to preserve health and peace 
these potent arguments of faith well setled in the heart 
cannot but quiet and pacifie the soul in the midst of manifold provocations 
fifthly 
it looketh up to christ 
and imprinteth the vertues of his death upon the soul 
look as the seal applied to the wax 
leaveth its stamp and image upon the wax 
so the death of christ being close set unto the heart by a lively faith 
engraveth the vertues of it upon the soul 
he that believeth in christ crucified 
is made like unto christ in love 
meekness 
and all other graces that he manifesteth in his death 
thus the heart is framed to meekness 
and by invincible arguments taken from the same grounds 
faith perswades to patience 
for thus it pleadeth 
christ indured scoffs and reproaches 
rayling and reviling 
buffeting and scourging 
yea death it self 
and the anger of god 
more grievous then death 
not for any demerit of his 
but for our sakes 
and shall we grudge to suffer small injuries that are offered unto us by men 
at our saviour christs request 
seeing we have deserved far greater 
the man that duely considereth the sufferings of christ 
and certainly believeth that he deserveth what christ suffered 
cannot possibly give deniall to this reason 
4 
it submitteth to the absolute sovereignty of the lordrom 
1219 
and will not encroach upon his prerogative royal 
now all revenge is gods right 
and he hath not given it unto man 
vengeance is mine 
i will repay 
saith the lord 
it is not permitted a private man in the common-wealth 
that he take the place of a judge 
nor of a servant in the family 
that he usurpe the authority of the master 
and shall a christian 
by revenging his own quarrell in word and deed 
intrude himself into the office 
and usurpe upon the prerogative of the almighty god 
5 
faith worketh humility and lowliness 
banisheth self-love and loftiness of mind 
for it minds a man of his sinne and wickedness of his spirituall foolishness 
impotency 
nakedness 
and due desert of sinne 
what good soever is enjoyed 
it receiveth and holdeth as an almes of grace 
what misery is felt and suffered 
it acknowledgeth to be the true desert of sinne 
or the just chastisement of love 
it admireth the excellent majesty of god 
and
freely submitteth to his wisdom and will 
faith emptieth a man of all high conceits of self-sufficiency 
goodness 
and worth 
makes him most base and vile in his own eyes

wherefore it is no hard matter for a sound believer to put up reproach

if we esteem our selves to be but dust and ashes 
wormes and no men 
if in sincerity we can say unto corruption 
thou art my father 
and unto the worme 
thou art my mother and my sister 
if we did truly judge that by our sinnes committed against god and our neighbour 
we have deserved not onely contumelies and wrongs 
but also eternall death of body and soul 
we could not be easily provoked to anger upon every trifling occasion

seeing we have deserved farre greater

the preferment it gapes after is not of any earthly nature 
the riches it coveteth are above 
as for the things of this life 
it doth not desire much 
it delighteth not in much 
and consequently the believer is not much disturbed with unquietness 
nor incensed with anger 
when he is crossed in them 
he will not trouble himself needlesly to intermeddle with every domesticall trifle 
and if any thing miscarry 
he will not so much look to the means

faith begetteth soundness of spirit 
aad christian hardiness

inordinate lusts 
which are as ulcers in the flesh 
it subdueth 
and diffuseth the saving vertue of the word into every power of the soul

no more then sound flesh will ake to be handled 
8 
it seeketh the approbation of god 
but is not vainly inquisitive what others think 
speak 
or do 
for 
who so believeth 
shall find most sweetness in familiarity and communion with god 
which draweth the heart from the love of needless curiosity 
and the abandoning of this troublesome companion vain curiosity 
is of speciall use to the subduing of unjust anger 
for many things will neither grieve nor hurt us 
if we never see nor hear them 
whereas he that busily enquireth what is said against him in every company 
he that listneth at every door 
and under every wall 
he that rubbeth up ill words spoken against him in secret 
doth both disquiet himself with anger 
and make his own faults more publique

how many and great injuries we have offered to our brethren 
the remembrance whereof is a great curbe and bridle to carnall anger

would think with himself

for no man without blushing could extreamly punish those faults in his neighbour 
for which he shall need to crave pardon himself

experience sheweth 
that the greatest heat abroad is accompanied with least heat at home

for it deferreth to censure 
till time have revealed the truth 
it is the nature of men 
to be most desirous of hearing that which most displeaseth them

namely 
that he is a brother created in the image of god 
it calleth to mind the equity which we look for at the hands of all men 
and causeth a man to set himself in the place of him with whom we are provoked 
if we wrong any man 
we desire that he would forgive us 
and therefore we must forgive him the injury that he doth unto us 
without unjust anger 
these considerations will keep men that they shall not aggravate those injuries which are offered them 
nor extenuate those they offer others 
13 
it is the property of faith to receive the whole word 
and to diffuse the saving vertue thereof into every power of the soul 
which changeth us into the nature of it self 
but the word of god requireth meekness 
long-suffering 
and patience 
the word of the kingdom is compared to leaven

shall be measured unto thee again 
and returned into thine own bosome 
while thou remainest in anger 
thou canst have no assurance that thy prayers are acceptably heard of god 
or that thou art his child by grace and adoption 
what christian 
that knoweth the comfort of prayer 
and dignity of adoption 
would not be terrified from unadvised anger by such like rebukes and threatnings
q 
what meanes further should a christian use to subdue anger
a 
1 
we must fly all affairs that are above our reach 
lest that finding our selves opprest 
as with an unsupportable burden 
grief kindle our waywardness and choler 
2 
it is good to abstain from multitude of business 
because not onely the mind is distracted and disturbed therewith 
and so made a fit inne for anger to lodge in 
but also because in such abundance of business 
some things of necessity will miscarry 
and among such a multitude of irons 
some will burn 
and so inflame the mind to anger 
3 
another meanes to prevent anger 
is to avoid the company of those who are angry and cholerick 
lest by a certain contagion they poyson us with their passions 
and this solomon teacheth us 
make no friendship with an angry manprov 
2224 
neither go with the furious man 
lest thou learn his waies 
and receive destruction to thy soul 
drunkards provoke to drink 
voluptuous men mollifie the most couragious 
and avarice poysons those that haunt the covetous 
in like manner 
cholerick men infuse into us their troublesome humour 
or at least in frequenting them we expose our selves to the dangers of quarrels with them 
for as one stick of wood being set on fire 
doth kindle that which is next unto it 
so one man being inflamed with anger 
inflameth them also who are near about him 
with his provocations 
4 
if we would subdue angervitiae facilius repelluntur 
quam expellunter 
sen 
we must avoid contentious controversies 
for howsoever it be very easie to abstein from them before they are begun 
yet after a man is entred into them 
he cannot easily give them over 
because he thinketh that it will derogate from his wit and judgement 
if he be forced to yeeld though it be to a truth 
and besides men naturally desire to bring others to be of their opinion 
and therefore they will use great earnestness to perswade 
and oftentimes burst out into anger and fury 
if they cannot obtein their desire 
5 
to prevent anger it is good to take heed of medling with the strife that belongs not to usprov 
2617 
prov 
299 
especially we should take heed of medling with foolish and indiscreet persons 
for he that contendeth with the foolish 
whether he rage or laugh 
there is no rest 
6 
the sovereign remedy of anger 
is to cast our eyes upon the examples of patience which the servants of god and the saints have taught us in this world 
as of abraham 
who when just cause of offence was offered by lot and his shepherds 
was rather content to part from his rightgen 
138 
then he would any way discord and dissent 
of moses 
who then was ready to pray for the people 
when they were ready to stone him

when he was provoked by the outragious injuries of shimei 
did notwithstanding contein himself 
and of stevenact 
760 
who when the stones flew about his eares 
prayed for his enemies that threw them at him1 et 
222 
but especially we should fix our eyes upon the example of our saviour christ 
who being outraged by men did not curse them 
being persecuted 
he did not threaten his executioners 
being crucified 
he prayed for his enemies 
and who in the end by a philosophy farre different from that of the world 
hath put our salvation in his cross 
our triumphs in his reproaches 
and our glory in his punishments 
the looking upon green colours is not more sovereign for those who are troubled with inflamation of the eyes 
then the beholding of the clemency and patience of others 
is for those whose hearts are enflamed with anger 
7 
if the examples will not move us to the love of mildness and patience 
let us set before our eyes those men that abandon themselves to fury 
so shall we easily discerne in others 
what an ugly and bruitish vice it is in our selves 
one saith 
that if an angry man would look himself in the glass in the midst of his fury 
he would appear so horrible in his own sight 
that it would be a notable meanes to work an hatred in his heart 
of so deformed a vice 
doth not the furious man disrobe himself of all shame 
lose all reason
renounce all moderation and modesty 
is not his countenance disfigured and unseemly 
are not his words absurd 
his actions rude 
can he refrain his tongue 
or contain the other parts of his body in their duty 
wherefore as in seeing the shamefull motions of them that are drunk 
we conceive a certain horror of the excess of wine 
so when we behold the deformity of choler in others 
we should endeavour what we can not to be infected with a vice 
which is as it were a reproach to humane nature 
8 
we must fly jealousies and suspicions 
which many times incense us 
as well as the justest subjects of choler 
for that taking in ill part a look 
a smile 
or some other light action 
we conceive a despight and grow hot against the innocent 
who had no desire to wrong us 
9 
we must not lightly give credit to what we hear reported 
considering the practises which are used at this day to abuse the most credulous 
a flatterer will seek to insinuate himself into favour by accusing an innocent 
he will suggest an outrage and make a bad discourse to perswade that he hath heard it with grief of mind 
another will seek an occasion to dissolve the most sacred bonds of friendship 
another full of venome and poyson will desire to have the sport of a quarrell 
and will be glad to be spectator of a combate which he hath kindled 
so as he be none of the party 
it is then a notable lightness to condemn a friend suddainly before he be heard 
and without an exact knowledge of the matter whereof he is accused 
and it is a prodigious in justice to be incenced against him before that he know who accuseth him 
or what crime is imposed upon him 
10 
as for those things whereof we our selves are witnesses 
we must consider the disposition and will of those that have done us wrong 
if it be a young man 
let us impute it to his age 
and bear with his youth 
is it a father 
having received so many other benefits from him 
it is reason we should endure 
and that remembrance of things past should mollifi our present bitternessas for the injury 
see it not 
feele it not 
overcome it
melius est non agnoscere 
quam ignoscere and we must duely consider with our selves whether he hath not just cause to entreat us with that rigor 
whereof we now complain 
if they be persons subject to an higher power 
it may be they have been forced 
and being solicited by such as they could not disobey 
another may offend us after that he hath been outraged by us 
and what wonder is it if he requite us with the like 
if it be a good man 
we should not think that he had any will to hurt us 
being confident of his innocency 
if he be a wicked man 
why are we amazed if the effects resemble the cause 
moreover 
if we think our selves wrongfully oppressed 
let us remember that many times we think that unjust 
which is not so in effect 
in a word 
we must remember that we know not his heart 
nor his intention 
it may be he meant better unto us 
neither are we acquainted with the strength of his temptation 
which perhaps was such as would have overthrown us 
nor the reason why the lord suffereth him to be overcome 
and fall by it

a 
if through infirmity we be fallen into injust angereph 426 
we must abandon this corrupt affection with all possible speed 
anger is as poyson 
which with all speed must be purged out if it be taken unawares

whom they strive to smother as soon as they are disclosed 
the apostle teacheth us to lay aside anger with all possible speed 
let not the sun go down on your wrath 
as the night doth cool the heat which in the day time the sun hath made 
so must it also quench the flames of anger kindled in our hearts 
and as it is easie to quench a fire of straw in the beginning 
but if we suffer it to take hold of more solid matter 
it passeth all our labour and industry 
and makes a pitifull ruin 
even so 
he that will observe choler from the beginning 
seeing it begin to fume and kindle for some light quarrell and small offence 
it is easie for him to suppress it 
and to stay the course 
but if it be once setled and begins to swell 
and that he himself blowes the bellowes 
that is to say 
if he stirres it up and enflames it 
it will be hard for him afterwares to quench it 
a small spark if it be nourished 
will quickly increase to a furious flame 
as therefore when a house is newly set on fire 
men labour earnestly 
and with all speed to quench it 
before it have taken hold of the main posts and great beams 
otherwise it will be too late afterwards 
when it is increased to its full strength 
so when our hearts are first set on fire with anger 
we are presently to quench it with the water of the spirit 
for after we are throughly enflamed 
it will be too late to apply any remedy till the flame have spent it self 
but some will say 
i fall into anger many times when i never mean it 
and it hath overcome me before i am aware 
how therefore should i prevent that which i do not foresee 
or free my self from it 
seeing it violently over-ruleth me 
to which i answer 
first 
that if we carefully watch over our selves 
we shall easily perceive when we are inclining to anger 
for as there are many signs which go before a storm 
and many symptoms which discover diseases before we fall into them 
so we may easily discern in us many notes and signes of this tempestuous storm and raging fever of minde 
unjust anger 
before it break forth and shew it self 
inward pain 
swelling of heart 
discontent and bitterness of spirit appear before it 
secondly 
anger doth not presently as soon as it is entred into the heart over-rule us 
before it be grown to greater strength than it hath at the first 
for as the greatest fire hath but a small beginning 
and when it is begun is easily quenched 
so the most furious anger attaineth not his full strength at the first entrance 
but by little and little encreaseth like a flame 
by taking hold of new matter 
and therefore howsoever after it hath wholly inflamed a man 
it is most hardly quenched 
yet in the beginning thereof 
it is easily suppressed 
the means to subdue anger after it hath given the assault 
are 
first 
not to yeeld any obedience to her 
nor to beleeve her in any thing she saith or doth 
to inflame us to revenge 
as they that are sick of the falling-sickness 
having any sign or beginning of their fit 
retire themselves suddenly 
and take all the remedies which may divert so troublesome an accident 
or at least 
hide the shame 
so they that see themselves transported with choler 
should retain themselves 
and strive to moderate their
passion 
and divert the infirmity which seeks to seize upon them 
pilots foreseeing a tempest 
usually retire themselves into a road or under the lee of some rock 
before the storm come 
so he that feels the first motions of choler 
should have recourse to reason or faith rather 
and oppose her perswasions to the passion 
to controle the violence of it 
we find in other passions 
that the liberty we give them brings some ease 
but choler grows bitter 
and is incensed by the liberty that we give her 
and is enflamed the more in that we give way to her furyprov 
1216 
prov 
203 
&amp 
1632 
secondly 
we must remember that it is a dishonest thing to requite an injury 
for he that doth so hath part of the wickedness 
and entangles himself in sinne 
as he that embraceth a sooty person 
and walloweth with him 
shall be sooty himself 
ctesipho pancratista is worthily derided 
who was wont to kick his mule 
because she strook him with the heels 
if another man vex me 
shall i vex my self 
we must rather imitate champions 
who sometimes give ground 
that they may overcome 
thirdly 
to subdue anger we must withdraw the food wherewith it is nourished 
for as the greatest fire 
if new matter be not supplied 
will of it self go out 
so the most furious anger will soon be mitigated 
if it be not continually nourished with a new supply of matter 
the fewell of anger 
is multiplying of words 
for though the injury at the first be small 
yet if either it be aggravated by him that suffereth it 
or defended by him that offereth it 
it incenseth men to great anger 
as nothing sooner than winde 
causeth a small spark to burst out into a furious flame 
so nothing sooner doth cause a small spark of anger increase to a raging flame of revenge 
than the wind of words 
we are not therefore to imagin with some 
that we can disgorge our stomacks of anger 
by vomiting out spleen in bitter words 
for they do not only in their own nature whet and sharpen our own affections 
but also provoke the other 
with whom we are offended 
to requite us with the like 
and so to add new matter to the old flame 
as well therefore may we think to quench the fire with wood 
as anger with words 
for as wood is the nourishment of the fire 
so words are the nourishment of anger 
let us rather in our anger imitate the wise socrates 
who when he was most angry 
used most modesty 
mildness of speech 
and lowness of voice 
and so withdrawing the nourishment from the fire of angerdiffer

it will soon of it self be extinguished 
fourthly 
in thine anger make some delay 
before thou speakest or doest any thing 
give not place to wrath 
let it not have vent by sudden or unadvised words 
anger smothered will languish 
but let out 
will flame unto further mischief 
solomon makes it the property of a wise man to conceal anger 
a fools wrath is presently known 
but a prudent man covereth shame 
memorable is that answer of athenodorus to augustus 
who being requested at his departure to leave behind him some good instruction for the government of his empire 
gave him this advice 
that he should do nothing in his anger 
before he had numbred on his fingers the letters of the greek alphabet 
an example hereof we have in socrates 
who finding his anger incensed against his servant 
deferred to take correction 
saying 
i would beat thee but that i am angry 
and also in plato 
who being provoked to anger for some notable fault committed by his servant 
took a cudgell into his hands 
and held it over him a good space 
as if he would have stroken 
and being asked of his friend speusippus 
what he meant by such a kind of action 
i said he 
i take punishment of one who is angry 
meaning of himself 
by bridling his affection 
and that we may the rather be moved to abstain from sudain and desperate resolutions when our anger is provoked 
let us consider we are in great danger to do those things in a moment 
which we shall repent our whole life 
that in such shortness of time we cannot rightly examin the circumstances of the matter 
which in such cases are most material 
whereas truth is the daughter of time 
and will bring all to light 
that it is a foul shame 
first to be angry 
and then to judg 
first to take punishment 
and then to examine the
cause 
that is to say 
whether hath offended 
he that taketh punishment 
or he on whom it is inflicted 
whereas in process of time the truth will appear 
whether revenge may be more justly taken or omitted- and then if after due examination he inflict deserved punishment 
it will be more effectuall for the reformation of the offender 
when he seeth that it doth rather proceed from true judgment 
than from the spleen 
fiftly 
it is good to get out of the company of others 
especially of them who have offended us 
according to the example of jonathan 
who being justly provoked by his unjust and cruell father1 sam 
2034 
rose from the table and departed 
lest by his fathers provocations 
he might have done or said that which did not beseem him 
whose practise if we would wisely imitate 
we should not only appease our anger 
by removing out of our sight the object and cause thereof 
and prevent further occasions of increasing it 
but also cover our infirmities 
which otherwise we should discover by the violence of the passion 
for this affection is as fire 
take the matter away from fire 
and it will cease to burn 
so let a man depart 
and employ himself 
for the time 
some other way 
and he shall soon cease to be angry 
sixthly 
we are to consider that we sinne again god 
not once or twice 
but often 
yea every day 
and therefore the course of our anger must be turned against our selves 
seventhly 
let the angry man think with himself 
whether he is purposed ever or never to lay aside his anger 
if ever 
how much better were it that he should vanquish it 
than that it should leave him 
that he should vanquish it 
than that it should be overcome of it self 
that he should quench it with the water of the spirit 
than that it should last untill it burn out 
for not only this but all other passions in time tire themselves 
and fall down with their own ruin 
but if they purpose to live in perpetuall enmity 
let them consider that they nourish in themselves a viper 
which will fret out their own bowels 
for who receiveth more vexation 
grief 
and disquietness by anger 
than himself who is subject to the passion 
and what doth sooner cut off the thread of life 
than the sharpness of fretting grief 
lastly 
let him think with himself what good time he spendeth in a bad matter 
which being so short and precious 
should be more esteemed and better employed 
eighthly 
the chief means to subdue anger after it hath taken hold of us 
is earnest and hearty prayer unto god 
that he would vouchsafe us the gracious assistance of his holy spirit 
whereby our affections may be so ruled and sanctified 
that they being freed from naturall corruption 
may be made fit and serviceable for the setting forth of his glory 
the good of our brethren 
and the furthering of our own salvation 
for it is only the water of the spirit and the shield of faith 
which is able to quench the fury of our passions 
and prayer is a chief means to obtain these spirituall graces at gods hands

so anger cannot long endure

for as it is not fit to minister physick to a sick patient 
while he is in a fit of an ague 
and therefore well-advised physicians rather make choice of their patients good day 
so it is in vain for a man to seek the curing of anger by good counsell 
unless he stay till the fit be passed over 
and the heat of anger somewhat asswaged 
for a man cannot 
nor will not hearken to another mans reasons 
while he is subject to his own passions 
and as a man heareth nothing almost which is said 
when is house is on fire 
for the noise of the multitude 
the crackling of the flame 
and the perturbation of his own mind 
so the violence of this affection 
and the fury of this passion 
doth make a man while he is in a fit of rage 
deaf to all reason 
a ship without a pilote in a tempest 
will as soon receive a governour from another place 
as a man will admit the speech of another 
whilest he is tossed to and fro with the waves of anger 
and therefore they are to be admonished when the fury hath somewhat spent itself 
and the great evils of anger both in respect of their souls and bodies 
their neighbours and friends 
the church and common-wealth 
are as it were in one view 
to be presented to their more sober meditations 
but they who admonish are to remember 
that they use all mildness and moderation in their admonition 
lest while they go about to prevent anger for the time to come 
they presently provoke it 
for if they be too austere and rough in using too insolent invectives and bitter reprehensions 
they do not onely commit themselves a great absurdity 
while in reproving anger they shew their own spleen 
but also make their admonition altogether unprofitable 
because the angry man 
if he see them so sharp and severe 
will rather think how he may defend his fault by aggravavating the injuries which he hath received 
then either confess it to such a cynick censurer 
or labour to amend it 
for as no man will suffer his wound to be searched by such a surgeon as hath a rough hand 
and an hard heart 
neither will any patient commit himself to the cure of a froward and merciless physician 
so man cannot abide 
and therefore much less an angry man 
to have his gauled faults too much rubbed 
and the wounds and diseases of his mind healed and cured with too sharp a corasive and loathsome potion of insolent and bitter words 
as the fearfull snake 
when he hath no meanes to fly away 
will turn again 
and desperately leap into the face of him that pursueth him 
and the dog that is hardly pursued with a cudgell 
will turn again when he cannot fly away 
so the angry man being so hardly pursued with sharp invectives and bitter reprehensions 
that he hath no evasion of excuse to cover his fault 
nor hope of pity by confessing it 
doth as it were fly into the face of the reprover 
by objecting his greater faults 
that they may serve to extenuate his 
which are less 
5 
humble submission doth allay choler 
anger ceaseth against them that behave themselves in lowly manner 
because they seem to confess themselves inferiours 
the lyons tear not the beasts that prostrate themselves before themgen

when it was in their power

many gifts and good turns are of great force to appease and reconcile the minds that are seperated by anger

reasons to perswade to the right exercise of mildness

how mildness and true zeal may stand together

he must 
and that for these reasons 
1 well ordered mildness is excellent in all men 
for that it is a bud of true humility 
and a lively character of the children of god 
but it hath a greater luster and a more eminent shew when it is found in the souls of kings and monarches of the earth 
for what praise 
what triumph 
and what glory is it to a great prince 
to have the command of so many millions of men 
to be arbitratour of their lives 
to be master of their goods and fortunes 
to be able at an instant to leavy fearfull armies 
and in the twinkling of an eye to ruine towns and countries 
without the fear of any laws 
and yet in this prodigious power 
not to suffer his eyes to be dazled with so great a splendor 
nor to be transported with choler 
and in offences not to use severity 
to contein his passions 
and to make it his whole glory to do good to those that are subject to his authority 
wherefore this bounty and clemency in princes 
makes them not onely to be beloved 
but even to be adored by their subjects 
who are ravished with a sweet excess of joy 
when as they see themselves subject to a power which hath nothing insolent 
but all things tend to their preservation 
and propound to themselves no more glorious objects then their safety 
mildness and clemency 
as a powerfull charm 
bind the affections of the subject unto the prince 
and purchase their love 
which is the most powerfull bond and safest guard whereby monarches may assure their estates1 reg

when the people by great transgression had provoked the lord

his anger was kindled against job

when it is informed 
quickned and determined by faith

and in what things to shew forth all mildnessprov 
334 
according to the example of our heavenly father 
the proper acts of this mildness are 1 
to suffer the duties and threats of the law to be pressed upon us without grudging or stomack 
2 
to calme and quiet the heart that it be not disturbed or troubled1 pet

either for the prosperous success of the wicked

3 
to incline the affections unto a mild and courteous 
loving and kind carriage towards our neighbour 
not permitting the heart easily to be overcome with bitterness 
not permitting the possessour hastily or violently 
either to offer to another 
or remove from himself such injuries 
a mild man doth seldom think himself to be contemned or mocked 
and if he be derided or disgraced 
he beares it with an equall and quiet mind 
hence he becomes a more severe inquirer into himself 
that if any thing be truly spoken 
he might
seriously amend it 
if it be false 
he doth neither complain bitterly 
nor grievously expostulate 
but command himself the more strictly not to be lifted up with any desire of revenge 
he is ever calme 
quiet 
enduring just and unjust 
patient of reproach 
abstaining from all inward sedition 
he is never puffed up for those things which he hath 
but ever humble in respect of those things which he hath not 
whose mind is so appeased 
qualified 
sober and temperate 
that he never preferres himself to any 
all to himself

q 
if mildness must be shewed to all men 
how may we warrant any anger against any man in any sinne or offence 
or how may any severity be put on against any offender
a 
mildness is no enemy to true zeal 
for both are graces of the spirit 
that cannot be cross to each other 
christians mistake this grace 
when they dream it to be a bottomless charity 
and under pretence of mildness 
can bear with any evil 
which indeed is nothing else but an irreligious and mute approbation and association in the evil 
he that commandeth to be angry 
but not to sinne 
maketh it a sin not to be angry sometimes 
neither did the meekness of moses hinder 
but that he might be exceeding angry at the calf they had made 
whence it followeth 
that publique persons must publikely suppress 
and reprove open sinnes 
disturbing the publique proceedings of religion or justice 
so david put on zeal to weed the wicked out of the landpsal 
1018 
tit 
113 
and the minister is taught 
if he see beasts or slow bellies 
to reprove them sharply 
the private person must privately also 
but yet plainly reprove his brother 
and not suffer his sinne upon him 
or at least by shewing his indignation against sinne 
he must free his own soul from the guilt of it 
as also the punishment 
yea 
from the suspicion of it in such as may be present 
who else may think him that holdeth his tongue a partner 
or of conset with the sinner 
gentleness doth favour sinne no more then zeal or indignation 
onely it moderateth passion 
that it break not out into revenge and fury
q 
what then is the ʋse of mildness
jam 
313a 
to purifie our zeal 
for so the apostle james would have a wise man to shew forth his good conversation in meekness of wisdom 
which meekness of wisdom or wise mildness 
first 
causeth a man to put a difference between the person and the sin 
and affecteth him with pity to the person 
even in revenge of the sinne 
so joshua called achan 
my son 
when yet presently he executed the judgment of death upon him 
secondly 
between sinne and sinne 
for some are motes troubling the eye 
some are beames putting out the eye 
a mote may soon be blown away and removed 
a beame requireth more strength 
wise meekness will more shew it it self in the one 
and more retire it self in the other 
again 
some sinnes are more directly injurious to men 
and perhaps the party himself 
others more injurious to god 
now this meekness of wisdom will be queen in the former 
but giveth place to zeal in the latter 
thirdly 
it discerneth beteween sinner and sinner 
for all sinners are not of a suit 
some sinne of ignorance 
some against their light and knowledge 
some of weakness 
some of set purpose 
and obstinate wickedness 
some are leaders and setters of sinne 
some are led and seduced 
some seek excuses as ashamed of that they have done 
others defences 
as glorying in their iniquity 
now cometh this meekness of wisdom 
and putteth difference 
shewing compassion on some 
and others saving with fear 
fourthly 
it omitteth no opportunity of saving and pardoning that may stand with justice 
it blotteth out the fault 
it lifteth up him that is fallen 
it recalleth the wanderer from the labyrinths of errours into
the way of innocency by mild perswasions 
long forbearance 
and gentle admonitions
q 
what motives may perswade us to the continuall and uniforme prastice of mildness
a 
1 
the mild person is subject 
and well-affected to god in all things 
profitable to all men 
even his enemies 
and hath obtained dominion over himself 
2 
the lord hath speciall care of the mild and humblepsal 
912 
psal 
1476 
psal 
1494 
when they cry he will hear their prayers 
in distresses he will send them succour and deliverance 
the lord will lift up the meek 
and beautifie them with salvation 
3 
well-ordered mildness is the heap of all vertues 
so that there can be the utter want of none where this appeareth 
and though she boast not her self in any wise 
yet she is most conspicuous in the renowned assembly of vertues 
to whom god doth abundantly restore what she detracteth from her self 
but he that is destitute of this grace 
him god knoweth not 
men hate 
to him we attribute no sound grace 
but onely the images of grace which vanish 
4 
christian mildness is an argument of a sound couragious mind 
he is of a noble and generous spirit 
that 
as it is the manner of valiant wild beasts 
doth securely hear the barking of dogs

goodness 
sufficiency

a quiet heart lodgeth with a base conceit of our selves 
2 
it is necessary we should acquaint our selves with our weakness and misery 
nakedness and sinne 
what creature is more feeble than man 
more exposed to divers and sundry chances 
more easie to be cast down

what is man but dust 
in respect of soul 
what more ignorant 
more prone to error 
vanity and baseness 
how greedy in sinne 
how averse to that which is good

whomsoever truth hath brought to this confession of his own infirmity 
he hath much profited 
for by this descent we come to that ascent which leadeth to the highest of all things 
he becomes good who first acknowledgeth himself not good 
pride that is fast riveted in the heart 
is not drawn forth without great sense of grief

and the sonne hath given his bloud 
and the holy ghost hath sprinkled the same upon your hearts 
for the washing away of all your iniquities 
stand not with men for small petty injuries 
but forgive and forget them 
and assuredly whosoever hath the comfortable feeling of the pardon of his sinnes 
cannot but be so minded 
for faith in the bloud of christ quieteth the conscience 
pacifieth the heart

as he is advanced of god

peaceable 
humble disposition of soul 
is the proper seat of mildness he that beleeveth for the pardon of his offences 
is sensible of his own wants and the riches of gods grace 
which causeth self-deniall

whence issueth gentleness

but fierce and outragious against true godliness

when the infirmities of the godly be pursued with all bitterness and rigour 
for in this case godliness is persecuted 
not sinne 
2 
dissolute lenity or stupidity 
when men are stirred with nothing that befalleth 
cometh under the name of mildness

4 
carnall sottishness 
when men are cool and remiss in whatsoever concerns the glory and worship of god 
but hot and fiery in that which toucheth their state or name 
is abusively called mildness 
but more truly irreligiousness

but hot and fiery in others of no greater consequence 
or gentle and quiet in some presence 
for fear or desire of praise 
but ragaing mad with them that be under their government 
is the fruit of naturall corrupt disposition 
not of lively faith

superficiall or sleighty mildness

christ is the prince of peace 
whose subjects after the example of their lord and master 
must be lowly and live peaceably 
it is for doggs and swine to bark and bite one another 
but for sheep or lambs to rent and tear each other 
all men would wonder at it 
if then we profess that christ is our shepheard 
and we his sheep 
how can we with any honesty look him in the face 
when we so farre differ from the nature and properties of his sheep in eating up our own hearts with griefs 
and ministring continuall vexation unto others 
2 
if we esteem it baseness to yeeld unto our brother 
we must know it is rebellion to strive against god 
who is our most absolute sovereign 
able to save or destroy 
but if we give place to wrath 
we fight against god 
who is the principall author of our sufferings

true christian love is not provoked

our own disstempered lusts are the cause of all contention and strife 
christ jesus had as great wrongs as ever man in this world had 
yet was he never in any passion or distemper 
and why 
because he was quite void of all carnall affections 
before his conversion paul was very boisterous and full of rage 
but after that he had spent the heat of his anger upon his own great sinnes 
he that had been very froward 
became very meek 
and was able with patience to undergo imprisonment

for the best that can be said for it 
is this 
that it is beastly and fleshly reason 
such as the lord esteemeth folly and frensie 
and enmity against his majesty 
which will bring with it death and destruction of body and soul 
if we yeeld unto it 
and be led by it 
all sound reason teacheth us quietly to submit our selves to the providence of god 
whose hand must be acknowledged in every thing that hapneth unto us
a 
should not a man be angry at sinne
a 
sinne is the proper object of just and lawfull anger 
but many times this excuse is made to cover and hide the deformity of unjust and carnall anger 
let us examine the matter a little first 
do you hate your own sins 
have they caused you as often to break your sleep as the injuries of others 
are you as much displeased with your selves for offences committed against god or man 
as with your neighbour 
wife or child 
for the supposed wrong he hath done unto you 
to preend grief for anothers sinne 
when you have little or none for your own 
is nothing else but plain dissimulation 
secondly 
such as grieve for the faults of others 
and are desirous to reform them 
will use a good and discreet order in dealing with the parties 
observing all circumstances for that end 
as namely 
the circumstance of time 
that they will not presently upon the committing of the offence fly in their faces in the view of all the standers by 
seeking to disgrace
them to the utmost 
but will waite the fittest opportunity 
when with most benefit and least blemish to the party 
they may cure him of his corruption 
then as every sinne is greater 
so they will be more incensed against it 
and herein doth the sinne of many appear 
that they will be more moved at some small offence 
wherein they themselves are touched 
then at a farre greater matter 
that nothing concernes their credit and commodity 
though it do never so much concerne gods glory 
thirdly 
if any be displeased at sinne 
he will use all good means for the healing thereof 
he will reprove and admonish 
and exhort 
and all from a loving and mercifull heart 
yea 
he will joyn unto these hearty prayer for a blessing upon his endeavours 
this we see in moses 
he was very angry against the sinne of the israelites in making the golden calf 
and shewed his just anger in executing judgment upon the ring-leaders in that hanious offence 
but withall we must note that he was never more fervent in prayer for themexo 
3211 
then at that time 
those therefore that are so far moved 
that they cannot speak unto the offenders in giving them good and loving advice 
nor speak for them unto god in putting up hearty and earnest requests 
such may be assured that their anger is not the zeal of the spirit 
but the heat of the flesh 
which they can have no comfort in 
but must be humbled for it

what we are to understand by the flesh 
and what by the spirit 
how these two can be said to fight together 
the properties of these enemies 
reasons to shew that the flesh is a most dangerous enemy 
with sundry encouragements to undertake this combate
question 
the saints of god that are sanctified in every part 
are sanctified but in part 
and not able to exercise their mind 
will and affections as they ought 
let us therefore consider the fruit of their imperfection in grace 
and what followeth thereupon
a 
from this 
that every child of god is truly renewed 
not perfectly sanctified 
followeth that spiritual combate or warfare between the flesh and spirit 
which only the regenerate 
and every regenerate man feels in himself more or less 
according to the measure of grace received 
and care to exercise himself in all things according to the word of god 
the enemies which thus fight with one another are the flesh and the spirit 
with an innumerable army of their motions and lusts 
both which with all their forces dwell in every true christian 
making mutuall opposition 
the one nilling what the other willeth 
and hindering and destroying what the other furthereth and advanceth 
this plainly appeareth by the scriptures 
which both discover this hostile dissention and contrary faction in the same manioh

christ was put to death concerning the flesh 
that is 
his humane nature 
his body being severed from his soul 
we wrestle not with flesh and blood 
that is 
only or principally with men

my spirit shall no longer contend with man

then needs must the children be polluted with their corruptionrom 
88 
they who are in the flesh 
that is 
remain in that corrupt and sinfull condition in which they were born 
cannot please god 
fourthly 
it is taken for that quality of corruption 
frailty and infirmity of the humane nature 
which is not sinne 
but rather the effect and punishment which attendeth and waiteth upon itpsal

thus the apostle saith 
that though he walked in the flesh 
yet he did not warre after the flesh 
not with weak and carnall 
but with strong and mighty weapons 
which were able to cast down all that opposed against them 
and in this sense may that speech of our saviour be understoodmat 
2641 
the spirit indeed is willing 
but the flesh is weak 
fifthly 
the flesh is taken for the whole corruption of nature 
or for that original sinne 
whereby the whole nature of man 
with all the faculties and powers of his soul 
are defiled 
in which sense it noteth that mass of corruption and sinke of filthiness which dwelleth in all men till they be renewed by grace 
or those reliques and remainders of sinne which abide still in the regenerate

as where the apostle saith 
that when we were in the flesh 
the motions of sinne which were by the law did work in our members 
to bring forth fruit unto death 
in the latter we are to understand it 
when it is applied unto the faithfull 
who are but in part regenerate 
to signifie the vitious quality of sinne 
which still abideth and remaineth in them unmortified and unsubdued 
so the apostle would have the incestuous person delivered to satan1 cor

that the spirit might be saved in the day of the lord jesus

515 
the flesh lusteth against the spirit
q 
by what reasons may it be shewed 
that the body or sensitive faculties are not meant by the flesh
a 
first 
in the whole course and current of the scriptures we may observe 
that there is much more spoken of the sinfull corruption of the soul 
then of the body 
and in the soul 
not only of the inferiour 
sensitive and animall faculties 
but also of the superiour and intellectuall 
as of the corruption and depravation of the mind2 cor 
71 
understanding 
reason 
wisdom and will 
having therefore 
saith the apostle 
these promises 
let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit 
where he necessarily implieth 
that both in himself 
and in those
beloved saints to whom he writeth 
there was remaining corruption and filthiness of nature 
which was to be purged away 
not only in the body which is here signified by the flesh 
but also in the soulrom 
87 
eph 
23 
tit 
115 
which is here understood by the spirit 
ʋnto the pure all things are pure 
but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure 
but even their mind and conscience is defiled 
and this is taught in those exhortationsrom 
121 
eph 
423 
wherein we are called upon to labor after the renovation of the mind 
for it implies that not only the body and sensitive faculties are naturally corrupted 
but also the mind the chief part of man 
and hereof the spirit 
that is 
the prime vigour 
and chief faculty of the mindeph 
117 
18

and when the apostle prayeth unto god that the minds of the faithfull might be renewed 
doth he not intimate that they were by nature blind 
ignorant 
corrupt and filthy 
2 
the names 
acts and sinnes which are attributed to the flesh 
shew plainly that the corruption of soul is meant

3 
the flesh and the spirit are contrary one to the other 
and like mortall enemies in hostile manner they fight together 
seeking one anothers ruine and destruction 
but such enmity is not between the soul and body 
for then they would seek one anothers overthrow 
whereas contrariwise they mutually love and cherish the one the othereph

the soul chiefly sinneth 
and in it the mind and will 
it is the divels forge

and therefore the divel first poysoneth it the mind first conceiveth mischief 
or entertaineth the temptation 
then the judgment alloweth it 
if not simply 
yet in respect of some circumstance 
and so then the will chooseth 
and the heart affecteth it

and we should have no sinfull seditions 
and tumultuous uproares in the inferiour parts and members 
the body is but the servant of the soul in acting sinne

and the corruption of the soul alone is sinfull 
and as for the corruption of the body 
it is rather the punishment of sinne then sinne it self 
lastly 
even the faithfull and regenerate are tempted 
not only to sinnes wherewith the inferiour faculties of the soul are delighted 
as lust 
wantonness 
intemperance 
and the like 
but also unto such sinnes as properly belong to the understanding and will 
as errors 
heresies 
infidelity 
doubting of gods mercy

now of what are they thus tempted 
but as the apostle telleth us 
of their own concupiscence 
and therefore this concupiscence extendeth as well to the superiour 
as the inferiour faculties of the soul 
yea 
not only are they tempted 
but often foyled by yeelding to the tentation 
of which we need no other proof 
but that experience which every christian may have in himself 
if without partiality he will examine his own conscience 
and though the actions of eating 
drinking 
lusting 
and committing uncleanness 
are immediately from the sensuall concupiscence 
yet the corruption and sinfulness of these actions 
is from the mind and reason 
either because it bridleth not the appetite 
or pricketh it forward to excess 
because it taketh delight in these voluptuous
pleasures 
for not the body it self 
but the soul by the body taketh pleasure in eating 
drinking

q 
what are we to understand by the spirit in this matter

and sometimes more specially for some one of them 
secondly 
it signifies the soul of man 
even as the flesh is taken for the body 
but these are not opposites and enemies but dear friends 
who so intirely love 
that they sear nothing more then to be separated and to part company 
thirdly 
it is taken for that chief and excellent intellectual faculty of the soul 
called the mind 
and particularly for reason and understanding 
but neither can it here be taken in this sense 
because this spirit it self is corrupt and sensual 
and this natural reason and wisdom is enmity against god 
and against this spirit 
which opposeth and fighteth against it 
as against his chiefest enemy 
fourthly 
it signifieth the vigour and efficacy of the understanding 
as where the apostle exhorteth the ephesianseph 422 
luk 
115

act

to be renewed in the spirit of their mind 
fifthly 
by the spirit 
we understand the gifts and graces of the spirit 
as faith 
love 
hope 
joy 
and the rest 
which being fruits of the spirit 
do stand in opposition to the lusts of the flesh 
and in some sort do fight against them 
they being contrary the one to the other 
lastly 
the spirit signifieth a new quality of holiness 
created and wrought in us by the spirit of god 
whereby all the powers and faculties of the soul are renewed according to the image of god 
in wisdom 
holiness and righteousness 
which continually fighteth against the flesh with the lusts thereof 
in this sense we are to understand it in this matter

q 
how can those twain 
the flesh and the spirit fight together 
being two meer qualities
a 
1 
we must know 
that they are not severed asunder 
as though the flesh were placed in one part of the soul 
and the spirit in another 
but they are joyned and mingled together in all the faculties of the soul 
the mind or understanding part 
is not one part flesh 
and another spirit 
but the whole mind is flesh 
and the whole mind is spirit 
partly one 
and partly the other 
the whole will is partly flesh 
and partly spirit 
the flesh and the spirit 
that is 
grace and corruption not severed in place 
but in nature and reason to be distinguished 
as the ayr in the dawning of the day 
is not wholly light or wholly dark 
as at midnight and at noon-day 
neither is it in one part light 
in another part dark 
but the whole ayr is partly light and partly drak throughout 
in a vessel of luke-warme water 
the water it self is not only hot or only cold 
or in one part hot 
and in another part cold 
but heat and cold are mixt togerher in every part of the water 
so is the flesh and the spirit mingled together in the soul of man 
and this is the cause why these two contrary qualities fight together 
2 
we are not so to understand it 
as though this combate were only maintained by bare and naked qualities of renewed purity 
and old corruption 
but that they are also backed and upheld by those spirits which are the causes and authours of them 
namely 
the holy spirit of god 
and the impure and wicked spirit satan 
the authour of al sinne and wickedness 
for whilst men remain in the state of infidelity 
the strong man satan keepeth possession and dwelleth in them 
though not after a gross and sensible manner 
yet invisibly and spiritually 
ruling and reigning in them 
in which his regiment and government 
he imployeth the flesh and our carnal concupiscence as his deputy and chief instrument 
to lead sinfull men into all wickedness 
the which he continually strengtheneth 
enrageth 
animateth unto all evil
but when a stronger then he cometh 
even the good spirit of god 
he casteth him out 
and taking possession 
dwelleth 
reigneth 
and ruleth in our souls and bodies 
creating in us that quality of holiness 
and righteousness called the spirit 
which he substituteth a his vicegerent and chief deputy in the regenerate man 
nor doth the spirit of god leave the spiritual man to himself 
but continually sendeth unto him fresh aides of renewed graces whereby he is enabled to overcome
q 
what is the property of these enemies
a 
they are irreconcilable 
and can never be accorded 
till the one or the other be utterly subdued 
yea 
till the flesh be abolished 
for the spirit cannot be overcome 
but though the flesh cannot prevaile against the spirit 
yet we are to know 
that it is not an enemy to be contemned 
but exceeding pernicious and dangerous 
the mightiest and chiefest captain under the prince of darkness 
without whose help he could do little 
for though he should assault us with a huge army of his temptations 
and have his strength re-enforceed 
and even twice doubled with the aides of all worldly enemies 
yet they could do nothing if we did not yeeld unto their assaults 
or the inbred enemy did not betray us into their hands 
this is apparent in the example of our saviour christ 
who being free from the inward corruption of the flesh 
was not at all endangered with the outward temptations of the divel 
and whereas the hellish sparks of his suggestions fall into our corrupt hearts 
as it were 
into tinder or gun-powder 
by which they are nourished and much increased in their strength and violence 
they did no more work upon our blessed saviour 
whose pure nature was no jot tainted with carnall corruption 
then a weak dart that lighteth upon an impenetrable armour 
or a small spark of fire that should fall into a sea of water 
needs then must the flesh be a dangerous enemy 
seeing all danger is by and through it 
needs must it above all be most pernicious 
seeing it exposeth unto all mischief 
and nothing without it were able to hurt us 
if we be not greatly wanting to our selves 
as were our first parents
q 
how may it appear that the flesh is a most dangerous enemy
a 
1 
it is most malicious 
which appears in divers respects 
first 
that it is wholly evil 
the fountain of all evil 
the poysonous puddle from which do flow the stinking waters of all evils 
and this our saviour noteth 
whereas he saith 
that which cometh out of the man 
defileth himmark 
718 
so the apostle james maketh this carnall lust the mother 
as the divel is the father of all sin and wickedness 
from the inward concupiscence of the heart proceed evil thoughtsjam 
114 
15 
and so farre off is the law of god from stopping this flood of wickedness 
that it swelleth so much the higher 
and the opposition of gods will taketh occasion of greater rebellion 
breaking down all the bounds and banks that should stay and keep it in 
and as a wild beast or curst ban-dog groweth more fierce and enraged when they ar rsisted 
or when they are curbed in and tied uprom 
7 
so this savage flesh and sinfull corruption takes occasion by the knowledge of the law the more to transgress it 
and the more that it is checked and restrained 
the more violent it groweth in its wicked rage 
secondly 
it is in deadly hatred with the spiritual man 
continually disturbeth his peace 
undermineth his safety 
and is still plotting his ruine and destruction 
neither is it possible to conceive a more bitter opposition in all things 
then between the flesh and the spirit 
for what the spirit undertaketh 
the flesh crosseth 
what that furthereth 
this hindereth 
and at all times and upon all occasions the one nilleth 
what the other willeth 
in which respect it may easily be said that these two cannot reign and flourish in the same man at once 
for the prosperity of the one 
is the ruine of the other 
the kindling of fleshly lusts is the quenching of spiritual 
the nourishing of carnal concupiscence after earthly things 
is the choaking of spiritual concupiscence after that which is divine and heavenly 
thirdly 
the flesh is most tyrannous if it get
dominion 
for it subjecteth us unto most miserable bondage and servitude 
not suffering us to take any rest night nor day 
there is no estate so vile and abject as the state of a bond-slave 
nor no bondage comparable to the bondage of our lusts 
for what lust commandeth 
be it never so base 
hurtful 
dishonourable 
as sin ever is 
it must be done 
if unjust anger provoke to revenge 
they must kill and slay 
if filthy lust impose never so hard a task 
they must undertake it 
though it directly tend to the dishonour of god 
the ruine of their estates 
the staining of their fame 
the hazard of their lives 
and damnation of their souls 
if covetousness command the campassing of some wealth 
they must make no question of right or wrong 
of hurting other men or their own persons 
if ambition would have them to aspire to preferment 
they must not stick to tread all under foot that stand in the way 
they must lie and dissemble 
swear and forswear 
the gally-slave hath some rest in the night season 
but the flesh will not suffer men to be quiet at any time 
it solliciteth to sin continually 
sleeping and waking 
upon all occasions 
in all companies 
nature must have refreshing 
sin will never tire 
but what is the wages of this toylsome life

the flesh is a mighty and powerfull enemy 
for in the unregenerate it reigneth as a mighty monarch or cruel tyrant 
in the little world of man 
holding every faculty 
power and part of soul and body in subjection 
from whose force and power 
the sonnes of men are not able by any outward means afforded by nature 
or offered by grace 
to free themselves 
nay 
they neither can nor dare to attempt their liberty 
because their wils are no less captivated 
then their other parts and faculties 
and it is their chief delight to live in this slavery 
in the regenerate it is exceeding strong 
though not so puissant as in them that remain in their natural corruption 
for it maketh warre against the spirit 
doth often foyl and overcome the godly 
and carry them captive into the law of sinne 
when the godly resolve with themselves to keep the commandements of god 
what strong and manifold resistance do they find from the flesh 
3 
the policy of the flesh is more pernicious then its strengthjer 
179 
the heart of man is deceitfull above all things 
and desperately wicked 
howsoever satan the old serpent in respect of his natural abilities and long experience 
may be more cunning and politike in himself 
yet his deceit is not so great in abusing and wronging us 
as is the deceit of our own flesh 
for this being a part of our selves 
it is of the privy councill of our thoughts 
and knowing our most hidden imaginations 
and secret intentions 
it can take advantage of them to work to our overthrow 
now this fraud and policy of the fleshrom 
711 
is most pernicious 
in that it often prevaileth and much deceiveth us 
which tendeth unto our exceeding hurt 
even utter destruction 
moreover the danger of this deceit is so much the greater 
because it is so subtill and secret 
so deep and disguised 
that it can hardly be discerned and found out 
our longest line cannot sound the bottom of this gulf 
our quickest and most piercing sight cannot discerne the multitude and strength of these subtile enemies 
4 
the flesh is a domesticall enemy 
that dwelleth with us 
yea in us 
it keepeth possession in the strong forts and castles of our minds and wils 
our hearts and affections 
where our chief strength and treasure lyeth 
it adhereth and inseparably cleaveth unto us 
as being a part 
and the greater part of our selves 
whereby the dangerousness of this enemy appeareth 
for he is near at hand 
that we can have no leasure and
opportunity to fit and prepare our selves for the conflict 
before his approach 
the warre he maketh is domesticall and intestine 
in our own bowels 
nay more 
here one person doth not fight against another

the same affection against the same 
love against love 
fear against fear 
hope against hope 
this enemy cleaving unto us in all places and at all times 
is ready to watch all occasions 
and to take all opportunities of doing us mischief 
laying traps and snares for us in all our enterprises 
do we undertake the performance of holy and religious duties 
why then it dogs and followes us to the exercises 
and distracts us with wordly cogitations and wandering thoughts 
and oppresses our minds with dulness 
drowsiness and carnal weariness 
are we imployed in the duties of our callings 
it will make us negligent and lazy 
and carry us away with carnal pleasures 
or so wholly and earnestly intent on them 
that we shall spare no time for gods service 
nor for the enriching of our soules with spiritual treasure 
do we eat and drink to relieve and sustain our bodies 
it is ready to make our table a snare 
turning sufficiency into superfluity 
and necessary food into excess and belly-chear 
surfetting and drunkenness 
do we intend to refresh our selves with honest recreations 
it doth attend and wait on us 
moving us to consume a great part of our time in them 
which should be allotted to better exercises 
and even spend our strength and spirits in the immoderate use of them 
whereby instead of being refreshed and cheared 
we are disabled and made utterly unfit for the duties of christianity and of our callings 
and are so wholly taken up in the means 
that we neglect the main end for which we use them 
yea 
do we after our labours betake our selves to our rest 
when we lock our chamber doors 
we cannot shut out this enemy 
but whether we will or no 
it will be our bed-fellow 
and is alwaies ready at our lying down to distract us from any good meditations or serious examination of what we have done or omitted the day past 
to fill our minds with vain dreams and wicked imaginations 
and to oppress our nature instead of refreshing it 
whilst we give our selves to too much drowsiness 
5 
it is indefatigable and never wearied 
whereof it is that it is so impudently importunate 
that though it hath many repulses yet it will take no denial 
though in the conflict it be often beaten back and put to flight 
yet it will never quite leave the field 
but unite its scattered forces 
and receiving new aids and encouragements from the divell and the world 
it will afresh assault us and renew the fight 
herein resembling an hunger-starved dog who will by no means leave the house where he hath often been relieved 
but no sooner is beaten out of one door 
then he re-entreth into another 
yea 
oftentimes the more these fleshly lusts are resisted 
the more enraged and violent for the time they growpsal

and the means and medicines which god hath appointed to cure them 
make the disease but the more desperate 
6 
and lastly 
this combate between the flesh and the spirit 
is fought in a place of great disadvantage 
namely 
this world 
where the worser part hath many friends and strong aides 
even millions of wicked men 
and whole legions of divels 
and contrariwise the better part hath few friends 
many enemies
q 
what equality is there between these two combaters 
the flesh and the spirit
a 
the flesh usually is more in measure then the spirit 
the flesh is like the mighty gyant goliah 
and the spirit is little and small like young david 
the speech which is used of some divines 
that the regenerate man hath but the reliques of sin in him 
must be understood warily 
or it may admit an untruth 
for the measure of grace it can be but small in respect of coruption 
we
receive but the first fruits of the spirit in this liferom 
823 
which is but as a sheaf or two in comparison of the whole harvest 
and must wait for the accomplishment of our redemption till the life to come 
none can come to be tall men in christ 
according to the age of the fulness of christ 
till after this life
q 
what encouragements have we then to undertake this combate
a 
1 
the power and efficacy of the spirit is such 
that it is able to prevail ordinarily against the flesh 
for the flesh receives its deadly wound at the first instant of a mans conversion 
and continually dieth after by little and little 
and therefore it fights but as a maimed souldier 
but the spirit is continually confirmed and encreased by the holy ghost 
also it is lively and stirring 
and the vertue of it is like musk 
one grain whereof will give a stronger smell 
then many ounces of other perfumes 
some may say 
that the godly man doth more feele the flesh then the spirit 
and therefore that the flesh is every way more then the spirit 
we may answer 
that we must not measure our estate by feeling 
which may easily deceive us 
a man shall feele a paine which is but in the top of his finger more sensibly then the health of the body 
yet the health of the whole body 
is more then the paine of a finger 
to say nothing 
that the clear sight and sense of corruption 
is not attained by corruption 
but by grace 
in the state of corruption 
by the light of nature and externall instruction 
we may discerne many things to be out of order 
but the poyson of corruption and depth of sinne engraved in our flesh 
cannot be known without the light of grace 
2 
our grand captain jesus christ hath by his death overcome 
and led it captive upon the cross 
triumphing gloriously over it together with the rest of our spiritual enemies 
so as none of them shall be able to hurt us 
therefore when we are weak and tired in the fight 
let us fly to the standard and fight under the shield of christ our saviour 
who is so mighty and omnipotent that he is able to vanquish and overcome all our enemies alonerom 
723 
only he would have us to fight with him in the battell 
that so we might accompany him in his glorious triumph 
3 
we fight the lords battels 
and therefore he being on our side 
we are sure 
if we will but fight 
to obtain the victory in the end 
4 
though our spiritual part be but the first fruits 
yet it is an earnest of the whole harvest 
though small in quantity 
yet of greater power then the flesh 
greater is he that is in you1 joh 
44 
then he that is in the world 
the flesh indeed is a gyant in bigness and strength 
but such an one as being in a deadly consumption 
pineth away by little and little till it be wholly abolished 
5 
we have a wisedom to direct us in this fight 
in comparison whereof all the depth and craft of the flesh is but childish folly 
the lord hath given us his word to be our line 
which if we follow 
we shall find every creek and corner in our deceitfull hearts 
and discover by its light all their subtilties and crafty policies 
and prevent and disappoint them by the power of grace 
6 
as we are assured of victory if we will fight 
so of a glorious crown when we have overcome 
which should encourage us to suffer a little while the paines of this spiritual warfare 
when we are weary in running the christian race 
let us comfort and refresh our selves by having continually in our eye the goale and garland that is prepared for usheb 
122 
7 
unless we fight against the flesh 
we shall be led captive of it and kept in bondage 
nay 
we shall utterly perish in it 
joab encourageth his souldiers to fight against the syrians thus 
be of good courage 
and let us play the men2 sam 
1012 
for our people 
and for the cities of our god 
much greater cause hath each christian to bid battell to the flesh for the liberty of his soul 
and eternal salvation 
if we fight not 
we die 
if we make not resistance 
we shall go into captivity 
if we be at one with the flesh 
we are at enmity with god 
if we spare the flesh 
we destroy our souls 
but if we would prevaile 
we must be couragious 
vigilant 
circumspect 
and fervant in prayer for the assistance of the holy spirit in this conflict 
to strengthen us in the combate
and to renew and repair our wearied 
fainting and decayed graces 
that so receiving new life 
vigour and strength from him 
we may thereby be enabled to hold out unto the end 
8 
the rage of the flesh when we deal sharply with it 
is but like the fury of an enemy 
who hath received a mortal wound 
which if for the present he be resisted 
the blaze of his choler quickly goeth out 
and fainting in his strength 
he will fall at our feet 
it is but like the reluctation and resistance of a base-minded slave 
who by a few and small stripes is so enraged that he is ready to catch his master by the throat 
but if he be throughly hampered and soundly beaten 
he will fall down at his feet and bear what stripes he pleaseth to give him without resistance 
and therefore let us make this use of the rage of the flesh 
to be moved thereby to unite our forces 
and redouble our blows 
and then though it make never so many gallant bravadoes 
it will quickly yeeld 
and we shall be sure of an happy victory

concerning the subject of this combate 
in whom it is fought 
and how the flesh and the spirit being contrary 
can be said to consist in the same subject 
what this conflict is 
and whether it be in all the regenerate after the same manner 
the causes thereof 
with the manner of the fight in our severall faculties and parts
question 
what is the subject of this conflict 
in whom it is fought
a 
the subject of this combate are such persons as are regenerate 
and the faithfull only 
that be of age and discretion 
whilst they live 
for in them only is the cause of this conflict 
which is the cohabitation of these enemies which assault and resist one another 
1 
they that are perfectly sanctified feel no strife 
as there can be no such combate in the glorified saints 
because they are perfectly cleansed from sinne 
and have no reliques of the flesh 
or sinfull corruption remaining in them 
nor in adam in the state of innocency being perfectly holy 
if it be objected that there was a conflict in our saviour 
who was perfectly holy 
when in his agony he prayed to have the cup pass from him 
the answer is 
that this was not the conflict between the flesh and the spirit 
but the fight of two desires in different respects 
and both just 
or it was the combate between the superiour and inferour will 
the will of reason 
and the sensitive appetite 
so a man by his sensitive appetite may desire to eat and drink 
and in his superiour will may desire rather to abstain 
that it may be conformable to gods revealed will 
and thus our saviour being man 
and in all things like unto 
sinne only excepted 
desired that the cup of his passion might pass from him in his inferour will or natural appetite 
which shunneth death and seeketh the preservation of it self 
but in his reasonable will 
considering the end why he came into the world 
which was by his death to glorifie god in perfecting the work of our redemption 
he over-ruled the natural appetite 
and did wholly submit himself to the will of his father 
neither is the sensual appetite sinfull and unlawfull 
when it is subjected to the reasonable 
as it was most perfectly in christ 
but when it goeth about 
of a subject to become a sovereign 
and to resist and over-rule that unto which it should yeeld obedience 
2 
this conflict is not at all in those who are unregenerate and unsanctified 
for in these one of the combatants
which is the sanctifying spirit of grace 
is wanting 
and they are ruled by the flesh under their chief commander satan 
whose kingdom is not divied in the carnal man 
but he quietly reigneth and possesseth all in peace 
neither is there in him any power of saving effectual opposition 
for he is not only sickeph

but starke dead in trespasses and sinnes their mind and understading is blind 
dark 
foolish 
their wisdom is earthly 
carnal 
and divelish 
standing in direct opposition against the wisdom of god 
their desires are corrupt 
according to the sinfull inclination of their froward will 
howbeit we are to know 
that there is even in the carnal man another fight or skirmish 
which having some seeming shew and similitude of the spiritual conflict 
is by worldly and civil men mistaken for it 
but these combats do much differ 
and how they are to be distinguished we shall see hereafter 
when we have spoken of the manner of this combate 
3 
this conflict between the flesh and the spirit is in all the regenerate 
who have received spiritual illumination 
and have the use of their reason and understanding 
being possessed of gods sanctifying graces 
not only in their habits 
but also in their acts and operations 
not in the faculties alonegal 
517 
but also in their functions and exercises 
this is proved by the testimonies of scripture 
and common experience of all men regenerate 
neither is it possible that this mortal combate should be fought in any 
but that they must easily feel the terrible encounters and cruel blowes given on either side 
not between divers faculties 
as the conscience and the will 
the mind and judgment against the affections and several fculties 
but the self-same faculties 
as they are regenerate 
fighting against themselves as they are unregenerate 
as error against truth 
and truth against error in the same mind and understanding 
faith against doubting 
and doubting against faith in the same heart 
willing against nilling 
and nilling against willing 
about the choosing and refusing of good and evil in the same will 
the love of god conflicting and combating with the love of the world 
the fear of god with the fear of men 
all which doth plainly prove that their whole man is divided 
and part-takings in all their faculties and powers of body and mind 
the one adhering and cleaving to god 
the other drawing to satan and the world 
the which is more feelingly discerned 
and experimentally felt by every true christian 
then it can be demonstrated and evidenced by any mans writing 
finally 
the contrary effects which every christian may observe in himself do sufficiently argue and demonstrate that there are contrary causes in him from which they proceed 
for who findeth not 
after his regeneration and conversion 
himself to be a kingdom divided 
and that as in his spiritual and renewed part 
he hath a great desire to serve his lord and redeemer 
so in his fleshly part 
he is inclinable unto the service of sinne and satan for the base hire of worldly vanities 
and from this contrariety in affection and disposition 
the christian may discern the like contrariety in all his actions 
which arise and spring from them 
for one while the spirit lifteth him aloft in heavenly meditations 
and another while the flesh pulleth down his thoughts 
and fixeth them upon earthly vanities 
now with posting speed he runneth in the waies of god 
and sayleth with full sailes 
having the wind and tide to help him forward 
and soon after the flesh diverteth him into the by-paths of sinne 
or maketh him sit still 
or to return unto his old courses 
these things sufficiently manifest to every sanctified man 
that the flesh and spirit do continually war one against another 
and howsoever our chief commander may sometime sound a retreait 
and give us some intermissions for the renewing of our forces and recovery of our breath 
yet utter dismissions we shall not have from this warlike service 
till having overcome all our enemies by death 
we shall receive the crown of glory

get thee behind me satan 
for thou savorest not the things that be of god 
but those that be of men 
and who seeth not that the heart of the poor man was divided 
when he cryeth out 
i believe lord 
but addeth presently 
help mine unbelief 
at one and the same time 
he who did not yet perfectly believe 
did both believe 
and was incredulous 
and alwaies in the warfare of this present life 
the will is distracted betwixt good and evil 
striving in the part ascending with the part falling 
the sale now hanging on this side 
now on that 
that we must necessarily understand it to be divided in it self 
whose effect is so divided 
and yet we cannot inferre that the regenerate do serve god and the divel 
for with the heart they properly serve god 
and yet the will hath something of its own 
whereby it comes to pass that it cannot serve god perfectly 
and by accident some thing comes between now and then which is not of god 
which happens by humane frailty in them whom the wicked cannot touch
q 
the flesh and the spirit are contrary 
how then can they consist in the same subject
a 
it is impossible that contraries should stand together in the highest degrees 
because they mutually expell one another 
so it is impossible that the flesh and the spirit should both reign in the same man 
for as grace entreth 
corruption is expelled 
but in remiss degrees 
contraries may consist together 
though not without strife 
so the flesh and the spirit do dwell together in the regenerate 
as under one roof 
in remiss degrees 
but not without combate 
in which one while this 
another while that doth prevail or give place
q 
what is this conflict
a 
it is a continuall conflict between the unregenerate part of the flesh 
with the lusts thereof 
and the part regenerate 
the spirit with all the holy qualities 
graces and motions thereof 
by reason of their contrariety in nature and conjunction in place 
whereby they mutually lust and strive one against another 
the flesh willing and embracing that evil which the spirit nilleth and hateth 
and nilling and shunning that good which it willeth and effecteth 
and contrariwise 
for in this conflict they mutually assault one another with unreconcilable enmity and unplaable contrariety 
so that as the one getteth 
the other loseth 
as the one gathereth strength 
the other is weakned 
and look how much this prevaileth and triumpheth 
so much his enemy and opposite is foyled and dejected 
like herein to a pair of scales 
in which the rising of the one is alwaies joyned with the going down of the other 
or like the spleen in the body 
the swelling whereof is joyned with the others consumption
q 
is this combate in all the regenerate after the same manner
a 
this conflict between the flesh and the spirit is not in all the faithfull after the same manner 
nor in the same measure 
but diversly as it pleaseth the lord to glorifie himself in the manifestation of his wisdom 
goodness 
and omnipotency 
either by giving unto his servants a great measure of strength and spiritual grace by which they obtain an easie victory 
wherein the bounty of his goodness clearly shineth 
or a less or scanter proportion 
by which nowithstanding they are enabled as certainly 
though not so speedily to overcome 
hereby magnifying the all-sufficiency of his power 
which more manifestly appeares in our greatest weakness2 cor 
129 
for according as the measure of our spiritual strength and riches of gods grace 
as also of carnal corruption differ in
respect of their divers proportions 
such is the difference of this christian combate between one faithfull man and another 
some receive but a small measure of spiritual grace 
and these through their weakness 
commonly make warre against the assaults and encounters of the flesh but weakly 
though the lord performing to them his gracious promise 
will not suffer them to be tempted above their strength 
sometimes there is in the regenerate less reformation of their corrupt natures 
by the restraining grace of god and the common gifts of the spirit 
by reason whereof the flesh is of greater strength 
and the corruptions thereof are much more malignant 
so that though they have a great measure of strength and spiritual grace 
yet they cannot with any ease 
or in short time get the upper-hand 
but there is much strugling and wrestling 
sharp and fierce assaults on both sides 
finally 
the lord to shew the riches of his bounty 
doth somtimes give unto his servants such a large measure of grace 
spiritual strength 
knowledge 
faith 
love 
christian magnanimity and the rest 
that none of their spiritual enemies are able to withstand them 
but in the first encounters after this strength received 
they foyl 
wound 
and vanquish them 
either leading them captive without any great resistance 
or else putting them to a shamefull flight 
but this christian champion doth not thus prevail by vertue of any natural strength 
but through the gifts of the spirit
q 
what are the causes of this conflict
a 
1 
the remote cause is the will of god appointing this fight 
and to this purpose 
not perfecting our sanctification in this life 
but in part regenerating 
and in part leaving us unregenerate 
of this counsell of god divers reasons may be yeelded 
1 
it is profitable for the setting forth of his glory 
it doth most manifest and magnifie the glory of gods power 
for the weaker we are in our regenerate part 
the more clearly his power and wisdom shineth 
which so strengtheneth this weak part 
that it is able to stand in the day of battell 
and in the end obtaineth a full and perfect victory 
again 
god is glorified 
when we are moved hereby to attribute the whole glory and praise of our salvation to the alone mercy of god2 cor 
129 
both in respect of the beginning and perfecting thereof 
moreover 
the wisdom and power of god is more manifested and glorified 
when he doth his great works by contrary means and causes 
which in their own nature would rather hinder them 
as to preserve his graces by temptations 
lastly 
we are hereby made more thankfull unto the lord 
and more cheerfull in singing to his praise 
for the more sensible we are of gods benefits 
the better we esteem them 
and consequently receive them with greater thankfulness 
but the more we have found the want of them 
the more sensibly do we apprehend their excellency when we enjoy them 
our restoring out of a state of imperfection unto perfection 
is much more acceptable 
then if we had alwaies been preserved in itrom 
724 
25 
even as it gives us more contentment 
having been poor to be made 
then to be born rich 
the more free our graces received do appear unto us 
the more are we affected with them 
but our growth in sanctification is manifested to be the free gift of grace by the opposition of the flesh 
2 
it is profitable for our good 
and the furthering of our happiness 
it is effectual to make us deny our selves 
and a notable means to train us up in humility 
which is a grace most acceptable unto god 
and to subdue our pride 
and all vain-glorious conceit 
which above all vices is most odious and hatefull 
we are hereby moved to abhorue sinne 
which god hateth 
with greater detestation 
when as by our own experience we find the venom and poyson of it working in our selves 
and to bewaile and forsake it with more earnest endeavour 
when we discerne and see what miserable effects it produceth 
and what bitter and cursed fruits it bringeth forth in us 
by the sight and sense of these sinfull corruptions still dwelling in us 
we are occasioned to fly oftner unto god by fervant prayers 
acknowledging and bewailing them before the
throne of grace 
earnestly craving the remission of them 
and the assistance of gods grace and holy spirit 
whereby we may be enabled to mortifie our corruptions 
and to fly all sinne for the time to come 
we have also through these corruptions dwelling in us 
the benefit of spiritual exercise 
whilst we make warre against them 
withstand their assaults 
prepare our selves for the conflict 
watch over our own hearts that we be not surprized at unawares 
mortifie and subdue them with the sword of the spirit 
exercise the spiritual graces received from god 
and our selves in all holy duties which god requireth for the obtaining of victory 
it may serve to make us go on in our pilgrimage with contentment 
and to bear all afflictions which are laid upon us with meekness and patience 
not only because we have deserved them by sinne 
but also because we know and have experience that these corrections are necessary to bridle and mortifie the flesh with the lusts thereof 
and serve as drawing salves to draw out the coar of our corruptions 
it is also profitable for the weaning of our hearts and affections from the world 
and to make us long after our heavenly happiness 
when as we find our selves tired and wearied in fighting 
not onely with forreign foes 
but with these secret intestine in our own bowels 
the crown of glory and eternal rest will be the more welcome 
and the graces of the spirit the more glorious 
as our conflicts in this life are the more sharp and difficult2 tim 
48 
the shade is comfortable to the weary traveller 
the guord pleased jonah well 
when the sunne beat upon him that he was ready to faint 
3 
it is suitable and seasonable to the time and place wherein we live 
that these reliques of sin should remain in us 
for it is appointed by god that we should not in this life attain unto perfection 
but that we should only labour after it and attain unto it in the life to come 
the immediate formall cause of this combate is two-foldgal 
517 
the one is the contrariety which is between the flesh and the spirit 
which is exceeding hostile 
and full of all enmity and opposition 
for in nature they are directly oppsite 
as heat and cold 
light and darkness 
health and sickness 
what is the spirit infused into us 
but the quality of holiness and righteousness renewed according to gods image 
what is the flesh 
but the defaceing of this image 
the deprivation of this original righteousness 
and the stain of natural corruption which hath overspred and defiled all the powers and parts of our souls and bodies 
the other is their cohabitation and dwelling together in the same place and subject 
the same room and faculty 
which ministreth unto them 
mutually occasion 
and imposeth a necessity of their continuall opposition 
even as when fire and water 
heat and cold meet together
q 
what is the manner of this fight
a 
as the enemies are spiritual 
so is the manner of the fight spiritual 
by inward lusting and concupiscence 
whereby motions and inclinations 
either good or evil are stirred up in the soul and heartgal 
517 
and thus there is a contrary lusting between the flesh and the spirit 
the one lusting against the other 
in which their contrary lusting 
they both of them mainly aime at two general ends 
the first aim of the flesh 
is to stirre up and incline us unto such lusts 
desires and motions as are sinfull and contrary to the law of god 
as to infidelity 
impenitency 
pride 
self-love 
hatred 
envy 
uncleanness 
covetousness and such like 
or to speak more distinctly 
it endeavoureth to beget and stirre up 
preserve and nourish evil cogitations in the mind 
wicked inclinations in the will 
and sinfull affections and desires in the heart 
in which respect it is fitly compared to a fiery furnace or boyling pothos 
74 
iam 
114 
15 
which continually sendeth up sparks and smoak 
and by the apostle james it is likened to a filthy harlot 
which by her alluring baits inticeth to commit folly with her 
upon which followeth the conception and birth of sinne 
causing death 
and our saviour christ telleth us 
that from within 
even in the heart 
that is 
the sinfull flesh and natural
corruption which resideth in the heart 
proceed evil thoughts 
adulteries 
fornicationsmat 
1518 
19 murthers 
thefts 
covetousness 
wickedness 
deceit 
laciviousness

plasphemy 
pride 
foolishness 
the second action or aim of the flesh is 
either to repress and smother the good motions and inclinations which the spirit exciteth and stirreth up in us 
or else to poison and corrupt them 
that they may become unprofitable and turned into sinne 
so when the spirit moveth us to perform some good duty of gods service 
of justice or mercy 
it will labour to quench this motion 
and to withdraw us from it 
either by alluring us utterly to neglect it 
or to spend our time rather in pursuing worldly vanities 
or by perswading us 
that there is such difficulty in it 
that we shall not be possibly able to compass or atchieve it 
that it is very irkesome and unpleasant 
or unprofitable and not worth our labour 
that the loss we shall sustain by it is present 
the gain uncertain 
but if it cannot wholly pervert 
then it inticeth us to use delaies 
because we may be fitter or have better opportunity to perform it hereafter 
then at this present 
it also hangeth dulness and sloth upon us 
that we are loath to stirre about the work of god 
or at least undertake it as men do things by half-chare 
unto which they bear no hearty affection 
finally 
it endeavoureth to interrupt or distract us in them 
and to stain them with our imperfections and corruptions 
that they may not be acceptable 
as when we set our selves to pray or hear the word 
it will put into our minds worldly cogitations and wandering thoughts 
that so we may not attend those holy exercises 
or else oppress our hearts with drowsie dulness 
deadness of spirit and carnal weariness 
so as we cannot perform them with any cheerfulness 
the spirit aimeth at a two-fold end also 
first 
it endeavoureth to stirre up and preserve good motions and inclinations in us 
as good meditations in the mind 
good resolutions in the will 
good desires and affections in the heart 
which are conformable and agreeable to the holy will and word of god 
thus the apostle saith1 joh 
220 
that we have received an unction from the holy one whereby we know all things 
and st paul exhorteth us not to quench the spirit 
that is 
the good motions which arise from it1 thes 
519 
psal 
167 
as it were sparks from the fire 
so david 
i will bless the lord who hath given me counsell 
my reines also instruct me in the night season 
that is 
those sweet meditations and motions which the spirit secretly in the night season putteth into our minds and heartsesa 
3021 
and the prophet esay saith 
that the ears of the faithfull shall hear a voice behind them 
saying 
this is the way walk ye in it 
when they turned to the right hand 
and when they turned to the left 
which is to be understood not only of the voice of gods ministers outwardly speaking unto us in the ministery of the word 
but also of the voice of the spirit secretly by the good motions thereof leading us into all truth 
for so our saviour promiseth accordinglyioh 
168 
13 
that he would send his spirit the comforter 
who should convince the world of sinne 
righteousness and judgment 
and that when he was come 
he should lead the faithfull into all truth 
and reveale unto them things to come 
the second action of the spirit is 
to labour and endeavour the suppression and subduing those evil motions which the flesh raiseth in us 
and still moveth us to take the first and best opportunity of serving god and doing his will 
so also it purifieth the heart by faith from all our sinfull corruptions 
and maketh us to labour and strive against our infirmities and imperfections 
that we may with fervency of spirit and cheerfulness of heart perform all holy duties and service unto god 
and when in these endeavours we come short of our desires 
through this sinfull flesh which doth so easily compass us 
it moveth us to bewaile our imperfections 
and still more and more to labour in the use of all good means 
whereby we may attain unto more perfection 
as we see in the example of the apostle paul 
who kept under this body of corruption 
beating it2 cor 
927 
as it were 
black and blew 
that he might hold it with the lusts thereof in subjection 
whereof when he failed 
and was either hindred from doing
good 
or led captive unto sinne 
he makes lamentable complaints of these rebellious lusts 
and not contenting himself with that portion of grace and godliness unto which he had attained 
he forgat what was past 
and still did labour and strive to attain unto more perfection and thus the spirit mastereth and subdueth the flesh 
so as it cannot have full liberty 
and take its full swing in sinne 
as it desireth 
according to that of the apostle1 joh 
39 
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sinne 
for his seed remaineth in him 
that is 
grace wrought in the heart by the holy ghost 
which resisteth the rebellious desires of the flesh 
and he cannot sin 
namely like the unregenerate with full swing and consent of will 
because he is born of god
q 
let us consider the manner of this fight between the flesh and the spirit in our severall faculties and parts
a 
1 
the understanding being in part regenerate and sanctified 
and in part unregenerate and corrupt 
partly enlightned with spiritual 
sound and saving knowledge 
and partly obscured with the reliques of ignorance 
and not onely so 
but also much defiled and depraved with curiosity 
dulness 
negligence 
presumption or conceit of knowledge 
there is a continuall combate maintained in it 
between sound knowledge on the one side 
and palpable ignorance 
gross dulness 
vain presumption which make resistance 
in the mind there is a conflict between the knowledge of the truth and natural blindness or ignorance 
for seeing in this life we know but in part1 cor 
1312 
therefore knowledge of the truth must needs be joyned with ignorance in all that are enlightned 
and one of them being contrary to another 
they strive to over-shadow and over-cast each other 
and this is the cause of this conflict 
whilst ignorance striving to keep its place in the understanding 
raiseth thick mists and dark fogs to obscure the light of truth 
and to put out or dazle the eyes of the mind 
and on the other side saving knowledg doth endeavour with the sun-shine of truth shining clearly in gods word 
to dispell and scatter these misty fogs by little and little 
untill it shine forth brightly unto perfect day 
again 
carnal curiosity neglecting those things that are profitable 
necessary 
and revealed to be known of us 
laboureth after nice and idle speculations and curious questions 
which as they are useless and vain 
so also abstruse and secret 
or else diveth into gods hidden counsels which he hath forbidden us to search and prie into 
but saving knowledge not only leaveth secret things as belonging to the lord our goddeut 
2929 
but also represseth and mortifieth our curiosity as much as may be 
and restraining us from going about to understand above that which is meet 
it understandeth in sobriety 
according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faithrom 
123 
it apprehendeth things revealed as belonging unto us 
and aimeth more at the use and fruit in practice 
then in the theory and speculation 
and to have feeling and experience of a little 
rather then a bare conceipt and ability to discourse of much 
and yet it resteth not in a small measure 
yea in truth not in the greatest proportion 
but still laboureth after spiritual growth 
and encrease daily more and more untill it come to perfection in jesus christ 
but as the mind enlightned is quick to apprehend 
and carefull to encrease in the knowledge of spiritual things 
so it is unapt to conceive 
and sluggish to search after the understanding of heavenly misteries 
our sight is dimme and old 
to which great things appear small 
and small things none at all 
our best endeavoures after the knowledge of gods word 
are not unfitly resembled to the motions of a man sick of a fever 
whose labour is mixt with much sloth and feebleness 
by nature we are not more blind then self-conceited 
knowing nothing 
and yet vainly puffed up as if we understood all things 
which poison is partly abated 
not utterly expelled by the power of grace 
so that in the renewed mind 
there is a continuall conflict between the conceit of knowledge and soundness of truth 
these two both residing in the same power of the soul 
and yet being directly opposite the
one to the other 
emptiness breedeth a desire of encrease 
conceit of fulness cloyeth the appetite 
thus it fareth with the most holy in this life 
though not with all men in the same measure and degree 
from whence these conclusions follow 
1 
all christians endued with the saving and sanctifying spirit of god are illightned soundly 
distnctly 
certainly to understand the things that be of godprov 
302 
but the most holy are ignorant of many things 
know nothing for measure 
clearness 
and certainty as they ought to do 
2 
the assent that is given to the truth of god is imperfect 
mixed with much doubting 
as the man in the gospel saithmar 
924 
lord 
i believe 
help my unbelief 
the righteous do firmely give credit to the scriptures 
as the undoubted 
infallible word of life 
and rule of religion 
but this belief is not grown to perfect strength 
nor freed from assaults of unbelief 
3 
the righteous are in part acquainted with their natural blindness and corruption 
but their darkness and corruption is far deeper then they can prie into 
every man is ignorant of much more then he knoweth by himself 
and guilty of more sinnes then he can discerne in himself 
4 
the godly man desires to encrease in knowledge of things profitable 
but through infirmity he is prone to seek to know much 
rather than what is behovefull 
and tends to the furtherance of his salvation 
5 
the church of god was never so happy 
that all godly and religious learned divines should be of one mind in all points of religion 
the reason of it is 
because natural blindness yet remaining 
prevails more or less 
men that are dim-sighted and cannot discerne without spectacles 
if they be set to discry a thing a farre off 
the most of them would be of divers opinions of it 
the reliques of ignorance still possessing the mind of the regenerate 
is the cause why they know but in part 
and see the truth of god through a glass darkly 
the which imperfection of their spiritual sight and knowledg 
worketh in them only a probable opinion in some things 
and not a well-setled 
resolved judgment 
which maketh them to take that way which their conceipt apprehendeth as the most likely 
like divers men intending to travell towards the same city 
who being uncertain and doubtfull of the direct way in every point and turning 
do in that particular choose divers paths 
all leading to the same place 
though some more direct 
others much about 
6 
these contrary qualities do fight continually one with another 
and interchangeably both prevaile sometimes 
and sometimes are again foiled and get the worst 
as for example 
knowledge in the regenerate part of the mind 
assaulteth ignorance that is mixed with it 
and with the light of gods truth 
scattereth and dispelleth the dark mists of ignorance 
and soon after 
ignorance through the neglect of reading 
meditation 
hearing the word 
prayer and holy conferences gathereth strength 
and bleareth again the eyes of the understanding 
that it cannot so clearly at least after a saving 
feeling 
and experimentall manner discerne the things of god 
and when ignorance prevailes 
men otherwise godly and religious 
may leave the way of truth and fall into errours 
after their understandings have been truly enlightned 
the flesh dazling the eyes of their mind 
whilst with its mists and fogs it darkneth the light which formerly did shine unto them 
the which befalleth them sometimes 
not only in the knowledge of those points of religion which are of less consequence 
but also exceeding weighty and fundamentall 
as we see in the example of the corintheans and the galathians 
even after the truth of the gospel had been preached unto them 
and as one man may erre 
so may an hundred 
yea 
a whole particular church 
for in respect of this combate 
the estate and condition of all men is alike 
that which is the state of every man 
is the case of all 
the same reason being of the whole and all the parts 
whence it appears 
that the church militant upon earth is subject to errour 
but yet as the diseases of the body be of two sorts 
some curable 
and some incurable which are to death 
so likewise errours are 
and the church though it be subject
to sundry fals 
yet it cannot erre in foundation to death 
the errours of gods children be curable 
some may here say 
if all men and churches be subject to errour 
then it shall not be good to joyn with any of them 
but to separate from them all 
i answer 
though they may and do erre 
yet we must not separate from them 
so long as they do not separate from christ 
though the visible church offend 
yet may we not forsake her untill christ sue a bill of divorce against heran pudebit eos illic dis cumbere 
ubi vident christum non pudere 
au illo sactiores &amp 
mndiores erant

apoc 320 
we need not fear infection amongst them by communion and society 
that sup with christ and enjoy his presence in his holy ordinances 
but seeing through the flesh remaining in us 
we are subject to ignorance and errour 
this should make us to conform our opinion to the analogy of faith 
and as to hold fast those doctrines which are manifestly grounded upon the scriptures 
so to be modest and sober in maintaining such points as are doubtfull and controversall 
when as other of our brethren differ from us 
because we may erre by reason of these reliques of ignorance abiding in us 
and they may erre also out of humane frailty 
finally 
seeing the reliques of ignorance and error will never leave us till death divide us 
this must make us labour continually in the use of all good means 
whereby our minds may be more and more illightned 
and especially we are to hear the word 
study and meditate in the scriptures 
and call often and earnestly by fervant prayers for the assistance and illumination of gods holy spirit 
whereby we may be preserved from errour 
and led into all truth 
for if david who was wiser then his ancients 
had need to make that prayer 
open mine eyes 
o lord 
that i may see the wonders of thy lawpsal 
11918 
and if the apostle paul who was immediately taught by christ 
desired above all things still more and more to know christ 
then how much more should wephil 
310 
who come farre short of their perfection 
again 
constant 
clear and firm assent to the word of truth is opposite to unbelief 
and is opposed by it 
these two contraries do warre continually in the soul 
and sometimes the worst part doth get the upper-hand 
in which temptation the godly have greatly staggered at the truth of gods promises 
and questioned what the lord hath spoken 
david confesseth of himself 
i said in my haste all men are lyarspsal 
11611 
psal 
779

the disciples hear from christ 
o fools and slow of heart 
to believe those things that are spoken by the prophets 
zachary is striken dumb 
because he believed not what was spoken unto him by the angel of the lord 
abraham is much commended in scripture for his constant belief in the promises of grace 
but many tokens of unbelief are noted in him 
thus we see that the assent which men give to the words of truth 
is often shaken through the infirmity of the flesh 
moreover 
sound knowledge is assaulted with vain curiosity and conceit of self-sufficiency 
which so prevailes in the godly now and then 
that neglecting the search of things necessary 
sound and comfortable 
they give themselves to vain and idle speculations 
matters of doubtfull disputation 
distracting controversies 
genealogies and such like 
the apostles exhortation is not causeless 
give not heed to jewish fables1 tim

but speak the things which become sound doctrine 
the disciples are more forward to enquire 
whether the blind man or his father had sinned 
than to be informed what use they should make of that visitation 
to be resolved of the number of them that should be saved 
than to strive to make their calling and election sure 
this is an hereditary disease which we derived from our first parents 
and in some measure more or less doth hang upon all the sonnes of god 
so long as they carry about with them this body of sinne 
lastly 
sound and sanctified knowledge doth encounter that spirituall laziness and deceit of minde 
whereby we are apt to rest in the superficiall and sleight apprehension of truth 
not possessing the fruit and comfort of it 
but this deceit prevails with us many times to the great prejudice of our spirituall welfare 
many times good christians forgetting themselves 
and giving place to sloth and security 
do rest in this 
that
they hear the word 
pray 
can repeat what they have heard 
be able to confer of matters of religion 
but labour not to be well-grounded in the true religion 
to possess the word as their own 
and to be throughly changed into the nature of it 
2 
the faculty of thinking 
studying 
devising 
is partly renewed by grace 
partly corrupted by the flesh 
partly spirituall 
and partly carnall 
from which cohabitation of grace and corruption 
followeth a continuall strife and fight of thoughts and cogitations 
imaginations and motions 
devices 
meditations and purposes 
which labour mutually to expell one another 
and to keep the minde in their sole possession 
for when the spirit lifteth up the minde in divine contemplation 
and causeth it to think and meditate on heavenly things as the end of our hopes 
or on the service of god 
the duties of christianity 
or of our lawfull callings 
as the means whereby we may attain unto them 
then the flesh depresseth and pulleth it down 
and by suggesting such thoughts as be simply worldly and wicked 
or at least impertinent 
vain and unseasonable in respect of present imployment 
do cause it to stoop unto earthly vanity 
but the spirit finding it self thus defeated of those spirituall excellencies 
which so earnestly it desireth 
doth not rest thus dejected and depressed 
but shaking off the thoughts of sinfull vanities and sensuall delights 
it leaveth the earth and up again it mounteth in spirituall and heavenly thoughts 
in respect of this combate it fareth thus with the spirituall manphil 
320 
col 31 
first 
he doth earnestly and with intention minde the things that are above 
devise honest things 
and bend his thoughts to that which is most excellent 
but he is so clogged with the flesh that he cannot sore aloft 
nor walk with god in heavenly contemplation 
as he desireth 
secondly 
it is his chief delight to commune with the lord in secret 
and in all his thoughts to acknowledge him 
but by reason of the flesh he finds it tedious and irksome to keep his heart attentively to things above 
as labour is wearisome to them that love idleness 
follow liberty 
thirdly 
the thought of evil is distastfull 
odious 
and yet he feels wicked motions issuing continually from the stinking puddle of original corruption 
which he cannot dry up 
fourthly 
the main study and set resolution of the godly man is to pursue that which is approved in the sight of god 
but the flesh interrupteth these holy determinations 
and suggesteth many devices of sinne 
which oft times finde too great harbour in the soul 
what good soul is not pestered with thoughts of pride 
covetousness 
vanity 
voluptuousness 
devices of revenge 
cosenage 
fraud 
revenge 
injustice 
and how to lessen or excuse sinne 
3 
the faculty of judging is in part renewed by grace to discern the things that differ 
and to approve the things that are excellent 
but in part remains corrupt with errour 
vanity and folly 
from which ariseth a conflict between the judgement of the flesh and of the spirit 
for so farre forth as the minde is enlightened to discern between truth and falshood 
right and wrong 
good and evil 
it doth allow and approve 
esteem and prize the one simply and in comparison 
and disallow 
reject and vilifie the other 
but so farre forth as it still remaineth erroneous 
vain and foolish 
it mistaketh errour for truth 
wrong for rightpsal 
7313 
15 and evil for good 
so david himself being ignorant of the state of the godly and wicked in this life in respect of prosperity and adversity 
and that these things happen alike to all 
was ready by a false judgement to condemn the generation of gods children 
but that after going into the sanctuary his mind was enlightened with the knowledge of the truth 
and his judgement gave right evidenceact 
1014 
34 
35 
and the apostle peter being ignorant of the abrogating of the cermonial law after the death of christ 
and of the breaking down of the partition wall between the jews and gentiles 
judgeth the creatures of god unclean which he had sanctified 
and that he was so confined within the land of jury 
that he might not preach unto the gentiles 
but when god by vision had inlightened his minde with the knowledge of the truth 
he reformed also the errour
of his judgement 
the case standing thus with the man regeneate 
it followeth 
first 
that a man renewed by grace doth truly judg his state by nature to be miserable and vile 
sinne to be abhominable and filthy 
but he cannot sufficiently discover the depth of his misery 
or the multitude and hainousness of his transgressions 
the best men sinne many times when they know it not 
and every mans sinne is greater than he doth account it 
secondly 
a sanctified heart doth highly prize the favour of god 
and the joys of heaven 
as farre to be preferred above the pleasures of sinne 
and all transitory vanities of this life 
but his capacity is too shallow to comprehend the worth of heavenly things in their due measure 
the things of god are infinitely more excellent than our esteem of them 
thirdly 
the spirit of god opening the eyes of a man regenerate to see and discern the incomprehensible value of spiritual things 
he doth resolve to seek after them 
though it be with the loss of all earthly contentments 
and to persist immoveably in the pursuit of them 
notwithstanding all occurrences which might divert or turn him aside 
but when the judgment of the flesh prevaileth 
a good man may preferre the less good before the greater 
and disallow that in comparison which he esteemed in it self considered 
thus peter denied his master to save his life 
and he that in a general and constant determination hath chosen god for his portion 
in some particular acts may approve vanity rather than affliction 
fourthly 
by reason of this mixture of grace and corruption in the faculty of discerning 
the most wise and judicious do often erre 
taking evil for good 
and good for evil 
wrong for right 
and right for wrong 
and hereby we easily perceive that the wisdom of the world which is earthly 
sensuall 
and divelish 
doth abide in the heart renewed with spiritual wisdom from above 
which two mutually oppose each other with might and main 
for the one is wholly taken up and exercised in spiritual and heavenly things 
which it seeth 
knoweth 
and esteemeth as most excellent 
and doth contemn worldly vanities as dross and dung 
yea 
loss in comparison of them 
but the other is wholly devoted to earthly things and transitory trifles 
looketh only downward 
and not able to discerne the glorious beauty of those divine excellencies 
it is only delighted in beholding those things whose beauty is subject to the senses and natural reason 
about which it is continually exercised 
peter may be an example for this matter 
in whom we may see our own faces 
for in that notable confession of faith in christ 
which he made in the name of all the disciples 
he shewed that in his mind he savoured the things of godmat 
1616 
mat 
1623 
who a little after is reprehended by our saviour for his carnal counsel 
as not savouring the things of god 
and thus it standeth with christians in this world 
whiles the wisdom of the spirit doth exercise her sovereignty 
and is preserved 
nourished 
and kept 
they are wise to do good 
couragious for the truth 
forward in the practice of piety and godliness 
but when carnal wisdom getteth the start 
and dimmeth the sight of sound judgment with the mists of errour 
shews of vanities 
and policies of the flesh 
then they take counsel and follow courses prejudiciall to their peace and safety 
4 
the reliques of corruption still remain in the renewed faculty of remembring 
which causeth a continuall sight in that power of the soul 
for the memory so farre as it is spiritual 
laboureth to blot out and deface all worldly 
wicked and sinfull impressions 
and to have imprinted in it 
those heavenly and spiritual documents and instructions which have been entrusted unto it by the sanctified understanding 
that it might call them to mind seasonably and with due effect 
contrariwise the flesh and unregenerate part standeth in direct opposition to the spirit 
labouring to reprint and repeate those lessons of impiety and prophaneness which before our conversion especially 
and since also we have learned in the school of the divel and of the world 
and to work in us oblivion and forgetfulness of all good things 
whereby those heavenly treasures and spiritual jewels are presently cast out of doors 
as soon
as they are received 
or if the understanding of them be kept in the brain for discourse 
their vigour is lost in the heart 
the aim of the spirit is to treasure up and hide the word of god in the heart 
that it might effectually and with fruit be recalled as occasion requireth 
the action of the flesh is to race out all remembrance of what is truly good and acceptable 
by causing utter forgetfulness of what hath been taught or done 
or besotting men to rest in the bare 
fruitless 
dead repetition of it without life or power 
for that is forgotten 
which affecteth not according to the nature and quality of the thing 
again 
the spirit endeavoureth to cast out the rubbish of impiety 
prophaness 
scurrility 
filthiness 
ribaldry 
malitiousness 
that it might never be remembred without hatred or detestation 
but the flesh solliciteth to the delightfull remembrance of wickedness past 
that by the pleasure of it the soul might be defiled 
thus it standeth with the regenerate 
first 
he doth truly and effectually remember the things that concern his peace 
and the glory of god 
but is not able to recall them when occasion is offered 
as he ought 
secondly 
he doth look back upon sinnes past with grief and hatred 
but cannot at all times detest the thought of them 
never loath their remembrance in that measure as is fit 
thirdly 
when the flesh prevails through the laziness 
security 
and infirmity of the faithfull 
then they stain themselves with the delightfull remembrance of evil 
or the slight remembrance of what is seriously to be minded 
5 
the faculty of willing and nilling 
choosing 
refusing 
and prosecuting 
is in part renewed 
and in part remains corrupt 
which two contrary factions war together without ceasing 
for the regenerate part willeth and enforceth that which is good 
and nilleth and rejecteth all evil 
but the part unregenerate willeth and chooseth that which is evil in it self 
or at least some inferiour good in place of the chief 
and nilleth and refuseth that which is truly 
absolutely 
universally good 
as for example 
the spiritual part being guided by the understanding 
enlightned with saving knowledge 
chooseth and embraceth god as the chief good 
his kingdom and righteousness as the chief happiness 
and refuseth and contemneth the world and earthly vanities 
the service of satan 
and the momentanie pleasures of sinne 
which in the end bring death and destruction 
though they for the present be bitter to the flesh 
and much more imbittered by afflictions 
and these be sweet and delightfull to the carnal appetite 
but contrariwise that part of the will which remaineth unregenerate 
being directed by that wisdom which is worldly 
sensul and divelish 
neglecteth and refuseth the present comforts of grace which it relisheth not 
and the future hopes of heavenly happiness which it knoweth not 
as being out of sight and beyond the apprehension of sense 
uncertain 
and not to be compassed without great difficulty 
and it chooseth and embraceth this present world with the vain honours 
uncertain riches 
and sinfull pleasures of it 
because they are subject to the senses and may be had in present possession 
first 
a man sanctified by the spirit 
is enabled to will and choose that which is spiritually good 
in truth 
order 
and sincerity 
but he cannot will it in perfection and measure as he ought 
according as the goodness of the thing deserves 
secondly 
he doth truly nill all evil 
and refuse 
contemn 
and tread under-feet the base vanities of this world 
which sollicite to draw the heart from god 
but he cannot turn from evil 
nor despise vanity in that exactness the word requireth 
thirdly 
as the will of the regenerate is corrupt in part 
so are the motions 
wishes and desires which arise from it 
which ordinarily are mastered by grace 
but now and then prevail against the spirit and get ground of it 
from this combate in the intellectual nature springeth another betwixt faith and the contrary extreams 
infidelity and presumption 
which continually assault one another 
sometimes the one 
sometimes the other getting the better in the particular skirmish 
although in conclusion and end of the fight 
faith alwaies overcometh
and obtaineth a full and final victory 
in the mean time 
even after that by faith we have laid hold on the promises 
and have grown to a great measure of strength and to an high degree of perswasion 
doubting and infidelity 
taking the opportunity of some grievous temptation 
do give unto our faith many wounds and foilsheb

7710 
of which notwithstanding it recovereth upon the renewing of our covenant with god 
contrariwise our faith is assaulted with presumption 
whereby the flesh moveth us falsly to apply the promises 
and to presume of gods love and our own salvation 
for though these do potentially belong to all the faithful 
yet they cannot actually be applied unto them 
so long as they live and lie securely in some known sins without repentance 
but against these also faith prevaileth 
when as it purifieth the heart 
bringeth to a sight and sense of sinne 
to a loathing and detestation of them 
with constant resolution and earnest endeavour to leave and forsake them 
thus the case stands in this particular 
first 
the strongest faith is imperfect 
and mixt with the contrary unbelief 
doubting 
presumption 
secondly 
faith is an uniform 
universall 
constant adherence to the whole truth of god in habite 
though the act be often interrupted thirdly 
by reason of this fight 
when unbelief prevailes 
the very child of god may fall into fits and pangs of despair 
yea 
this despair may be so extream 
that it shall weaken the body and consume it 
more than any sickness 
fourthly 
though the faithfull man be brought to despair of his election and salvation in christ 
yet his desparation is neither totall nor finall 
it is not totall 
because he doth not despair with his whole heart 
faith even at that instant lusting against despair 
it is not finall 
because he shall recover before the end of this life 
the affections are subordinate to the will 
in which the conflict is not more dangerous 
but more turbulent and violent 
poyson in the brain is as mortall and pernicious as any other 
but in the stomack much more raging and violent 
so the corruption of minde and will is no less perillous 
but that of the affections more sensible and grievous 
the hard stone in the heart striveth with the soft flesh 
rebellion with obedience 
corruption with grace 
and whilest the spirit draweth the heart unto god 
and spiritual and heavenly things 
that it may inseparably cleave and adhere unto them 
the flesh pulleth it back and with-draweth it from them 
and laboureth to keep it still fixed and fastned upon earthly and worldly vanities 
there is a coninuall conflict between the affections 
wherein the same affections divided 
as it were 
between grace and corruption do fight and strive against themselves 
and sometimes being cross matched 
do mutually oppose and encounter other affections and passions which are contrary and opposite unto them 
the former combate being exercised in contrary 
the latter about the same subjects 
thus the love of god 
and of spirituall and heavenly things is assaulted with self-love 
love of the world 
and hatred of those divine excellencies 
affiance in god 
his providence and promises 
with confidence in the creatures 
and diffidence in the all-sufficient creatour 
zeal of gods glory with carnall blind zeal 
coldness and lukewarmness 
the fear of god which is ingenuous and filiall 
with fear of men 
and fear of god which is slavish and servile 
hope in god 
with earthly hopes 
and also with presumption and despair 
sorrow for sinne 
with worldly sorrow which causeth death 
and also with wretchlesness and carnal security 
joy in the holy ghost and spiritual rejoycing in god 
with carnal joy in the pleasures of sinne 
and desperate grief for worldly losses 
alacrity and chearfulness in gods service 
with carnal chearfulness in pursuing our sensual and sinfull delights 
and also with lumpish heaviness 
dullness 
deadness of heart and carnall weariness 
in which conflict though the spirit receive many foyles through the raging violence of these wild heasts and rebellious passions 
and is oftentimes so wounded 
that in outward appearance there seemeth to be no life remaining 
yet it proveth to be but a dangerous swound 
out of which
recovering with redoubled valour 
it reneweth the combate and getteth the victory 
though it seem but a small spark remaining of a great fire 
almost extinguished with a flood of passions 
and so covered under the ashes of corruptions that it scarce appeareth 
yet when the spirit of god doth blow upon it 
it increaseth in strength to a great flame 
in respect of this mixture of grace and corruption in the whole soul and every faculty of it 
a man regenerate is like him that hath one legge sound 
the other lame 
who in every step which he makes doth not wholly halt or wholly go upright 
but partly halt 
and partly go upright 
at the same time he is inclined to contraries 
affecteth things that cannot stand together like a man in a boat on the water 
who goeth upward because he is carried upward by the vessel 
and at the same time goes downward 
because he walks downward in the same vessel at the same instant 
but when corruption getteth the better against grace 
there ariseth in the godly a certain deadness or hardness of heart 
of which they complain with great bitterness 
lastly 
if there be a combate in the whole soul 
it must needs take place in the renewed conscience 
which is the reflection of the soul upon it self 
for as it is regenerate it is so inlightned and rectified by the spirit of grace 
that like a true witness it giveth an infallible testimony between god and us 
excusing us when we do well 
that we may proceed in well-doing 
and accusing us when we have done evil 
that we may forsake it and recover our selves by unfained repentance 
yea before the doing of either of them both 
it giveth testimony and approbation unto that which is good 
that we may embrace and practise it 
and also discovereth that which is wickedf and sinfull 
that we may shunne and avoid it 
neither doth it only play the part o a witness 
but also of a judg 
and according to this true evidence 
it either justifieth us 
or pronounceth the sentence of condemnation against us 
from the former whereof ariseth peace 
joy and comfort 
whereby we are encouraged to proceed in all holy duties 
and from the other 
either fear whereby we are restrained from falling into sinne 
or sorrow and repentance not to be repented of 
causing salvation 
after that we have fallen 
but on the contrary 
as the conscience is unregenerate it remaineth blinded with ignorance 
and corrupted with benummedness 
superstition 
maliciousness 
and therefore is continually ready to play the part of a false witness 
either dawbing or colouring over our sinne with deceitfull colours 
that we may ignorantly fall into it 
or excusing it being committed 
as though it were light and trivial 
that we may continue in it without repentance 
or on the other side it is ready to accuse us when we do well 
and in the service of god 
or the use of christian liberty to raise in our minds superstitious fears and causeless doubts 
that so being afrighted we may be hindred from christian duties 
or discouraged after we have done them 
and so answerably it playeth the false judge 
condemning where god and a good conscience justifie 
and justifying where they condemn 
the which false sentence is the cause of carnal security when we continue in sin 
and of causeless terrrours and needless fears when we are carefull to perform our duty 
but the carnal conscience which lyeth asleep in security 
being once awakened filleth the soul with deep doubts 
grievous fears 
and horrible despair of mercy and forgiveness 
untill it be allayed and quieted by faith in the blood of jesus christ 
which is sufficient to purge it from all pollutions 
thus the conscience of the regenerate is in part lightsome 
pure 
peaceable and lively 
directing in holiness 
curbing from sinne 
witnessing their reconciliation with god 
testifying of their uprightness 
inciting and comforting them in weldoing 
but in part it is darksome 
impure 
superstitious 
scrupulous 
unquiet 
benummed 
and erroneous 
from which it followeth 
first 
that a christian can neither perfectly understand the multitude of his sinnes 
nor the measure of his grace exactly 
secondly 
his peace is mixed with unquietness 
and his assurance dimmely apprehended 
assaulted with doubtings 
thirdly
the godly are subject to be loose in many things where in they should be strict 
and to be scrupulous in some cases 
wherein they may take liberty 
to run too fast now and then 
and anon to grow slack and lazy 
fourthly 
when the flesh prevails they may fall into a great fit of security and benummedness 
out of which they are ordinarily awakened with fears and terrours

of the divers kindes of combate that be in unregenerate men 
and how they differ from that combate which is proper to the regenerate 
the issue 
or event of the spiritual combate 
the meanes to be used for the weakening of the flesh 
and strengthening of the spirit unto this combate 
the effect of the combate 
with the properties thereof
question 
is there no combate in unregenerate men
a 
there be divers kinds of combates 
first 
of divers desires in different respects 
or of the reasonable will and sensitive appetite in sundry considerations 
this may be found in good and bad 
innocent and corrupt in this life 
secondly 
of divers faculties 
as of the mind or conscience with the will 
reason with appetite leading to things evil 
vain or hurtfull 
this is to be found only in subjects corrupted with sinne 
but is common to the godly and ungodly 
thirdly 
of the remainders of gods image 
with the power of corruption in the same faculty 
mind or will 
this hath place in civil honest men 
who continue in their natural stock 
and be not changed by grace 
fourthly 
of the temporary graces of the spirit with the strength of corruption in some sort repressed 
but not mortified 
this is proper to them that be in part enlightned with the knowledge of the truth 
and are partakers of some common graces of the spirit 
though not such as accompany salvation 
fifthly 
of the flesh and the spirit 
this is peculiar to the saints in this life 
whose graces be true 
but imperfect 
for where this combate is 
there is soundness of grace mixed with corruption
q 
how doth the combate between the flesh and the spirit differ from that of the conscience and will or affections
a 
1 
they differ in their ground or cause 
for whereas the spiritual conflict ariseth from the grace of regeneration 
whereby the gifts and graces of gods spirit 
being infused into all our powers and faculties 
do make us warre against our carnal corruptions and fleshly lusts 
the conflict which is in the unregenerate ariseth from that light which shineth into the mind 
and ransacketh the heart 
and discovereth to the conscience what is right or wrong 
good or evil 
thus the understanding by the light of nature or common grace discerning in particular actions what is good and to be embraced 
and what is evil to be shunned 
informeth the conscience accordingly 
and leaveth it to her censure and determination 
either to approve us for the doing of good and forsaking of evil 
or to condemn us for the doing of evil 
and neglecting of good 
but the will being transported by its own sinfull corruption 
and sometime overswaied with the violence of the sensitive appetite and affections 
it hearkeneth unto them 
and stoppeth the ears to reason and conscience 
for example 
the understanding informeth us that god is to be honoured above all 
that our parents are to be
reverenced and obeyed 
that we must love our enemies 
do good to all men 
but the will perverted with the baits of worldly vanitiesexo

doth rise up in open rebellion against reason and conscience 
and resolveth that it will do what it listeth 
and go on in its own course 
2 
they are differenced by the manner of conflict 
for the one is free and voluntary 
the other forced and constrained 
the will of the regenerate freely chooseth good 
refuseth evil 
and laboureth the expulsion of inhabiting corruption 
but the will of the unregenerate is bent upon evil 
and liketh not 
willingly admitteth not any thing that makes against it 
in all this conflict between conscience and affection 
reason and appetite 
there is no enmity and contrariety between them in their natures 
neither is there more grace or less corruption in the reason and conscience 
then in the will and affectionscautus enim metuit foveam lupus

for they as well as these do like and love sinne with the pleasures and profits of it in its own nature 
if they were not deterred with the fearfull consequences of gods judgments and punishments 
which they see will necessarily follow upon such sinfull premises 
others propound the difference thus 
the spirit is moved to assault the flesh by the true love of god 
which causeth it to make warre against carnal lusts 
because they are odious unto him 
as being enemies to his grace 
and contrary to his holy will 
and by a filial fear of his majesty which maketh the man regenerate loath to yeeld unto any motions of sinne 
least he should thereby displease and offend him 
but the combate between the conscience and affections ariseth from self-love and servile fear 
which make the man unregenerate to withstand the motions of sinne in the will and affections 
for fear of those punishments 
which will accompany his sinnes 
as horrour of conscience 
shame 
corporall paine 
eternal death and hellish condemnation 
3 
there is a difference between these conflicts in respect of the combatants 
for in the combate between the flesh and the spirit 
there is a conflict between grace and corruption 
in the same faculties 
not arising from discourse upon outward grounds of ensuing mischiefs 
but from a reall change of their nature wrought by gods spirit 
which yet is but imperfect 
but in the combate which is in the unregenerate 
the conflict is between divers faculties 
which are all carnal and corrupted 
fighting one of them against another 
not out of hatred of sinne or love of goodness 
but from the apprehension of outward things that may follow upon the committing of sinne 
whereby the heart is not moved at all to turn unto god 
but notwithstanding all danger continueth stiffe and obstinate 
4 
where there is only a combate between conscience and affection 
there usually follows one of these two things 
either policy to rock conscience asleep 
and subtilty to deceive it with carnal pretences or despair if it cannot be deluded 
but the will that is truly renewed by grace 
as it abhorres the evil whereunto it is inticed 
so it useth all gracious means to avoid it 
and declineth whatsoever might allure unto the practice of evil 
5 
these combates are distinguished in their effects 
first 
the unregenerate conscience gainsayeth sinne 
but prevaileth not against it 
and usually this is the occasion to hasten the committing of it 
because the more we are restrained 
the more desperatly we rebell against the law 
corruption being too strong for reason unsanctfied 
but the sanctified will 
as it is assisted by grace to hate sinne as sinne 
so it is enabled thereby in the use of holy means to withstand the assaults of the flesh 
or if through violence of tentation or neglect of means it be overtaken 
this proves a gracious occasion to prevent further evils of security 
pride 
&ampc 
and drives unto christ for further sanctification 
secondly 
the warre between the spirit 
and the flesh causeth unto us the most secure peace 
even peace with god who hath given us his spirit to assure us of his favour and strengthen us in this spiritual fight 
against his and our enemies 
peace between the faculties of our souls 
when as the inferiour faculties
are in quiet subjection to the superiour 
it bringeth also with it unspeakable joy 
spiritual comfort 
and sound refreshing 
because it is an evidence of our regeneration 
a pledge of gods love 
an assurance of full and final victory over all our enemies 
but the conflict of conscience in the unregenerate 
causeth continuall garboyls and hot dissention 
tyranny in the superiour faculties ruling only by servile fear 
and rebellion in the inferiour 
when they have power to break the yoke of government 
horrour and anguish of mind 
disconsolate sorrow and hellish despair 
when the affright of conscience beareth sway 
or the mad and tumultuous joy of frantick men 
when the wild affections and disordered passions do silence conscience and get the upper-hand 
finally 
that conflict between the flesh and the spirit 
makes the man regenerate with more care and diligence to observe his own heart 
carefully to renew his repentance 
and conscionably to watch over all his waies 
but the conflict of conscience is commonly joyned with secure wretchlessness 
whereby the unregenerate man doth carelesly neglect the causes and occasions of this bitter conflict 
untill he be overtaken with them 
and only avoideth the punishment and not the sinne which causeth it 
or the sinne only 
when he is sensible of the punishment 
and that in respect of the outward act for servile fear of paine and smart 
not with a free and willing heart 
6 
the spirit and flesh doth in all things oppose against one another 
the spirit the flesh in all that is evil 
the flesh the spirit in all that is good 
for there is no good action which the spiritual man performeth 
but the flesh interposing 
hindereth and interrupted it 
and contrariwise there is no evil known to the spirit and done by the flesh 
wherein the spirit doth not cross and oppose it 
but the conflict of conscience extendeth not to the whole course of life 
but only to some particular actions 
and yeelding unto the will in ordinary 
common 
and lesser sinnes 
it only contendeth with them about the committing of such sinnes as are hanious and outragious 
and especially against the second table 
7 
the last difference between these divers conflicts is in respect of time 
for the combate between the flesh and the spirit begins at the time of regeneration 
and not before 
and being begun it is continual and constant to the very end of our lives 
though it may have some intermissions in respect of our sense and feeling 
but the combate of conscience doth begin oftentimes long before conversion 
even as soon as we have the use of reason and understanding 
but it is neither constant nor continuall 
but onely by pangs and fits 
upon occasion of some sinne already acted 
or about to be committed
q 
is this combate of conscience in all unregenerate men
a 
it is not in them only 
nor yet in all 
for this combate may also be in the faithfull and regenerate 
yet not in the part regenerate 
for the sanctified will and affections do not oppose the sanctified conscience and reason 
but in the unregenerate part even the faithfull themselves do feel this conflict in them 
between conscience accusing for fear of judgment and punishment 
and carnal concupiscence drawing them to sinne 
the which is more weak on that side of passion 
because their corruption is much abated and subdued 
but stronger on the side of conscience 
because it is excited with a greater illumination 
discovering more manifestly the odiousness of sinne 
and fearfulness of those punishments which it diserveth 
howsoever in another respect the violence of it is abated 
namely 
as it terrifieth with servile fearrom

nor is this combate in all unregenerate persons 
as in men extreamly ignorant or outragious wicked 
who have blotted out the law of nature 
and are given up into a reprobate sense 
this conflict is seldom in simple people 
that know not the law 
subtile wits 
that are cunning to daube over sinneluk

how differs this combate between the flesh and the spirit from that between the remainders of gods image 
and the power of corruption in the same faculty

though it be very weak 
corrupt and defective 
therefore a man continuing in the state of nature 
may sinne with reluctation 
feel some conflict against it in will 
and as judas had 
have his after-grief for it 
but this combate differs from the spiritual 
whereof we intreat in many things 
1 
the natural man hath a reluctation betwixt the remnants of natural light 
and moral inclination of the will on the one side 
and the enormous aberration of his sensual wilfulness on the other 
but the godly mans resistance is between a new divine quality in judgment 
will and affections wrought by the spirit of god on the one side 
and the remainders of our native corruption on the other 
2 
this combate between the remainders of gods image and the power and reign of sinne 
is only in things natural or moral 
which may be discerned to be good or evil by the light of nature 
but the conflict between the flesh and the spirit is general 
specially in things spiritual and supernatural 
the natural man sinneth with reluctation in grosser crimes 
such as the world doth note 
but the righteous man in lesser 
such as no man can challenge him for 
he hath after-grief 
but it is in such crimes 
as nature her self 
less corrupted 
judgeth reproachfullfieri non potest 
qu ut qualis quisque fit 
tala operetur 
znch in eph 
515 
whereas the godly mans grief is even in good duties 
that sinne will not let him do them 
as he would 
for all acts be in nature answerable to the qualities from which they flow 
and correspondent to the power and will of the worker 
but there is no liberty of will in spiritual things remaining in the natural man 
untill he be renewed by grace 
he hath no ability to will or choose what is truly good and acceptable 
and having no power to any thing supernatural 
how can there be any combate in him touching them 
with the regenerate it fareth better 
for by the infusion of grace he is set at liberty to will 
desire 
choose and prosecute the things that belong unto his peace 
in which he is mightily opposed by the flesh 
3 
the natural man 
though he purpose not this or that particular sinne 
yet to follow his own unrenewed mind and will 
he alwaies purposeth and resolveth with full consent 
but he that hath a contrary spirit cannot be resolute and intire in following his own will 
but intendeth and setteth down with himself to walk uprightly before god 
if he offend in any thing it is besides his purpose 
when the naturalist standeth firme 
he is fast in bondage 
but when the regenerate slippeth 
he is but half in sinne 
for as he cannot so resolutely do the good he would 
because sinne lusteth against grace 
so he cannot fully consent to sinne 
because the spirit of grace lusteth against sinne in him 
but the unregenerate hath set down with himself to persist in a sinfull course 
even when he contendeth against the breaking forth of some evil that stirreth in him 
4 
in this combate betwixt the remainders of gods image and power of corruption 
men follow their natural disposition 
are indulgent to their corrupt inclination 
aim at sinister ends and by-respects 
as pleasure 
profit 
praise and reputation 
at least 
intend not the glory of god 
or the mortification of the body of sinne 
but the regenerate labour to crucifie and weaken the law of sinne 
to kill the lusts of the flesh 
that with more freedom of spirit they might serve god in righteousness and true holiness 
the civil honest man detesteth theft 
murder 
adultery 
gross and disgracefull cosenage 
because he is not bent to such practises 
but as for putting off of lusts 
to which naturally his heart enclines 
he thinks it needless 
and that god who hath made 
and knoweth our natures 
doth not expect we should be freed from that 
which is by nature in us 
the renewed christian is of another mind 
for having put on christ 
he hath put off the willing service of all sinfull lusts 
and studies daily to approve himself unto
god in well-doing 
5 
the remainders of gods image in the natural man are weak and feeble 
easily overborn with the violent rage of corruption 
small occasions thrust men into the committing of that evil 
which they dislike 
and condemn in others 
as fear of loss 
shame 
disgrace 
hope of gain 
favour 
or such like 
but in the regenerate the power of grace is more lively and strong 
and the force of corruption in part subdued 
that they be not ordinarily foiled 
or drawn to live after the flesh 
yet here it is to be noted 
that inordinate lusts are not utterly banished by the spirit of sanctification 
that we should not be molested with them 
onely they exercise not their tyranny over us 
as in the daies when we were in subjection to the flesh 
it is one thing to have sin mortified 
another not to feel the stirring and moving of it in us 
it is said truly then to be killed 
when that is done upon it 
which will make it die in time 
though it take on a while 
as a wound will ake and tingle after it is dressed with a healing plaister 
he that feeleth it a burthen 
wherewith he is unwilling to be laden 
he that desireth to be set free from it 
he that reneweth his faith toward christ 
who is made of god his sanctified 
and resteth on him to see these works of the devil utterly dissolved 
he hath mortified his sinne 
though the devil and sinne should rage and continue to tyrannze in him 
the voluntary subjection to it 
mortification presently causeth to cease 
the involuntary suffering of it 
is successively diminished 
but never till death totally removed
q 
what difference is there betwixt the combate which is to be found in the temporary 
and that which is proper to the regenerate
a 
besides the remainders of gods image 
the temporary believer is endued with the common graces of the spirit 
for substance not counterfeit 
though ineffectual to sanctification 
he is illightned with the knowledge of divine mysteries 
grounded upon the scripture 
which is not altogether idle and inefectual 
he is drawn to believe in some sort 
and with confidence to receive the word of the kingdom both as true and good 
he may reform himself in such sort 
that it may be said 
satan is cast out of him 
and all this not in hypocrisie 
or for fear of punishment 
but freely and according to the word of grace 
whereby he is moved to affect things that are above 
from whence followeth a combate in him farre greater and of another nature then that betwixt reason and appètite 
conscience and affection 
or the reliques of gods image with the power of sinne 
even of the common graces of the spirit with the power of corruption repressed 
not mortified or killed 
but the graces of the spirit are not soundly planted 
the word of the kingdom is not kindly received into the heart 
so as to rule with universall sovereignty 
and to season throughout the powers of the soul 
temporary christians make some account of gods favour and the joys of heaven in an inferiour place 
but their desire of happiness is subordinate to the things of this world 
in particular estimation 
which is joyned with choice of heart 
they preferre their special delights before christ 
and will rather leave him than leave the world 
if the one of necessity must be parted with 
wherefore the will of the best unregenerate man 
is still in captivity under the dominion of sinne 
and his heart of an earthly temper 
though it be somewhat changed by the superficial receipt of the word of life 
which it tasteth 
but digesteth not 
in which respect the motions of the unregenerate in the waies of godliness may be said to be dead and accidentall 
because the soul is not enlivened by the spirit of grace 
but the motion of the regenerate is lively and natural 
proceeding from the spirit of grace that dwelleth in them 
whereby they are quickned in the inner man 
hereby we may gather the difference of these combates 
first 
the spirit lusteth against all evil and corruption 
as against the ignorance 
vanity and folly of mind 
the frowardness and perversness of will 
whereby it is drawn from the chief good to esteem 
admire
affect 
approve and follow after things transitory 
that perish with the use 
and to shrink 
draw back 
and turn from the pursuit of things spiritual and supernatural 
when it is accompanied with manifold crosses and aflictions 
but the temporary christian doth voluntarily allow himself in the esteem and particular approbation of things pertaining to this life 
as in themselves most usefull 
and to us most necessary and excellent 
his interest in them he will not intirely forgo 
his title to them he will not deliberatly renounce 
no not that he might gain an eternal mansion promised in the word 
and in general esteemed by himself an excellent 
if at any time the light of truth rush in and convince the conscience 
specially when in practice it is made evident 
that comparatively he preferreth the lesser inferiour good 
he studieth not by hearty repentance to reform what is out of order 
but to cover the matter with shifts and devices 
distinctions and evasions 
that please himself 
and bleare conscience for a time 
secondly 
the spirit that quickneth the regenerate 
doth rule in them 
curbing and commanding all unruly passions and desires 
with authority and power 
rom

the law of the spirit of life

hath made me free from the law of sinne and death 
11 vers 
10 
if christ be in you 
the body is dead because of sinne 
but the spirit is life 
because of righteousness 
but the temporary believer 
even in the good things he doth 
is maimly led by his unsound and corrupt affections 
unto which the graces of the spirit be subordinate in him 
thirdly 
in the conflict betwixt the flesh and the spirit 
the better part doth ordinarily prevail and get the better 
that the regenerate cannot fulfill the lusts of the flesh 
nor walk according to the flesh 
for whosoever is born of god 
overcometh the world 
and this is the victory whereby we overcome the world 
even our faith

624 
but the unregenerate man is ever indulgent to his carnal and corrupt affections 
favoureth himself in his projects 
and willingly yeeldeth to be overcome in that course which is according to his inclination 
for he never setteth himself with any determined resolution to seek the subduing and crucifying of his speciall sinnes 
as earthlymindedness 
love of ease 
fear of trouble or persecution 
inordinate passion 
at all times he is favourable to them 
and when he is tryed in the particulars 
he will discover what he is

but they in part that are sanctified by the spirit

he should despise all men

a distinction must be
made betwixt these two 
having sinne and being a sinner in gods account 
such have sinne in whom corruption abideth and bringeth forth some fruits 
either hindering good 
or quenching the motions of the spirit 
or drawing them unto evil 
they are sinners 
who live in bondage and thraldom unto sinne 
and are taken captive of their lusts 
secondly 
the godly fall into sinne through frailty and infirmity 
when they be prevented of the temptation before they be aware2 chro 
3231 
or grow weary of making resistance 
or be left of god to try and humble them 
but they be not workers of iniquity 
committers of sinne in the phrase of scripture 
he that is born of god doth not commit sinne

which import as much as to sinne without strife and wrestling 
with delight and indulgence

doth sinnejoh

the same is the servant of sinne 
that is to say 
one that is commanded of sinne 
and tyrannized over by sinne 
as a drudge who cannot but do whatsoever his master commandeth him 
whereby it is evident 
that by sinning is meant 
no one sin how great and grievous soever it be 
that excepted which is against the holy ghost 
but continuance with pleasure and indulgencejoh

he meaneth not only that iniquity was committed by themsal 
103 
psal 
283 
but he signifieth that it was studiously committed 
as a man studieth or useth his art or occupation

there is no darkness nor shadow of death 
where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves

but they walk according to the flesh 
not who through infirmity do slip into that which is evil 
but to whom the flesh or the things of the flesh 
is the principle and chief scope of life 
but they in whose mind and purpose the spirit doth flourish 
that the purpose and institution of life should depend upon 
they are said to walk according to the spirit 
though now and then some things happen 
which do more resemble the nature of the flesh then of the spirit 
yea 
sometime it falleth out in this infirmity 
that in the regenerate themselves 
the flesh doth more shew it self then the spirit 
and though by a certain general motion of true faith the mind bend unto god 
yet there is something in particular causes that hinds its light 
whereby he becomes too indulgent to his affections 
but if all things be referred to the flesh 
they are said to walk according
to the flesh 
although they occasionally do many things which seem to pertain to the spirit
q 
is it not a note of the child of god 
that his conscience checketh him for sinne
a 
this work of conscience is to be found in unbelievers 
even in all them who are touched with any sense of right and wrong 
just and unjust 
for in them the conscience doth not cease to strive against the flesh 
untill it be seared and past all sense 
but the resistance of conscience doth not hinder the full consent of will in sinning 
rather it aggravates the sinne 
and declareth the proneness of the will to be so strong 
that it cannot be hindered from consent by the work of conscience 
but this is not the combate which we require and describe 
for in that there is some thing 
from which there is respect towards god 
as to hate sinne for god 
to hunger and thirst after righteousness 
to afflict the flesh 
seriously to be displeased 
to ask pardon 
and make supplication for grace 
and though in this conflict sin be not evermore prevented 
yet it ever succeedeth to true repentance 
and causeth to profit daily to a setled will not to offend
q 
when the godly consent to sinne 
doth the spirit lust against the flesh
a 
2 
concerning the act of sinne it is true 
that the will being overcome by the occasion doth give back 
not without the grief of the holy spirit 
but yet so that the spirit doth soon resume its rule and government 
and casts forth the enemy let in 
and by how much the greater breach hath been made 
by so much it taketh care to fortifie all entrances that it invade not again 
2 
in the act of sinning after a wonderfull manner that is committed against the will 
which yet cannot be committed but by the will 
for there is in the will of man regenerate something mixt 
that it both willeth good with godly affection 
and desires it 
but being not perfectly regenerate it lusteth after evil which is contrary to good 
to imagin that the will is not capable of spiritual gifts is most absurd 
for the scripture attributing puritymat

goodness 
uprightness to the heart 
doth evidently convince that supernatural graces are infused into the will 
unless we will place the most excellent gifts of divine grace in the unreasonable part of the soul 
moreover 
the habituall aversion and turning of the soul from the lust of playing the adulteress with carnal things 
is it not a wonderfull change 
in like manner 
an infused free-given habituall goodness 
is to be acknowledged in the will 
which is presupposed to all godly actions 
for seeing the scripture teacheth 
that god doth circumcise the heart 
take away the stony heart 
and give an heart of flesh 
and incline the heart to walk in his waies 
how can we imagine that the mind should be enlightned and the affections healed 
when the will is naked and destitute of divine grace 
now seeing the will is in part renewed and in part corrupted 
what absurdity is it 
that there should be contrary wishes in it at one and the same time 
as there be contrary inclinations 
though when the one prevails 
the other gives place 
when the heart consents to evil 
the regenerate man shall find cause to accuse himself of sloth and negligence 
in not stirring up the graces of gods spirit 
and seeking aid from above 
but hence it doth not follow 
that the will doth fully agree to that which is evil 
or that the renewed part doth wholly cease to make resistance
q 
what is the issue or event of this fight
a 
the issue of it is to prevail against the flesh 
but not without much molestation

walk in the spirit 
and fulfill not 
or ye shall not fulfill 
the lusts of the flesh 
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit 
and
the spirit against the flesh 
and these are contr ary the one to the other 
so that ye cannot do the things that ye would 
the exhortation of the apostle is in the 16th verse 
which for the ambiguity of the greek word may be read two waiesbeza annot in gal 
516 
fulfill ye 
or 
ye shall fulfill 
if it be read after the first manner 
then the exhortation stands of two parts 
of which the one teacheth what is to be done 
the other what is to be omitted 
to wit 
we must walk in the spirit 
and not fufill the lusts of the flesh 
but if we read them after the second manner 
then it contains an exhortation in these words 
walk in the spiritparaeus in gal 
510 
and a consectary adjoyned to the exhortation 
and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh 
and this reading seemes most agreeable to the mind of the apostle 
to the scope and circumstances of the place 
the scope is 
to prescribe an antidote to carnal liberty 
for in the 13th verse he exhorted the galatians 
that they would not abuse their christian liberty for an occasion to the flesh 
now in this verse 
he bringeth a remedy 
how they might repress and bridle the rage and violence of the flesh 
if ye walk in the spirit 
then it shall come to pass that we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh 
and the reason following in the 17th verse 
doth more confirm 
that the flesh is tamed and bridled of the spirit 
as of the contrary 
because contraries are expelled and cured by contraries 
by this it appears 
that the later reading is most fit to the sense of the apostle 
and so is it best approved of by learned and judicious authors 
the end or event of that combate is described in these words 
and these two are contrary 
that ye cannot do the things that ye would 
which if it be referred to the words immediatly going before 
then it may be interpreted of the will regenerate and unregenerate 
which mutually lust one against another 
and hinder each other that they cannot do what they would 
but if it be referred to the exhortation before-going 
then it must necessarily be understood of the regenerate power of the soul 
which doth curb and bridle the desires of the flesh 
that they break not forth into action 
this sense the scope of the apostle 
and the reason alledged by him 
doth evidently require 
for how doth it follow from the contrariety between the flesh and the spirit 
that we shall not follow the lusts of the flesh 
if we walk in the spirit 
unless in event the spirit get the victory 
touching the prevailing of the spirit these rules are to be observed 
1 
the spirit prevails not in one instant 
but in the generall whole course of a mans life 
so the apostle john saith 
he that is born of god sinneth not 
for he preserveth himself1 joh 
518 
19 the grace of god in his heart ordinarily prevailing in him 
and paul makes it the property of the regenerate man 
to walk according to the spiritrom 
82 
13 
which is not now and then to make a step forward 
but to keep his ordinary course in the way of godliness 
as in going from barwicke to london 
it may be 
a man now and then will go amiss 
but he speedily returns to the way again 
and his generall course shall be right 
the man that is led by the spirit doth for the most part walk in the perfect undefiled way 
though now and then he may go astray 
and slip aside 
2 
the spirit prevails not without much striving 
resistance 
pain and difficulty 
this conflict of the regenerate resembleth the practice of a sick man 
who being recovered of some grievous disease 
walks a turn or twain about his chamber 
saying 
ah 
i would fain walk up and down 
but i cannot 
meaning 
not that he cannot walk at all 
but signifying that he cannot walk as h would 
being soon wearied through faintness 
the graces of the spirit be imperfect in degree 
as is the strength of the sick person 
which causeth wearisomness in the christian course 
the effect of this weakness is 
that it stirreth up earnest longings and desires of more perfect recovery and fuller strength 
for as the feeling of bodily weariness causeth desire of perfect health and ability to stirre with more ease and speed 
so doth the sense of spirituall infirmity 
3 
this prevailing of the spirit 
causeth not that all concupiscence doth utterly cease 
or is altogether extinguished in the faithfull 
that none vex or trouble them 
but
that it exercise not dominion over them 
and draw them at pleasure whether it will 
the apostle saith not 
the lusts of the flesh shall not entice 
annoy or trouble you 
but ye shall not be in subjection unto it 
it shall not hale and draw you to fulfill the desires of it 
it shall not tyrannize in you 
as it doth over the unregenerate 
the power of corruption is abated by little and little through the prevailing of the spirit 
but corruption doth still abide 
and the motions of it will still arise in the soul 
so long as we live in this world 
4 
this prevailing is not without some foyls 
when god is pleased to leave them to themselves 
that they might know what is in them2 chro 
323 
or the temptation rusheth violently upon them before they be aware 
or else they grow weary of the fight 
and cast down their weapons 
this happeneth through the ignorance 
infirmity 
negligence 
and sometimes security of the best of gods servants that live in this world 
the best learned are ignorant of many things 
know nothing for measure as they ought 
and experience witnesseth 
that many things fall out of our minds by tentation 
and come into forgetfulness 
which would have been of great use then 
and were known before 
besides 
whatsoever we are 
we are imperfect 
hard and slow to understand 
apt and prone to forget 
slack heavy and weak in will 
changeable and uncertain in affections 
in all which 
imbred pravity doth cause 
that in this mortal body we carry about with us daily an army of vices 
with which we must conflict at all times in every moment 
but in what things soever we are imperfect 
in them also we are weak 
therefore when we cannot be sufficiently attent amidst these warres 
nor sufficiently fenced for all purposes 
we must needs fall sometimes 
nor can the occasions of sinne that creep suddainly upon us 
altogether be prevented 
and wholly overcome 
but if by the corrupt disposition of nature we commit so many things not well 
what shall be done when force of tentation 
and vehement motion of passions shall be added to it 
what servant of god is there living upon earth 
who doth not feel the motions of the flesh urging to that which is evil 
and forcing him to complain 
o miserable man that i am 
who is not interrupted in his best duties with vain 
unseasonable 
roving thoughts 
base 
filthy and wicked 
who is not hindered with unbelief 
clogged with sloth 
deadness 
hardness of heart 
distracted with vain pleasures and worldly cares 
who do not runne into no small offences 
being darkned with the clouds of ignorance 
who doth not offend in many things every day by negligence 
sloth 
idleness 
disregard and want of watchfulness 
of which he repents at evening 
and in which there is cause he should repent again in the morning 
yea 
no doubt some deal more boldly 
and by reason of infirmity presume of infirmity 
and grow too indulgent to themselves in many things because they are weak 
certainly as it hapneth in a civil common-wealth the kingdom standing 
that some parts are molested by in-rodes and incursions of the enemies 
and can hardly fortifie themselves so strongly 
that they should not be compelled to bear spoyles and robberies with their great damage 
so it falleth out in our spiritual state 
the kingdom of christ being confirmed in us 
that to our great loss we suffer the invasion of the enemy 
thus we may see some faithfull men to be overgrown with earthlimindedness 
rusted with idleness 
carried away with vanity 
puffed up with pride 
distempered with anger 
inclined to rash censuring 
and which is more to be lamented 
sometimes through heedlesseness 
security and presumption 
the godly are overtaken and fall into some gross or notorious offences 
in this case 
the spirit for the time being vanquished and subdued by the flesh 
not quite extinguished 
the man regenerate is like a souldier 
that with a blow hath his brain-pan cracked 
so as he lies groveling astonished 
not able to fight 
or like him that hath a fit of the falling-sickness 
who for a time lies like a dead man 
how farre the child of god may fall 
is to be handled in more fit place hereafter 
here it is sufficient to note 
that a man soundly regenerate and born anew
can never sin so as to be wholly cut off from christ 
in respect of inward comfort 
fellow ship and communion he may be cut off from christ 
but not in respect of union and conjunction with him 
a mans arm taken with the dead palsie 
hangs by 
and receives no heat 
life or sense 
from the rest of the members 
or from the head 
yet for all this it remains still united and coupled to the body 
and may again be recovered by plaisters and physick 
so after a grievous fall the child of god feels no inward peace and comfort 
but is smitten in conscience with the trembling of a spiritual palsie for his offence 
and yet indeed still remains before god a member of christ in respect of conjunction with him 
and shall be restored to his former estate after serious repentance 
when the believer falleth into gross notorious sinne 
he is not cast from the state of justification and adoption 
the seed of grace perisheth not utterly 
faith is not clean extinguished 
but for the present he hath cast himself into a damnable condition 
lyeth under the fatherly wrath of god 
and hath made himself unapt immediately to enter into the kingdom of heaven 
immediately unaptpsal

i say 
for god hath instituted this order 
that the act of repentance should go before the benefit of pardon 
and in his holy word ordained 
that no unclean thing should enter into the kingdom of heaven 
nor is this doctrine any way prejudicial to the grace of god 
as if the flesh were stronger than the spirit 
for the grace of god shall certainly uphold and lead the elect and faithfull to the participation of eternal life 
in which work the lord doth take away all will of actual resisting his blessed spirit 
but the principall acts without which the salvation of the elect cannot stand 
must be distinguished from other subsequent acts in themselves not absolutely necessary to salvation 
as to avoid this or that sinne 
to omit the doing of this or that particular good 
for the producing of the former 
grace doth so work 
that it gives to the elect in due time both to be able 
and to will and to do 
to the other the guidance of the spirit is not wanting to useph 
430 
but we may be and are oft wanting to the grace of god 
the spirit is able to sanctifie us throughout 
and to uphold us from falling 
but he worketh as he pleaseth 
not as he is able 
as he knowes it to be for the glory of god 
and the good of the elect 
not ever to the producing of this or that particular good 
or the hindering of this or that particular evil 
because the lord in his infinite wisdom knowes it not to be expedient 
besides 
god is not wanting to us in any thing necessary to salvation 
or that he hath promised in the covenant of grace 
but when we are foyled 
we are wanting to our selves 
and must bear the blame of our transgression 
but what we do evilly 
that god ordereth by his surpassing wisdom to a most excellent end 
for god permits these foyles for weighty causes 
first 
that men might be abased and confounded in themselves with the consideration of their vile natures 
and learn not to swell with pride 
because of gods grace 
paul saith2 cor 
127 
8 
that after he had been rapt up into the third heaven 
the messenger of satan was sent to buffet him 
and 
as we say 
to beat him black and blew 
that he might not be exalted out of measure 
secondly 
that we may learn to deny our selves 
and cleave unto the lord from the bottom of our hearts 
paul saith2 cor 
19 
that he was sick to death 
that he might not trust in himself 
but in god who raiseth the dead the effects following upon the foyles of the part regenerate are these 
first 
unfeigned and bitter sorrow for our slips and fals 
of this we have example in the church 
who finding her failings and fals into sinneesa 
6317 
pitifully complaineth and cryeth out unto god for help 
o lord 
why hast thou made us to erre from thy waies 
and hardned our hearts from thy fear 
return for thy servants sake 
the tribes of thine inheritance 
secondlyrom 724 
an earnest and vehement desire to be freed from the slavery of sinne 
and to serve the lord in the duties of holiness and righteousness 
for as the needle in the dial which is touched with a loadstone may by a forcible motion turn
and wind to and fro 
but will never stand fixed and stedfast till it bend unto its own proper point 
so the heart of the regenerate touched with gods spirit 
howsoever through the violence of the flesh 
and strength of satans tentations 
it may be averted from god 
and turn this way and that way after the vanities of this world 
yet it never resteth till it be again returned and inclined towards him 
from whom it had first motion and being 
thirdly 
there followeth an uncessant care to use all means for the encrease of grace 
and to take all opportunities to subdue and crucifie the flesh 
as souldiers that have once felt the force of enemies 
do labour afterwards to withstand their fury by taking all occasions and advantages to weaken their might and power 
the fourth rule is 
that the spirit doth get full victory at the end of mans life 
for then the flesh is utterly abolished 
and sanctification accomplished 
because no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven
q 
what means must be used for the weakning of the flesh
a 
1 
we must not feed our flesh with sinfull pleasures and carnal delights 
nor give it ease and contentment by satisfying and glutting it with all worldly superfluities 
ease and delicacy 
immoderate use of lawfull recreations and voluptuous delights 
for though this might go for good policie between nation and nation 
to help forward their enemy in their voluptuous delights 
because hereby they are weakned and made effeminate 
yet it is not so in this conflict with the flesh 
seeing the more it is effeminated and pampered with carnal delights 
the more it is strengthened against the spirit 
to feed often liberally 
not refraining any thing to which ones appetite leadeth 
to be gratifying carnal desire 
now with one thing 
now with another 
alas 
what doth it 
it distempereth the flesh with lust 
it doth make the very soul fleshly affected 
it indisposeth us to those exercises which are performed by the mind 
it makes us fit to be kindled with anger or any such like passion 
finally 
it taketh up the minde with thought what it shall next be served with in this kinde 
2 
by all holy means we must restrain and withhold from the flesh whatsoever might nourish 
stirre up 
or strengthen sinne 
for example 
we must use our best endeavour to shut forth of the minde all sinfull cogitations 
vain imaginations 
wicked deliberations 
ungodly counsels 
pernicious errours 
false opinions 
the delightfull remembrance of sinfull pleasures 
we must preserve our hearts from all unlawfull lusts 
wicked desires 
unruly passions 
and ungodly affections 
especially from covetuousness 
ambition and carnal voluptuousness 
we must preserve our tongues from all corrupt communication 
our eyes from wanton and wicked objects 
our ears from dishonest and ungodly discourses 
and our mind and body from sloth 
idleness 
excessive delight and looseness 
finally 
we must not fulfill our inordinate desires in things lawfull 
but cross and curb them 
as david would not drink of the waters of bethel 
which he so wonderfully desired 
but if we cannot prevent the rising of evil thoughts and corrupt motions 
then it must be our wisdome to quench them with all speed 
and to watch against all things that might kindle and enflame them 
specially we must wath over our senses 
which being the gates of our souls 
do either let in or keep out friends and enemies 
3 
the flesh must be resisted in the first beginnings of sinne 
and in all occasions which it takethheb 313 
if we give sinne an inch 
it will take an ell 
it knoweth better how not to begin 
than having begun to make an end 
give the waters no passage 
it is most safe to encounter the enemy before he hath set foot upon our borders 
or if he have made entrance before we were aware 
to drive him out before he be entrenched 
and as we must resist the first motions 
so must we shunne all occasions of sinne 
he that feareth death 
if he be wise 
he will not drink poyson 
nor thrust himself into needless and dangerous quarrels 
nor expose his person to any perils which threaten destruction 
he that would preserve his riches which he loveth 
will not entertain occasions of needless
expences 
much less suffer his doors to stand wide open in the night 
or invite known thieves to lodge with him 
4 
we must neglect no sinne 
as though we were in no danger of falling into it 
nor esteem any sin so small as that we may willingly or negligently commit it 
we are prone to all sinne 
if god leave us to our selves 
and the hurt of the least sinne is exceeding dangerous 
the smallest sinne is an aversion from god 
the transgression of his law 
the violater of his justice 
it defileth the soul 
woundeth conscience 
weakneth the power of grace 
grieveth the spirit 
hardneth the heart 
makes entrance for greater 
and disinableth to fight manfully against the most notorious offences 
and here let us be warned 
that we excuse not our selves in any slip or oversight 
though it appear little or small 
for sin will harbour where it is defended and countenanced 
and if we plead for it by way of excusing 
we cannot set against it in good earnest 
nor will slight dislike be of force to keep it under 
5 
our mortification must be without stint or restraint 
extending it self in respect of the object 
unto all our lusts 
and not unto some only 
in respect of the time it must be continuall 
even to the very end of our lives 
and in respect of degree 
we must not content our selves to have overcome and mortified all our sinfull lusts in some small measure 
but we must labour and strive after perfection2 cor 
71 
1 thes 
523
q 
what means must be used for the cheering and strengthening of the spirit unto this conflict
a 
1 
we must earnestly desire to have the spirit more strengthened 
and the gifts and graces thereof enlarged and multiplied 
for as we have gods promise 
that if wanting the spirit 
we do desire and pray for itluk 
1113 
he will give him unto us 
so also when having it 
we desire to have all graces encreasedpsal 
14518 
the lord will satisfie our desires 
2 
we must nourish the good motions of the spirit 
neither quenching them 
nor delaying to practice them 
for it much cheereth and delighteth this heavenly counsellour 
when as we hearken to his counsels 
and be advised by him in our courses 
3 
serious care to maintain peace with god 
is a speciall means to strengthen the spirit 
for if god be offended how shall his spirit be well pleased with us 
how shall he be willing to renew our strength 
to send unto us new supplies of his graces

continuall exercise is necessary to preserve and strengthen the graces of the spirit 
we find by experience that the sight is bettered by seeing 
and much weakned when it is deprived of fit objects 
the habituall memory is much strengthened by the practicall 
and made feeble and unfaithfull when as it hath no exercise or imployment 
sloth and remisseness is a great enemy to bodily health and thrift

q what are the effects of this combate
a 
1 
from this conflict between the flesh and the spirit 
arising from the imperfection of our regeneration 
this effect is wrought and caused in the man regenerate 
that he can neither perfectly will good 
nor hate evil 
for when the will 
as it is regenerate 
would do that which is good 
or avoid and shun that which is evil 
that part which remaineth unregenerate struggleth and hindereth 
and when this would embrace the evil or refuse the good 
the regenerate part resisteth and opposeth 
2 
the best acts of the regenerate fall short of perfection required 
for the action cannot exceed the habite from which it springeth 
if the one be defective 
the other is faulty 
the cause of works in man are the mind 
will and affections sanctified 
in which the flesh and the spirit are mixt together 
therefore works of grace 
even the best of them 
are mixt works 
partly holy 
partly sinfull 
if any reply 
that good works are the works of the holy spirit 
and for that cause perfectly righteous 
i answer 
it is true indeed 
they
come from the holy ghost that cannot sin 
but not only or immediately 
for they come from the mind and will of man 
which are regenerate only in part 
and have much of the old man remaining in them 
and thereupon must nees infuse some uncleanness into the effects produced by them 
3 
the regenerate cannot do the evil which the flesh lusteth aftergal

first 
he cannot commit sin at what time soever the flesh would 
he that is born of god sinneth not 
neither can he sin 
because he is born of god

399 
hew can i do this great wickedness and sinne against god 
and what restrained him 
surely the fear of god and his holy spirit 
which would not suffer him to fall into so great wickedness 
secondly 
he cannot commit sin as the wicked do with full 
intire 
perfect resolution 
for sin being deposed from its regency 
cannot reign and rule in the whole man as in times past 
so much grace as is wrought in the mind 
will 
affections 
so much is abated proportionally of the strength of the fleshabbat

but some divines do use this distinction 
that the full will to sin may be understood two waies 
for either it is so expounded as when it is said the whole world 
and so the whole man 
lyeth in sin 
and the whole will is addicted to nothing but sin 
or that it should be carried with all its force into this or that act of sin 
without any reluctancy and resistance 
in the former sense the regenerate cannot sin with full consent 
but in the latter they may 
not only in lesser 
but even in greater trespasses 
that for the time there be felt no resistance 
thirdly 
he cannot walk in the way of sinners 
but propoundeth unto himself to worship god in holiness and righteousness 
in which course though sometime he slippeth and falleth 
yet by the grace of the spirit he recovereth again 
and returneth into the right way 
fourthly 
by reason of this conflict the man regenerate cannot do the good the spirit willeth 
nor yeeld that perfect obedience to the law of god which it requireth and he desireth 
for when he would runne the christian race 
the sinne that compasseth him doth cling about his neck 
and either maketh him for weariness to sit down 
or to runne forward slowly and with great difficulty 
it is true 
that in this conflict the flesh doth not wholly hinder and withdraw the regenerate man from performing of his duty 
nor alienate his mind and heart from the study and embracing of goodness and righteousness 
but yet still it endeavoureth to do it 
and though it cannot make him to stand still or turn back again 
yet like an heavy burden it presseth him down 
and hindereth him in his journey 
the consideration whereof should move every christian to be humbled in the sight of his own frailty 
wants and imperfections 
to deny himself and his own righteousness 
that he may wholly rest upon the grace and mercy of god in jesus christ 
it should also move us to watch and prayprov

this combate is against the root of evil and the first motions of it 
not only against notorious sinnes or the gross outward acts

the malitiousness of this little member should make us to watch over it with great care 
for as the psalmist 
and the apostle paul 
describe the effects and fruits of it 
it deviseth mischief

it speaketh deceit 
and loveth to lie rather then to speak righteousness 
it delighteth in devouring words 
it cutteth as a sword 
and the poyson of aspes is under the lips 
so the apostle james telleth us 
that the tongue as much needeth restraint 
as an unruly horse the bridle 
and compareth it to the helm of a ship which being little turneth about the whole body 
and to a fire inflamed by hell 
and setting on fire a whole world with wickedness 
a man of an evil tongue 
is a beast in the form of a man 
for his tongue is the tongue of a serpent 
under whch lyeth nothing but venom and poyson 
nay 
he is worse then a serpent 
for it cannot hurt 
unless it be present to see a man 
or to bite him 
or to strike him with his tayl 
but he which hath not the rule of
his tongue 
hurteth men as well absent as present

neither filthiness 
nor foolish talking 
nor jesting 
which are not convenient 
of every idle word that men shall speak 
they must give an account at the day of judgment

that it is a point of wisdome to make choice of the best matters to be the object of our communication 
matters of religion 
faith 
hope 
repentance 
sanctification 
the priviledges of a christian 
and the way to salvation 
of things left to free election 
what wise man will not preferre the most excellent 
usefull and comfortable 
more particularly 
the matter of our speech is either concerning god and his works 
our neighbour and things pertaining to him 
and our persons and occasions 
god hath made known his name that we might publish his praise 
and talk of his wondrous works 
he established a testimony in jacob 
and appointed a law in israel 
which he commanded our fathers 
that they should make them known to their children 
that the generation to come might know them 
and christians are commanded to exhort 
admonish 
rbuke 
comfort and build up one another in their most holy faith 
which they cannot do 
unless they speak one to another 
to encourage in grace and godliness 
but these caveats must be remembred 
first 
that the honourable titles of the glorious god be never taken into our mouthes 
unless it be upon a weighty and just occasion 
that glory may redound to him thereby 
at which time we should finde our hearts lively affected with due consideration of that great majesty before whom we speaklev 
1912 
deut

whose glorious and fearfull name we mention 
the precept is 
thou shalt not defile the name of the lord 
but fear his glorious name 
but the name of god is polluted 
when it is tossed to and fro in mens ordinary speech 
without due respect of his incomprehensible greatness 
secondly 
if the matter of our speech concern the person of our brother 
the rule is 
to speak of the good thou knowest by him 
readily 
truly 
chearfully 
behind his back rather than in his presence 
and that indifferently 
wheter he be friend or fo 
as st john writeth of demetrius3 ioh

saith he 
hath good report of all men 
and of the truth it self 
yea 
and we our selves bear record 
and ye know that our testimony is true 
but of evil 
whether it be infirmity or gross sinne 
saying or deed 
we must not speak without a calling 
without grief 
according to our knowledge 
not by hear-saytit 
32 
and that as little as may be 
warne them that they speak evil of no man 
but be soft 
and shewing all meekness to all men 
when we are lawfully
called before a magistrate to bear witness of the truth 
we may testifie our knowledge 
when hurt or danger may arise to others by evil 
if it be not prevented 
we may wisely intimate our knowledge 
when the evil is common and notorious we may complain to them that have authority to redress it 
that further mischief might be prevented 
in these and such like cases it is lawfull to speak of the evil which we know by our neighbour 
but not otherwise 
to this end they of the house of cloe certified paul of the disorders in corinth1 cor 
111 
joseph enformed his father of the evil carriage of his brethren

without a just calling 
to uncover the nakedness of our brethren 
as cain did his fathers 
is a thing very unlawfull 
marvellous pernicious 
the root of it 
self-love 
or self-admiration 
the effect is hatred and contention 
he that is an admirer of himself 
desirous of vain-glory 
laboureth to rear his own praise out of the ashes of another mans disgrace 
and by the just judgment of god 
when men take liberty to talk broadly of other mens courses 
acts 
and manner of living 
they runne into hatred and contempt 
for what is spoken 
by one means or other cometh to be known 
and then 
what heart-burnings and secret boylings of passions may we see amongst brethren 
concerning things that are secret in our neighbour 
we are not to be suspicious 
but either to suspend both speech and judgment 
or to construe all things in the best sense1 cor 
45 
judge nothing before the time 
untill the lord come 
who will lighten things that are hid in darkness 
and make the counsels of the heart manifest 
love suspecteth no evil1 cor

as for sinnes in our neighbour 
we must deal plainly and truly with him

thou shalt freely and soundly rebuke him with conviction of arguments

it must be modest without vanity or boasting 
let another man praise thee

nay 
we should rather extenuate and lessen the good in us

as paul 
i am the least of the apostles 
it is a very unseemly thing for a man to applaud his own doing 
seeing to seek praise from others is damnable 
and worthily taxed of our saviour in the pharisees 
much more absurd it is to give commendations of himself vauntingly 
and to sound out his own praises 
we say of them 
that commend their own course 
by way of reproof 
he dwelleth by ill neighbours 
nevertheless it is necessary for a man in some cases to testifie his graces and his actions 
as in defence of his innocency 
when he is unjustly traduced 
as paul was 
or when the hiding or concealing of ones goodness 
may urn to the hinderance of the truth 
or to the hurt of the church 
or impairing of gods glory 
again 
a christian is not to dispraise himself or speak of things tending to his disgrace 
unless the glory of god

three things are implied herein 
1 
truth 
whereby a man speaketh as he knoweth things to be 
or according to the trule of truth 
it is made the note of a righteous man 
to speak the truth from the heart 
and they that deal truly are the lords delight 
speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour 
wherefore putting away lying 
speak every man truth with his neighbour 
the end of all good ends 
the glory of god 
cannot priviledge any mans lie 
the friends of job disputed against him 
though ignorantly 
thinking him to be an hypocrite 
and their whole scope was to magnifie the justice of god upon him 
but job 
holding nothing to be more dishonourable to god then to plead for him by a lie 
stands at defiance with them that sought to plead after that manner 
answering with detestation of that errour 
will you speak wickedly for god 
and talk deceitfully for him 
will you accept his person 
will you yet contend for god 
do you so mock him 
shall not his excellency make you afraid 
what refutation can be more emphaticall 
or yet more just 
for it is written 
it is impossible for god to lie 
and as impossible must we think it 
for god to approve or justifie any lie 
how much less wilfull lying 
if the verity of god 
saith the appostle 
hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory 
why yet am i also judged as a sinner 
and not rather as we be slanderously reported 
and as some affirm that we say 
let us do evil 
that good may come 
whose damnation is just 
the argument of the apostle is this 
though it be most in the verity of god 
that mans unrighteousness 
as for example a lie 
doth redound to the glory of gods grace in pardoning of the same unrighteousness of man by jesus christ 
according to the truth of the gospel of remission of sinne 
yet god forbid that any man should therefore multiply unrighteousness in sinning 
as for example lying 
that gods glory might be magnified in forgiving 
shewing that it were blasphemy to teach that it is lawfull for any to lie 
although it would establish and advance the glory of god in that wherein god is most glorified 
even the glory of his grace in pardoning sinne by jesus christ 
i love the truthverum amo 
verum mibi dici volo 
plaut 
saith he in the comicall poet 
i would have the truth told me 
2 
sincerity 
which is a vertue 
whereby we deal plainly 
and speak according to the conceit of the mind without deceit or doubling 
words are signes of things 
and notes of the sense of our mind 
as the conceits of the mind must consent with the truth of the thing 
so must the words of our mouth with the conceits of the mind 
he that speaketh otherwise then the thing is 
telleth an untruthphil

psal 
283 
prov

and he that speaketh a thing contrary to his mind 
useth deceit 
he that hath a froward heart 
findeth no good 
and he that hath a perverse tongue 
falleth into mischief 
3 
constancy or fidelity in all our lawfull sayings and promises 
when i therefore was thus minded 
did i use lightness 
or the things
that i purpose 
do i purpose according to the flesh 
that with me there should be yea yea 
and nay nay 
4 
a fourth vertue required in speech is reverence to god and man 
reverence to god is when we so speak of god 
his word 
titles and works 
that we shew reverence our selves 
and move reverence in others 
if thou wilt not keep 
saith the lord 
and do all the words of his law that are written in this book and fear the glorious and fearfull name of the lord thy god 
then the lord will make thy plagues wonderfull 
reverence to man isdeut 
2858 
either because he is created after the image of god 
or because he is above us in age 
gifts 
authority 
in which respect we must give fit speeches to all men 
and use due titles of reverence to our superiours1 pet

a wicked man may be outwardly honourable 
and thou maist not rob him without 
because he is already robbed within 
thou maist cast him down from spiritual judgments 
but not degrade him from his temporal dignity 
5 
modesty is an ornament of speech 
and must be manifested in sundry particulars 
first 
if a man speak any thing of himself that sounds to his own commendation 
let him alter the person 
and speak of himself as of another 
i knew a man

and heard words which cannot be spoken

6 
affableness or meekness is required in comunication 
when a man useth courteous and fair speeches 
this must be shewed in salutations 
answers 
reproofes 
daily experience can testifie that it maketh much for the maintaining of love 
to salute kindly and reverently by name 
profession 
calling or office 
by way of blessing 
our answers must be soft 
that anger be neither kindled nor encreased 
if we be railed on 
our duty is not to rail again 
but rather to bless and pray 
and either to keep silence or to return a mild and gentle answer 
and when a man hath so cleared himself 
though his own word in his own behalf take no effect 
yet he must patiently commit his cause to god 
and rest in the testimony of a good conscience 
our saviour makes answer to clear his innocency 
but when that canot take place 
he keepeth silence and will not speak one word 
reproof must be with meekness and moderation 
as chyrurgions use to handle limmes that be out of joynt 
this is done by request 
exhortation insinuating an oblique reproof 
parable 
joyning our selves with them and in our own person reproving their sinnes 
prevention 
wishing that such things be not found among them 
testifying our love by some preface that might make way for the kindly receipt of admonition 
and praising what is well done 
in a word 
we must shew our selves affable and gentle towards all men 
for nothing is more odious then for a man to shew himself harsh to them that sue unto him and desire his fellowship 
7 
it must be more earnest 
joyfull 
and comfortable when thou speakest of heavenly things 
then of earthly 
not jesting 
or foolish talking 
but rather giving of thanks

all our words must be seasonable 
fitted to the time 
place 
person 
occasion 
as well as seasoned 
wisdom will seek a season for good words 
for there is a season wherein the prudent will keep silence 
husbandmen observe seasons in sowing 
and so must he that looks for an harvest of his speeches 
abigail would not speak to her husband nabal in his drunkenness 
but when he had slept on his wine 
every man is not capable of every good speech 
nor any man at all times alike 
a word spoken in due season 
how good is it 
the fruit of the most generous tree is unsavoury 
if it be not ripe 
unseasonable rain doth much hurt 
as seasonable doth good 
so is the speech 
that in it self is good 
if it be not fit 
therefore as solomon saith 
a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment 
a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver 
two things adde grace to our words 
the one that they be true 
just and discreet 
the other that they be opportunely fitted to the circumstances of time 
place and person 
thus paul being at athens 
and seeing an altar dedicated to the ʋnknown god 
took occasion to informe them in the knowledge of the truth 
when joab perceived the heart of david to be somewhat inclined towards bsalom his sonne 
he suborned a wise woman to plead his cause before his father

that i might gaine the jews 
to them that are under the law 
as under the law 
that i might gaine thm that are under the law 
if god open the ear by affliction 
it is good to adjoyn exhortation 
admonition or comfort as occasion shall be offered 
for at such times words carry the greatest weight 
and sink deepest 
if the soul be weary with the burden of sinne 
and melteth with the apprehension of wrath 
it is to be eased with sweet words of consolation2 chro

when god vouchsafeth to lade us with undeserved favours 
it is a time to speak 
because the sense of mercy makes way for good advice and counsell 
to meet a man in the heat of his passion with good words 
is to meet a bear robbed of her whelps 
but let the passion be calm 
and then tell him how disguised and uncovered he was 
he will perhaps believe it
q 
what is to be observed touching the measure of our speech
a 
1 we must not speak too little 
and omit gracious speeches when occasion is offered 
as many dry and barren hearts and mouthes 
have not a word for god and goodness 
that have words enough and more then enough in any other argument 
like idols in good things 
that have mouthes 
and speak not 
or as if they were possessed with dumb spirits 
and not suffered to speak any good 
tell such a one of a good farme 
or bargain 
or natural things 
and they savour and relish them well enough 
whereas a good motion strikes them dumb 
and makes them as fishes out of their element

there is more hope of a fool than of him 
but if a man speak necessary things

it cannot be called immoderate or superfluous talk

it must tend to edification 
to feed many

it must bend it self still for god

and the disgrace of sinne 
that word is lost 
which tends to no good purpose 
and better no speech 
than to no end 
he that commands us in all things great and small to seek the glory of god 
will not permit us to speak one word 
which aimes not at some lawfull end 
tends not to some good use and profit 
and yet many in their light and idle speeches say 
why i hope i do no harm 
yea 
but what good doth it 
what profiteth not 
doth harm 
because it is vain and idle 
of which thou canst give no good acccount 
if a fruitless thought be sin 
an unprofitable word much more 
which doth not only turn thy heart from god 
but corrupt 
at least 
hinder others 
from that which is good
q 
what course must a christian take to prevent rash and hasty speeches
a 
first 
he must go to god constantly by prayer 
beseeching him to open his lips 
and to set a watch before the door of his mouth 
secondly 
he must not fail to mourn over his offences in speech 
till he have subdued them 
afflicting himself with voluntary sorrow for them in secret 
thirdly 
he must truss up the loynes of his affections with the girdle of patience and moderation

q 
what are the kinds of lawfull silence
a 
the concealing of truth is either in whole 
or in part 
in whole 
when the speaking of the least word is hurtfull 
as for example 
the father and son are both sick at once 
the son dieth first 
the father asketh whether his son be dead or not 
if it be said no 
an untruth is told 
if yea 
then the fathers grief is encreased 
and his death hastened 
therefore silence is best 
in daies of persecution holy martyrs have chosen rather to suffer death 
then to reveale their brethren 
that have been of their private assemblies with them 
and the rule is general 
that christians are not to reveale their brethren in affliction 
nor to betray them into the hands of persecutors 
nor to be compelled thereunto by oath 
the concealing of a thing in part is 
when a man speaketh a little of the truth 
and concealeth the rest 
which is warranted in all good and lawfull proceedings 
which manifestly tend to the glory of god

enter not into the secrets of the wicked 
but keep close the lawfull secrets of thy friend 
he that goeth about as a tale-bearer discovereth a secret 
but he that is of a faithfull heart 
concealeth a matter 
with him that goeth about as a slanderer 
disclosing a secret 
and with him that flattereth with his lips 
joyn not thy self 
magistrates must conceale things done in the senate 
especially concerning warre 
lest they be revealed to the enemy 
a counsellour is the heart of the prince 
and a part of his body 
and secrecy is the best and safest band of government 
neither can he sustain great matters 
to whom it is grievous to keep silence 
amongst the romans 
in so great a number of senatours 
there was such silence in their court 
that thou wouldst think 
i say not one 
but none to have heard 
what was committed to the ears of many 
let ministers conceale the wants and sinnes that trouble such as are dying 
or that are revealed unto them by the penitent that they might receive comfort and refreshing to their conscience 
4 
the infirmities and sinnes of our neighbour are alwaies to be concealed 
unless it be in case 
that we find our selves called of god to speak 
he that covereth a transgression seeketh love 
if god in mercy cover his sinnes 
why shouldst thou reveale them 
solomon saith 
it is the glory of a man to pass by an infirmity 
more distinctly 
1 
if we be ignorant of the offence we must keep silence 
for he that doth reprehend or correct another 
ought to be certain of the crime 
nor doth it become private men to pry into the actions of others 
that they might find matter to reprehend 
for as we ought to behave our selves in giving alms 
so also in reprehending our brethren 
but in giving alms we are not bound to enquire into certain men 
to whom we might give 
if so be we give to them that need our alms 
we perform our duty 
so also the matter goeth in brotherly correction 
although reprehension be a debt 
yet it is not a private debt which we owe to any certain person 
but publique 
which we owe to all and every one 
which is to be paid as occasion is offered without inquiry into certain men 
2 
secret sinnes known to thee only 
are to be reprehended by thee in secret 
but what thou must do by thy self 
thou must not do by another 
thou must not divulge his sinne 
nor accuse him unto others 
if it cannot be proved otherwise than by thy testimony alone 
he that hath secretly sinned against thee 
correct him secretly 
for if thou only know it 
and thou wilt correct him before others 
thou art not so much a corrector 
as a betrayer 
that of solomon 
open rebuke is better then
secret love 
doth not weaken this rule 
for he doth not understand that rebuke which is before witnesses 
but that private 
whereby a brother is plainly reprehended before his face 
and not in deceit or privily 
not to adde 
that some divines think solomon doth institute comparison betwixt perfidious love and professed hatredcartwr

reprehension is an affirmative duty 
and bindes not to all times 
but to that only 
which in spiritual discretion shall be judged most fit 
both to winne our brother 
and maintain his good name 
than thy own 
for one witness is no witness 
god will not 
that credit be given to the testimony of one only 
nevertheless 
if we be privy to the purpose or intention of men to commit any wickedness against the church 
common-wealth 
or person of our neighbour or such like 
we are wisely and seasonably to detect it 
that it might be prevented 
when pauls sisters sonne heard of the conspiracy of those wicked men 
that had bound themselves by an oath 
neither to eat nor drink till they had killed paul 
he entred into the castle 
and told paul 
and paul sent him not to admonish the conspiratours 
but to inform the centurion 
that by his authority that bloody counsell might be prevented 
mordechai told ester 
and she king ahasuerus of the attempt of bigthan and teresh against the kings person 
3 
if the guilty person do truly repent 
he is not to be reprehended at all 
or at least but lightly 
for the end of admonition is to call back the wanderer into the right way 
if he be already recalled 
there is none or little pace left for reproof 
although the magistrate for the publique good may and ought to correct and punish him 
4 
when reproof may more fitly 
and with greater fruit be deferred till another time 
silence for the present is best 
we must never sooth or incourage men in sinne 
but we may forbear reprehension 
if it be for more profit 
even to watch a better opportunity 
zeal is indiscreet when it will not wait for seasons and occasions 
in many cases we are advised to bear evil men patiently 
and not to break out into a fury 
if at such times as we would 
they cannot break the snares of the devil 
but our patience is to expect 
if at any time god will that they may repent 
and to watch the season that we might profit them by admonition 
many there are that are impatient of evil men 
and drive them away by terrour and despight 
if they be not presently converted 
yet it directly breaks this precept 
and shews that they would be masters and authours of mens salvation 
and not waiters upon god 
that only gives the encrease 
5 
if our hatred against sinne proceed from complexion or disposition of nature 
not from the work of the spirit 
we must first correct our own errour 
before we open our mouthes in rebuke against others 
pity it is to see 
that many mens zeal in religion 
is rather the motion of their irregular corrupt will 
than the powerfull operation of grace 
which is the cause of many sharp 
unseasonable 
hot censures and contentions 
each one contradicting other according to his humour 
and all resisting the motions of the spirit 
therefore every christian must be warned not to compare himself with himself 
nor to measure himself by himself 
for every man is as tall as his own measure 
but he must judge himself to find out the exuberant 
abounding 
reigning complexion 
and that being found 
he must be farre from favouring and defending it in the things of god 
which is the usuall manner of flesh and blood 
but on the contrary 
he must suspect and stop himself in that way to which his inclination over-hurries him 
and condemn his errour when he goes astray 
and having condemned it 
return back into the true way 
now for direction in this case 
it is good to set before our eyes for paterns 
both the words and deeds of men truly sanctified 
or rather the words and deeds of the spirit speaking and living in them 
even such whose unpartiall uprightness hath wholly given them up from the flesh to the spirit 
again 
we must remember that the motions of the spirit are free 
universall 
and uniform 
every saint or sonne of god 
by the
aid of the spirit inwardly freeing him 
and outwardly teaching him 
must strive to have an universall liberty of soul 
free and inclinable to the approving of all truths 
and to the love and practice of all goodness 
this is the great and glorious liberty of the sonnes of god 
and of them alone 
that their souls being lifted up from the hinges of the flesh 
and new fastened to the spirit 
thereby they have a freedom to move whensoever the spirit moves 
and to love whatsoever the spirit loves 
all truths they gladly receive 
all goodness they highly prize and esteem 
this then is the thing that we must look unto in our selves 
before we reprehend what is amiss in our brother 
that our disesteem of sinne be not measured by our disposition and inclination 
but by the truth 
else we shall but strive to correct sinne with sinne 
which is unprofitableamb

and not only so 
but it will be hard to keep moderation 
when we follow the bent of our complexion 
and look more to what is pleasing unto us 
than what should please indeed 
which in admonition is specially to be looked unto 
for the occasion and manner of reproving ofttimes makes the reproof effectual 
and an especiall part of the manner is this 
that it proceed from a visible charity 
splenatick and eager reproofes harden those affections 
which they pretend to soften 
because these reproofes look like a quarrell or revenge 
and not like the incisions of love 
which hurt only 
that they may heal 
surely 
the aim and end of admonitions should be 
the good of the admonished 
and those are most commendable which are most effectual to this end 
and not those which fit most with the humour of the reprover 
moreover 
when contrary complexions meet in contention 
they mutually exasperate each other to be stiffe in their own courses 
for the one rebukes in humour 
not in love 
the other conceits the admonition to proceed from distempered passion 
blind choler 
harshness of constitution 
whereby he is the more hardened in his course 
and stirred up to make opposition against counsell and advice 
6 
if a man know assuredly that his admonition shall be in vain 
or to no good effect 
he is to forbear 
for the end ceasing 
all things tending to that end do cease also 
if therefore no hope of reformation 
which is the end of reproof 
remains 
rebuke it self is to be omitted 
especially if it be found by experience 
that the offender is so farre from amendment 
that he is thereby made the worse 
the more outragious 
he that casteth the seed of wholesome admonitions into such accursed and unfruitfull ground 
shall reape none other reward of his labour 
but the thornes of scorne and contempt 
rebuke not a scorner 
lest he hate thee 
give not that which is holy to dogs 
cast not pearles before swine 
it is small wisdom to contend with a mad man 
if thou want strength to bind him 
5 
all unseemly matters 
all things unknown 
things which concern us not 
things above our reach 
are in silence to be buried

thou art to conceale thine own secrets

5 
in the presence of weak christians we must forbear to dispute of questions and matters of doubt 
that might turn them out of the way 
nor weaken their faith
q 
what other rules are to be observed in lawfull silence
a 
1 
decent silence doth not pre-occupate or snatch an answer 
when another is asked because this is troublesome both to him that asketh and to him that is asked 
to him that asketh the question 
as if he knew not of whom to ask what he would 
to him that is asked 
as if he were not able to satisfie him that asketh
2 
this vertue doth not speedily leap into speech 
but observes diligently the manners and necessity of him that asketh the question 
3 
if it perceive a mind desirous to learn in him that putteth forth the question 
it represseth the answer 
that it may answer considerately 
and the other adde whatsoever he pleaseth 
4 
if any question be to be dispatched 
it circumscribeth the answer by the necessity and him that asketh the questionnon est ejusdem &amp 
multa &amp 
opportune dicere 
but digresseth not upon every small occasion into the rehersall of those things 
which are well known to the relater 
and oftentimes are not unpleasant 
but not fit for the present occasion
q 
is not this silence opposite to ingenuity and boldness of speech

silence and boldness do well agree 
for ingenuity and boldness is a vertue 
whereby we do freely 
without fear 
according as our place 
calling 
time 
occasion 
and necessity requires 
reprehend things to be reprehended 
praise things to be praised 
communicate things to be communicated 
and profess things to be professed 
but this liberty doth notably consent with decent silence 
as no man knoweth how to speak 
but he that can hold his peace 
so none can keep silence as he ought 
but he that is bold to speak as occasion is offered
q 
may a man make use of hope of happiness to encourage him to look well to his tongue
a 
goodness and happiness being linked together 
and wickedness and misery 
the understanding and will more readily imploy and bend themselves to the good 
and from the evil by reason of that union 
and surely 
happiness being tied to goodness by the chain of providence 
we cannot but mend our pace to goodness 
by the sight of annexed happiness 
and it were folly not to look on that which may both delight and incourage us 
our will desires good 
and therefore good being tied to goodness 
gives more appetite to the will 
and surely herein was the same kind of action in the heathens 
though by mistaking 
for these did seek a sovereign good in vertue 
and even for that sought it the more fervently 
now the ods is this 
that we have a sovereign good with vertue 
though not in vertue 
conjoyned but not confounded 
so vertue is lovely to us 
but god the fountain of vertue is farre more lovely 
and to him we walk in the path of vertue 
now there is no baseness in loving vertue well for it self 
neither in loving the authour of vertue better then it 
neither in loving vertue the more for leading us to the authour of vertue

when mn toss his titles in their mouths without any respect or awe of his glorious majesty 
by vain and customary swearing 
and such like asseverations as i will give you my head 
i will adventure my hand 
in common talk 
by hellish blasphemy 
when men use such speeches of god or his works 
as do either detract from his majesty 
or ascribe unto him things unbeseeming 
by perjury or false-swearing 
when men call god to witness a lie 
which is a strange sinne 
for the perjured person doth not only sinne himself 
but withall endeavoureth to intangle god in the same sinne with himself 
in this kind also men sinne 
when they make or recite jests which are contrived out of the phrases of scripture 
the oyl wherewith the tabernacle 
and the arke of the testament 
and the priests were annointed 
was holy 
and therefore no man might put it to any other use 
as to annoint his own flesh therewith 
or to make the like unto it 
and the scoffing of julian the apostat is very fearfull 
who was wont to reach christians boxes on the ear 
and withall bid them turn the other 
and obey their masters commandement 
whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek 
turn to him the other also 
and he denied pay and like reward to his souldiers that were christians 
because he said he would make them fit for the kingdom of heaven 
considering that christ had said 
blessed are the poor in spirit 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 
to pray in sport 
or to make men merry 
is great presumption 
to say 
as some use 
in play 
god send me such a card 
or such a cast 
or i pray god i may winne this or that game 
is too saucy and malapert behaviour for any 
and will not stand with the reverent respect that each one of us oweth to gods majesty 
the rule then is here 
that as we exclude not gods presence in play 
so we call not in his providence to further our play 
oathes are sacred 
prayers are holy 
and the name of god glorious 
yet they must serve the recreation
and man must be delighted 
though god be blasphemed 
a fearfull thing it is 
for man to delight himself in that wherein god is dishonoured 
if there were no other thing but the abuse of gods name 
of sentences of scripture 
and such holy things 
this were enough to make players of this nature 
and such are most 
abhominable to every good christian 
for if thou be a christian 
thou art like unto lot 
and thy righteous soul will be vexed with the dishonour of thy god 
now if thou art vexed therewith 
how canst thou go to be vexed 
canst thou take delight in vexation 
and wilt thou give money for it 
and if thou be not vexed 
then art thou no good christian 
here also men must learn to take heed of all manner of charmes and enchantments 
which commonly are nothing else but words of scripture or such like 
used for the curing of paines and diseases both in men and beasts 
but such practises are devilish 
for the word used in holy manner 
is the instrument of god to convey unto us spiritual blessings 
as faith 
repentance 
sanctification 
but it doth not serve to bring unto us corporall health

the hebrew word rokel properly signifieth a merchant or trafficker up and down with spices or other things 
whereupon rakil 
the word here used 
is a tale-bearer or accuser 
that maketh merchandize as it were of words 
uttering them as wares 
going from place to place 
to hear 
and to spread about criminations of other men 
his property is described to be a revealer of secrets 
his end 
to shed blood 
yet pretending friendship and good neighbourhood 
wherefore the greek translateth it in leviticus 
thou shalt not walk with guile 
and in the proverbs he is called in greek 
double-tongued the holy ghost in the new testament seemeth to call him in greek false accuser 
caluminater 
or make-bate 
and so aquila 
an ancient greek interpreter 
translateth the hebrew word 
and to this the chaldee version agreeth 
saying 
thou shalt not divulge accusations 
or criminations 
among thy people 
which phrase is used in daniel 
of those men which made accusation against daniel 
there translated in greek 
that made accusation 
hereupon the devil hath his name of caluminating and accusing the brethren 
whom the syriak calleth a divulger of accusations or criminations 
they are also called whisperers 
because they privily wound the credit of their neighbour 
and traduce them in secret 
they sow not their calumnies clearly and with a loud voice 
but they do it in corners 
when no witness is present 
this tale-bearing is of divers sorts 
1 
when men whisper abroad secretly the faults of another 
whereas they should rather admonish the party 
as cham when he had seen his fathers nakedness 
ran straight and told his brethren 
for he only is not to be accounted a whisperer that rehearseth things forged of himself or others 
but he that uncovereth things true 
which ought not to be spoken 
or to any other 
than to whom he ought

when they adde to or change the thing said or done 
as it serveth for their purpose 
some of the wtinesses which came against christmat

charged him to say 
i will destroy this temple which is made with hands 
and in three daies build another without hands 
where first they change his meaning 
for christ spake of the temple of his body 
secondly 
they adde to the words 
for christ said not i will destroy this temple 
but destroy ye this temple 
therefore they are noted to be false-witness bearers 
3 
when men surmise 
and tell that upon suspicion or conjecture which was never done 
when jeremy was going out of jerusalem
to the land of benjamin 
irijah took him and said 
thou fliest to the caldeans 
then said jeremy 
that is false 
i fly not to the caldeansjer 
3713 
but he would not hear him 
the fourth is coloured tale-bearing 
when one speaketh evill of another with fine prefaces and preambles 
faining that he is very sorry that his neighbour had done such or such a thing 
that he speaketh it not of malice 
but of a good mind 
that he is constrained to speak 
that he speaketh not all he could speak 
that the party to whom the tale is told must keep it secret 
the fifth is worse then the former 
when men out of envy and il-will 
doe misconstrue the words and actions of men 
and not only take things in the worst part 
but also defame them for well-doing 
thus the pharisees dealtmat

when men forge and devise false accusations to bring the righteous into disgrace

be not rash with thy mouth 
both the mind without knowledge is not good

two vices are here matched together

1813 
it is a folly and shame to him 
to make answer 
or reply to a speech 
or at all to speak of any matter before a man hath throughly heard 
and fully informed himself therein 
is a rash and indiscreet part 
and the evil consequents thereof 
cannot but redound much to his discredit
silence for the most part is a note of wisdom 
a means of safety 
a fool 
saith the philosopher 
cannot hold his peace at a banquet 
but yet silence is sometimes faulty 
as
1 
hypocriticall silence 
when a man continually holdeth his peace 
because he thinketh the worship of god to consist therein 
this was the gross error of the pattolorinctists or silentiaristsdan 
de haer 
lib 
63 
but the scriptures which command moderation of the tongue 
do never impose perpetuall silence 
for by speech as well as by reason man differs from a beast 
and he that takes away the use of speech from amongst men 
doth not only deprive man of many profits pertaining to this life 
but also turn him into a bruit beast 
yea 
into a stock and stone 
and certain it is 
he sinneth against god and that grievously 
who
speaketh not when he ought 
no less then he that speaketh otherwise then he ought
2 
forced silence 
when the adversaries of truth and innocency being overcome with the light that they cannot but discern 
are compelled to keep silence 
as it is said of the spies 
that were sent forth of the scribes and pharisees to entangle our saviour christ 
when they heard his answersmar

they marvelled at him 
and held their peace
3 
wicked and unseasonable silence 
when men hold their peace being called of god 
and having opportunity to speak 
first 
thus it is unlawfull to keep silence 
when the glory of god requireth that we speak 
out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained praise 
psal

if these should hold their peace

it belongeth to the ministers of the gospel with boldness to publish the message that god hath put into their mouthes 
notwithstanding the world fret and rage against it 
sonne of man

and speak with my words unto them 
ezek

ezek

as the preachers of the gospel must publish the glad tidings of salvation 
so must christians make profession of the faith and true religion 
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness 
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation 
rom

secondly 
we must not hold our peace when the safety of the innocent requireth that we speak 
open thy mouth for the dumb 
in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction

that is 
speak in the behalf of the oppressed

or dare not plead for themselves 
may well be called dumb and yet have an equall

rescue by thy power such as being innocent are brought into the danger of death or undoing 
or whosoever thou art 
by all lawfull means seek the deliverance of them that without cause be drawn into danger 
for if any be justly troubled 
or condemned to die 
it belongeth not to us to meddle with him 
otherwise then by praying for him 
or inciting him to repentance 
but if might oppress right 
or violence be offered to the poor afflicted 
every one is bound to defend his neighbour 
as much as in him lyeth 
governours must minister help to the oppressed by vertue of their authority 
inferiours by giving counsell 
or testifying the truth of the cause 
or in petitioning to the prince 
or such as have power of delivering 
as ebedmelech for jeremiah 
and ester for her people 
or by prayer to god in their behalf 
as the church in the time of the apostles for peter 
and in the time of the prophets 
for other godly men who were destinated to the slaughter 
thirdly 
in publique scandals 
when we are called forth to bear witness 
we must testifie our knowledge 
prov

if any soul hear the voice of swearing 
and is a witness

causeth men to incurre the recompence that is due to other mens offences 
as themselves by bearing with them 
and winking at them 
have intangled themselves with the guiltiness thereof 
and so made themselves obnoxious unto them 
fourthly 
if we be privy to any secret offence wherein our
neighbour liveth 
we are to admonish him in private 
if thy brother shall trespass against thee 
go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone

sixthly 
if we know harm to be intended against our neighbour 
we are bound to reveale it wisely 
that the mischief might be prevented 
thus johanan the sonne of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields 
came to gedaliah to mizpahjer 
4013 
14 
and said unto him 
doest thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the sonne of nethaniah to slay thee 
but this must be done seasonably 
that the evil might be avoided 
and wisely 
that we entangle not our selves in trouble 
seventhly 
in open and notorious cases 
if we our selves be not fit to admonish and rebuke 
we must informe others who may be physicians to the party delinquent 
and minister unto him for the cure of the soul 
as the house of cloe informed paul of the dissentions that were in the church of corinth1 cor 
111 
that by his authority he might seek redress
4 
sullen and passionate silence is to be condemned 
when men refuse to salute their enemies courteously 
or out of stubbornness will scarce vouchsafe a quiet 
free 
gentle answer to their superiours 
equals 
companions 
when they are crossed 
vexed 
disquieted 
if the heart swell so big 
as to stop the free passage and current of the tongue in fitting speech 
it is farre too great to be good 
dogged silence is as much displeasing 
as farre unbeseeming 
as stubborn and saucy answering again
5 
silence proceeding from want of delight in heavenly things or love to the glory of god 
is vitious and to be condemned 
all thy works shall praise thee 
o lord 
and thy saints shall bless thee 
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom 
and talk of thy power 
to make known unto the sonnes of men his mighty acts 
and the glorious majesty of his kingdom 
psal

my lips shall utter praise 
when thou hast taught me thy statutes 
psal 
119171 
172
6 
silence is then faulty 
when shame and fear of reproach drives men to keep silence from good words 
we must neither expose religion to contempt through unadvised speech 
nor refrain altogether from good words 
left we should be mocked 
princes did sit and speak against me 
but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes 
psal 
11923 
i will speak of thy word before kings 
and will not be ashamed 
psal 
11946 
this faulty silence is a great offence 
first 
for that it robbeth god of his glory 
which is the highest sacriledgemat 
1237 
secondly 
if men shall be justified by their words 
how shall they stand before gods tribunall of grace 
who have continually
kept from holy words 
thirdly 
the saints are commanded to exhort 
admonish 
rebuke 
comfort 
and build up one another in their most holy faith 
but they cannot yeeld obedience to this commandement 
if they give way to continuall silence 
fourthly 
it is the commendation of them that fear god 
that they speak often one to another 
mal 
316
the use of all is 
that we seriously humble our selves for the errrour of our tongues 
take sorrow for it 
and heartily pray for pardon and grace to reform and amend 
woe is me 
for i am undone 
because i am a man of unclean lips 
and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips 
isa 
65 
and this transgression is the rather to be watched against 
because we have many provocations to sinne in this kind 
and though the offence may seem less 
yet oft failings may increase the measure of it

it is a religious calling upon god in the name of christ according to his will 
or we may call it 
an humble and familiar conference of the faithfull soul with the lord his redeemer 
in jesus christ 
for prayer is an opening of the heart to god 
in making requests and offering thanks through christ 
a desire no way expressed in thought or word 
is not prayer 
but the motion of the soul in desire or thanksgiving 
lifting up it self to god 
in scripture it is called 
the lifting up of 
or the rearing up of the soul 
and they that pray 
are said to pour out their souls or hearts before god 
to intreat the face of the lord god 
to seek the face of god 
to pour out their complaint before him 
to lift up a prayer 
to pour out a prayer 
and to lift up a cry
to desire is not to pray 
but sheweth what we approve

are not all wishes and desires prayers
a 
every desire is not by and by prayer 
albeit every prayer 
thanksgiving excepted 
ordinarily imports some desire 
neither is every lawfull desire a fit matter for prayer 
for prayer is a wish or desire of the heart directed unto god 
but many things we desire and may lawfully desire 
which yet are not matters of that moment as may be fit to acquaint god in particular with our desire of them 
or to direct our petitions in special manner to him for them 
much less to expect or require at gods hand any special work or help of his for
the effecting of them 
thus in lawfull game a man may desire to winne rather then to lose 
to overcome rather then to be conquered 
but they are not such as it is seemly to acquaint god withall

for desire to pray is not bred in us by nature 
nor acquired by humane study or industry 
but put into us by the spirit of god 
who doth lift up our hearts to god 
wherefore in special manner it is called the spirit of supplications 
because by this heavenly fire 
our affections are warmed with a desire of praying 
and our lips are opened to sing of the praise of god 
prayer is not a work of humane strength 
art 
wit or learning 
for we of our selves know not what to pray 
the child is born before it cry 
faith and prayer are both from one fountain 
but faith is a supernaturall gift of god 
the same spirit that infuseth the gift of faith 
doth teach 
incite 
direct 
and inable to pray 
as every man hath more liberally received the graces of the spirit 
so is he more ardent and frequent in prayers 
as soon as the holy ghost doth possess the heart of man 
he doth cast into it an ardent fire of prayer 
whose flames do mount up to the habitations of god 
the less principal efficient is the faithfull heart 
prayer is the gift of god 
but the act of man 
the spirit giveth ability to pray 
and inciteth unto it 
but it is man that prayeth by the spirit 
a godly mind and fervent heart 
that is 
an understanding holily informed 
and a will moved with fervent zeal to perform this worship religiously and after a lawfull manner 
is the less principal cause of prayer
q 
by prayer we obtain the spirit 
how is he then the cause of prayer
a 
the spirit of god is the parent of prayer 
but the more full communication of the spirit is obtained by prayer 
as hath been shewed before
q 
is prayer any part of gods worship
a 
it is a principal part of divine service 
which god requireth 
and man is bound to perform 
for first 
when god is delighted with nothing so much as with our obedience 
he hath most severely enjoyned this office of prayerhos

secondly 
sith on god as the most high all inferiour causes in the world are dependent 
and the higher any cause is 
the more it coveteth to impart vertue unto things beneath it 
how should any kind of service we do or can do 
find greater acceptance then prayer 
which sheweth our concurrence with him in desiring that wherewith his very nature doth most delight 
thirdly 
the name of prayer is usuall to signifie even all the service that ever we do unto god 
and that perhaps to shew 
that there is in religion no acceptable duty 
which devout invocation of the name of god doth not either presuppose or inferre 
fourthly 
prayers are those calves of mens lips 
those most gracious and sweet odours 
those rich presents and gifts which being carried up into heaven 
do best testifie our dutifull affection 
and are for the purchasing of all favour at the hands of god 
the most undoubted means we can use 
fifthly 
prayer is compared to incense or sweet perfumes 
for that they are as acceptable to the lord as perfumes are to men 
and to the drops of honey 
as it were dropping from the lips of the church 
as from a honycombe 
milk and hony are under her tongue 
sixthly 
by prayer we glorifie god 
acknowledging him to be the father of lights 
the fountain of all good we have and would have 
giving him the praise of his wisdom 
goodness 
mercy 
and power 
as who knoweth our necessities 
and is both willing and able
to help and succour us 
as teaching bringeth us to know that god is our supream truth 
so prayer testifieth that we acknowledge him our sovereign good

if parents sinfull 
give good things to their children that ask them 
will much more give us the spirit that desire it 
spare to speak 
and spare to speed 
open thy mouth wide 
and god will fill it 
the grace of god is the fountain of all blessings 
but gods hearing and our prayers 
as means do come betwixt the grace of god which is hidden in himself 
and the effects of his grace 
which are then perceived 
when he heareth our prayers 
and of this ordinance there are just reasons 
1 
it is meet we should pray for the things we have need of 
that having received them 
we might be assured we had them of god 
and not by accident or fortune 
as natural men speak 
2 
god that bestoweth his gifts of grace freely 
would have it appear that they are gratious 
given without any desert 
and this is done 
when we beg to be relieved of meer mercy 
and praise the lord for favours already vouchsafed of bounty and love 
3 
what love or honour 
should god receive at our hands for mercies given 
if we did not call upon him in our necessities 
and praise his name for the love wherewith he hath respected us 
the commanded necessary use of prayer is three-fold 
first 
in respect of god 
who is glorified by our prayer and praise 
as the wellspring of grace 
the fountain of mercy 
the giver of every good and perfect gift 
from whom they come 
and to whom all praise must be returned 
by prayer 
the graces of the spirit are exercised 
and so increased 
we have communion with god 
and grow into acquaintance with god 
whereby our stock of grace and comfort is much augmented 
good company increaseth grace 
communion with god much more 
secondly 
in regard of men 
the helping of them through love 
by being suiters at the throne of grace for them through christ 
and returning thanks with and for them unto the lord 
thirdly 
in regard of our selves 
that we might obtain what is needfull 
prevent what evil might befall 
testifie the holiness of our desires before him 
and pay our debt of thankfullness 
having nothing else to return for all his mercies plentifully reached forth unto us 
and that use and experience might confirm the providence of god unto us

prayer is as a key to open the storehouses of all gods treasures unto us 
as by knocking we enter into the place we desire to go to 
so by prayer we obtain those things we need 
prayer is as a hook to reach those things that are above our reach 
and to put by those things that stand in our way 
if we pray not 
we cannot hope to be supplied in our necessities 
nor yet comfortably to use and enjoy the things we have 
for as if we take any thing that is our neighbours without asking him leave 
we are accounted thieves 
so to possess the things of god 
whose all things are 
without asking them at his hand 
is felony 
prayers are means to prepare us holily and comfortably to enjoy the things received 
the creature is sanctified by prayer 
and what we obtain by prayer 
we possess with greatest pleasure 
things received by prayer encrease our love to god 
our fervency in supplication 
our faith in his promises 
our thankfulness to his majesty

signifieth not only to crave

the disciples should not need to question as they had done before

this sense is manifest by the textjoh

hence we read that often he departed into a private place to pray 
that he went up into the mountain to pray 
he would not touch a bit of bread without blessing and giving thanks 
he prayed at his baptisme 
transfiguration 
in the garden 
at his death 
it were infinite to name the saints of god 
that alone and with others 
in peace and trouble 
have sought the lord by hearty prayer 
not to stand upon particular instances 
the practice is so general 
that to be a christian 
and to call upon the name of the lord 
is in substance one thing 
ananias saith 
paul had authority to bind all that call on the name of the lord 
thus paul describeth the saints 
they call upon the name of jesus christ out of a pure heart 
when babes are born 
they say 
they cry presently 
but when men are converted and made new creatures by the work of the spirit 
they presently cry 
the thief upon the cross prayed 
when he was brought to repentance 
manasses when he sought the lord 
humbled himself greatly and prayed 
paul began newness of life with supplication 
it is the note of an atheist 
that he calleth not upon god 
of an hypocrite 
that he prayeth in some conditions only 
of a sound christian 
that he will alwaies call upon god 
prayer is the first thing wherewith a righteous life beginneth 
and the last wherewith it doth end 
for prayer is the breath of faith 
and as we believe 
so we pray 
a temporary faith bringeth forth temporary prayer 
sound faith 
unfeigned constant prayer 
if faith languish 
prayer is feeble 
when faith reviveth 
prayer is lively and working 2 
a second motive is 
the sweet and comfortable promises made to them that make known their requests unto god with supplication and thanksgiving 
call upon me 
and i will hear thee 
open thy mouth wide 
and i will fill it 
who is so dull 
that is not quickned by these gracious allurements 
so stubborn as not to be wonne 
so timerous 
as not to be encouraged by them 
who will not ask 
when his request is so graciously acceptedpsal

having such an high priest 
who is set over the house of god 
let us draw near with a true heart 
having such a friend in the court of that authority and esteem 
who will not ply the throne with petitions early and late 
specially when we seek unto him that hath pleasure in our supplications 
7 
the effects and benefits of prayer 
should put heart and courage into us 
it is not a dead work that brings no profit with it 
but most gainfull and commodious 
by prayer 
we obtain pardon of sinnes 
put satan to flight 
winne the day of enemies 
spiritual and corporal 
without striking a stroke 
escape the calamities that shall come upon the world 
it doth get us supply of strength if we come to the encounter 
look how captains fighting abroad for their countries 
send their letters 
and so have men 
munition 
victuals 
money 
&ampc 
so prayer is the messenger of a faithfull soul 
and fetcheth every thing from god 
prayer doth strengthen us in faith and hope 
for look as if we commune often and familiarly with a man 
we have more confidence towards him 
so if we by often prayer speak with our god 
it doth imbolden us 
and breed more liberty and confidence towards him 
than if we were estranged 
let us pray 
and god will give the spirit to lead us into all truth and holiness 
to support and strengthen in all tryals 
to enable to all duties of piety or mercy 
pray 
and the peace of god shall like a watch-tower keep our hearts prayer getteth all our other armour fitted about us 
we being not able to buckle it on 
further than our heavenly father doth help us on with it 
prayer hath opened the windows of heaven 
stopped the mouth of the lyon 
quenched the force of fire 
loosed iron bands 
and cast out devils 
it is a notable means for the strengthening of our faith and affiance 
for the inflaming of our hearts with love 
it increaseth our cummunion and fellowship with god 
and maketh our minds to soare aloft in heavenly meditations 
it assures us that we are the children of god 
and heires of the heavenly inheritance 
in a word 
he can want nothing that is good 
no evil can come nigh his dwelling that doth sincerely call upon the lord 
ask 
and have in abundance
q 
god will do that which shall seem good unto him 
neither can his will be altered by my prayers
a 
but it must be remembred 
that god 
before he granteth any good thing unto his elect 
is wont usually to kindle their minds with an exceeding desire to obtin those things 
further 
when he will do any thing 
he stirreth up those that are his 
to desire that 
which otherwise he would have done 
to the intent
that for honour sake 
he might attribute the same unto their prayers 
this also is another cause 
for that gods benefits are then the more acceptable 
when they are craved and desired 
moreover 
in praying our minds are more joyned unto god 
yea 
and those vows and holy desires seem to be nothing else 
but ladders and degrees whereby we ascend up unto god 
and certain waies and spaces 
whereby we come to that which we earnestly desire 
finally 
we pray not in any case to the intent we may change god 
which thing we should attempt in vain 
seeing he is immutable 
but rather 
that we our selves should be changed 
for so much as in praying we are made capable of the benefits of god 
a faithfull and spiritual prayer puts the heart in a better disposition 
so that a man is now made ready to receive a blessing 
which before he was not 
so that when we think we draw god nearer by our arguments 
indeed we draw nearer unto him

prayers do not alwaies speed 
therefore they seem to be in vain 
for this i besought the lord thrice 
saith paul 
yet he missed of that he sought 
much more we in temporall things
a 
that is not in vain 
which doth not alwaies presently get the thing we would have 
aboue which we must learn these things 
first 
that prayer doth often obtain what we would have 
as moses prayed for victory 
and had it 
hannah for a sonne 
and had him 
secondly 
when it doth not obtain the things themselves 
it gets something 
that may be worth the seeking as though it doth not quite remove evils 
yet it prevails so farre 
as to have mercy mingled with judgments 
our evils asswaged 
though we get not the things we wish2 cor 
127 
8 
it getteth some grace proportionable 
as in paul 
my grace is sufficient for thee 
thirdly 
though it get not deliverance according to desire 
yet it alwaies procures issue for salvation 
fourthly 
we must not alwayes expect 
that god should straightway answer our petitions 
and if he shall defer them 
we must thus comfort our selves 
he hath not yet fulfilled our requests 
howbeit he will do the same in due time 
in the mean while he will after this manner exercise our faith 
it is not seldome 
that god seemeth he would nothing less 
then what he hath promised and threatned 
he promised the kingdome to david 
but with what miseries did he exercise him before he fulfilled his promises 
when our lord and saviour jesus christ was to be born of the virgin mary 
the angel promised that he should have the throne of his father david 
and yet until the thirty year of his age 
he lived in small shew of the world 
after that he was envied of the high priests 
pharisees and scribesisa 
2816 
heb 
1036 
and at the last hanged upon a tree 
therefore esay doth very well admonish 
that he which believeth 
must not be hasty 
for god will performe in due time those things which he hath promised 
but in the mean time our part is to prescribe nothing unto him 
the very same thing also must we say of the threatnings 
god said 
that he would overthrow the babylonians 
yet did they flourish and triumph 
yea and led the people into captivity 
wherefore god would not fulfill his threatnings presently 
yet did he performe them when he saw a time convenient
q 
what if my heart tell me 
that god will not hear my prayers 
or i feel inwadly such an answer
judg 
1013a 
yet must we not cease to pray 
but stirre up our faith to believe 
sharpen our desires 
and encrease our repentance 
the lord saith 
he will not be an help to the israelites 
not that he might drive them from him 
but awaken them to a more serious consideration of their waies 
and desire of mercy

24 suffer that my wrath may be kindled 
and i will destroy them at once 
this he said to inflame moses desire in behalf of the people 
and to set  edge on his prayers 
not that he determined to destroy them 
the woman of chanaan cryed unto christ 
but he passed by in silence 
as though he heard
her not 
afterward 
she being instant in prayer 
he said 
i am not sent 
but unto the lost sheepe of the house of israel 
and when as she ceased not 
he called her dog 
and yet he was minded to help her 
but first he would have her faith to come to light 
and in another place 
under the parable of him that asked bread 
he saith 
unto whom the good man of the house that was within 
saidluk 
117 
i and my children be laid in bed 
and when the other had made earnest suite 
by his importunity 
he obtaineth as many leaves as he would 
wherefore if our heart accuse us 
let us convert our selves unto christ 
and stirre up our selves more confidently to seek for mercy in his name 
this is that which god approveth
q 
i have asked long and not received 
wherefore i fear it is in vain to pray
a

we must examine whether our continuing in some lust 
do not hinder the effect of our prayer

and this may be known by the effect how these things are spent 
and then if we amend our prayers 
god will amend our speeding 
secondly 
we must know that god doth deferre us 
to try how we will persevere in prayer 
as a friend when he meaneth to do this or that 
doth detract it at the first 
to see if the other will importune him 
thirdly 
he doth not forthwith bestow what we crave 
that we might know the worth of things 
and have our joy doubled in receiving them 
fourthly 
it is a token god will give us more abundantly 
the longer he doth hold us in request 
the wider one openeth any thing 
it is a token he meaneth to put the more in 
god intendeth not our hinderance 
in causing us to wait 
nor purposeth to weary us 
by putting delaies 
it is not in vain therefore to ask 
though we be not presently answered

files up our prayers 
putting them on record before himmal

to stay in this case is dangerous 
for the heart growes more hard by continuance

the devil will labour to prevent us 
or break us off in this duty by distractions 
this thing 
and that thing calling us away
a 
we must be resolute against distractionsmat

first seek the kingdom of heaven 
if we promise at this or that houre to meet a man 
when the clock smiteth 
whosoever we are with 
we crave pardon 
we are to go 
make not more bold with god then you would with man 
is it not better to lose some sleep 
or to cut short the time of daily repast 
than to deprive our souls of communion with god in that holy duty 
what shift will men make to spare some time for conference with a godly kind friend 
now to redeem time for prayer 
we must learn to be diligent in our callings 
and go about our labours with heavenly-mindedness 
spending no needless houres in thinking or speaking of earthly things 
out of carnal affection that we bear unto them 
he that takes no more work in hand then god allowes 
is wise to order his affairs with discretion 
delights not to think or speak of earthly businesses superfluously 
and with diligence observe he season that offers it self for the dispatch of his work 
he 
if he will contend and wrestle against difficulties 
shall find convenient time for prayer
q 
such mists of darkness 
such swarmes of wandering idle thoughts come before our minds 
that we are much discomforted
a 
it is no doubt a great fault 
and exceeding hindrance of christian comfort 
that the heart is wandering after vanity when it should be attent upon god 
we cannot endure our children should look up and down 
here and there 
when they speak unto us 
and is it not a misery and sinne 
that we should carry our selves more rudely in the presence of god 
then we would or durst in civil converse with men 
but for the thing it self 
first 
we must enquire whether letting loose our hearts all day 
do not cause this unfitness at night 
and if it be so 
we must help the matter with watchfulness 
if vanity possess the mind at our first awaking in the morning 
and we suffer the heart to rove about idly all day long 
and grow into distemper and earthly-mindedness 
it will hardly be brought to attend upon god in the duty of prayer and thanksgiving 
a trifling fellow that wanders up and down 
will not easily be tied to any sore work 
it is death to the soul 
after our roving fits 
to be kept to any supernaturall work that is above it self 
but daily custome makes that easie 
which at first was tedious 
if the heart be held to what is good 
and kept within compass at all times 
it will readily attend upon god in the time of prayer 
the best way to prevent roving 
is to keep our heart in tune and rightly disposed 
as when a man is to use his horse 
he will have him under bridle 
it is good to meditate on that glorious presence before whom we stand 
the necessity 
profit 
and excellency of those gifts and graces we beg of god in prayer 
secondly 
we must know that the saints have felt both these things 
darkness and wandrings 
for there is a double wandering of the mind 
one of carelesness 
negligence 
and contempt 
when we intend not holy dutyes 
come not unto them with carefulness 
such as is in many in the church 
that pray and their minds are a wooll-gathering 
they say 
amen 
but know not to what 
there is another wandering of the mind 
which is through infirmity and temptation of satan 
as a man that aims at a mark 
may have a shaking hand 
or be jogged by another 
that he cannot shoot streight 
now this being felt 
is grievous unto us 
though we cannot overcome it 
thirdly 
this is a rule 
we must not cease to do any commandement 
because of our imperfection in doing it 
the frailties that cleave unto us must be striven against with all diligence 
but the duty it self is not to be forborn

a 
there is a reigning unbelief 
and there is a doubting 
or unbelief 
which
is a weakness left in the saints 
for their exercise 
the first is in heathens and unbelievers 
the latter which is a doubting which is in the soul that would be rid of it 
and fights against it by prayer of faith 
this doth not hinder us from being heardmat

but if thou canst do any thing 
help us 
oh thou of little faith 
wherefore didst thou doubt 
i said in my haste i am clean cast off 
nevertheless thou heardst my prayer 
if faith be weak 
we must not cease to pray 
but pray the more that we might be confirmed 
for by earnest prayer we come to be assured of gods favour 
and faith by asking obtaineth what she doth desire 
yea 
say a man were destitute of that faith that justifieth 
he is allowed and bound to seek it of god by earnest prayer 
which is not altogether unacceptable 
because it proceedeth from a faith that stirreth up desire of firm union and communion with christ 
as for the place alledged 
by wavering or doubting 
hypocriticall halting or division of heart 
not doubting of gods mercy towards us by reason of our sin 
or weakness of faith 
seemeth to be understood
q 
i am kept under with dulness and dead-heartedness 
that i am afraid to pray
a 
there is a two-fold dulness 
one of feebleness 
which is accompanied with the abjectness of the heart 
when the spirits are wasted with labour and sorrow 
the other of sloth joyned with presumption 
both must be striven against 
but are not alike dangerous 
nor to be remedied after one manner 
if dulness arise from feebleness and wasting of the spirits 
we must bring our selves into the sunne-shine of gods love 
and cheer up our souls with the remembrance of his free mercies 
gracious promises and tender compassions 
for the straightned spirit is reived with comfort 
as joynts benummed with cold gather strength when they receive warmth 
the best way to fit our selves for this duty 
is to fall presently to the duty 
and the very doing of the duty doth fit to the duty 
as all actions of the same kind increase the habits 
so prayer 
makes us fit for prayer 
the way to godliness 
is in the compass of godliness 
the way to grow in grace 
is the exercise of grace 
by setting himself upon the work 
he shall gather fitness 
though he were unfit at the first 
as joynts benummed 
get life 
being used 
if dulness proceed from the other extream 
we must stirre up our spirits by calling to mind the charge that god hath laid upon us to pray 
the threatnings denounced against them that neglect or contemn it 
the judgments executed upon them that have not called upon the name of god 
we must also meditate 
what brands of disgrace are fastened upon them that deal sluggishly in the service of god 
what benefits they are justly deprived of by their own folly 
and what indignity they offer to the lord himself 
further 
we must make our sloth odious 
and shame our selves that we should deal with a slack hand in a matter of so high and excellent nature 
whereby we might have reaped much profit and comfort to our souls 
and having thus wrestled with our selves to shake off such chilness as we have caught by idleness 
we must cry to him that is the quickning spirit 
not being quiet till we get some warmth into our spirits 
thus dulness is to be driven away by prayer 
and earnest contention 
but we must not cease to pray because we are dull 
notwithstanding any dulness of spirit 
the duty is to be performed 
we have never more need to pray 
then when we are most indisposed 
for then a man is exposed to temptation 
apt to be overcome 
fit for nothing 
again 
all dulness doth not hinder the success of our prayers 
but that which is allowed 
delighted in 
or not striven against 
as hath been mentioned 
if thou spare no labour to get thy heart upon the wing 
and do it as well as thou canst 
it shall be accepted
q 
by what arguments or considerations should a man further strengthen himself 
that he may constantly carry forth this duty
a 
first 
if we might be familiarly admitted to the kings presence 
we would easily accept it 
in faithfull prayer thou maist commune with god 
secondly 
how worthy are we to miss good things 
that will not open our mouths for what we lack 
nor return thanks for what is freely given 
when god bids us ask and have 
how unthankfull and unworthy wretches are we 
that neglect such kindness 
and will not prove him that is so gracious 
when thankfulness for what is received 
is crowned with second favours 
how injurious are we to our selves 
unmindfull of god 
if we look not to him the giver of every good and perfect gift 
thirdly 
there is no duty so acceptable to god 
for that god being the chief good 
and so ready to communicate hi blessings 
we in prayer desire what he specially delighteth in 
and furthermore 
prayer is to grace 
as pouning is to sweet spices 
it maketh grace 
as faith 
love 
reverence

and if we lay it downjob 357 
we shall have the loss of it

what givest thou unto him

we must be so farre from being offended at gods not answering 
at our own want of comfort and liberty 
that we must hold 
even this1 chro

that we are allowed to speak unto god 
such a priviledge as we are unworthy of

the more freedom and strength thou shalt have in performing thy duty

teacheth to deny

and that in good earnest

chap 
iii 
shewing that liberty to pray is a singular and rare priviledge
question 
let us now hear in what respects liberty to pray is a singular and rare priviledge
a 
1 
it is no small favour that the creature is allowed to commune with his creatour 
the redeemed with his saviour 
it is a liberty purchased by the blood of christ 
men are glad of a faithfull friend 
into whose bosome they might poure out their cares 
with whom they might sweetly conferre upon occasion 
oh 
what cause have we to rejoyce in this 
that the lord vouchsafeth us leave to talk with him 
who of all friends is the most faithfull and constant 
we cannot pierce the secrets of mans heart 
they are unsearchable 
but we know the mind of god 
that he is more loving 
than love it self 
more faithfull 
than faith it self 
friends often lack wisdom to consider of our case 
mercy to compassionate 
power to help 
judgment to weigh it 
specially when we are not able to lay it open 
and faithfulness to keep in mind or conceal what is committed to their trust 
all which things diminish the comfort of their love and fellowship 
but our god is most infinite in wisdom 
rich in mercy 
great in power 
most ready to help 
able to succour 
exactly knowing our distress 
our strength 
when help is meet 
what aid is fit 
and what is good for us better than we our selves 
2 
other duties have their season 
but prayer is never out of season 
men cannot alwaies hear the word 
read the scriptures 
give almes 
they want ability and opportunity to these purposes 
but prayer may be used at any time 
night or day 
in any place 
upon any occasion 
nothing being required thereunto but lifting up of the heart unto godrom

alone or in company 
at home or abroad

this liberty is the greater 
because perpetuall 
at all times 
and in every moment of time 
distance of place may hinder the communion of friends by speech or writing 
necessary occasions and infirmities may interrupt it when they live together 
that when the one needs 
the other cannot afford his presence 
or the comfort of it 
but god is every where present 
alwaies ready to be found if we seek unto him 
a man may be driven into banishment 
shut up close prisoner that no friend can have access unto him 
the enemies may pluck out his eyes 
that he shall not read 
cut out his tongue 
that he shall not speak 
deprive him of the benefit of hearing the word 
and assembly of the saints 
but liberty to pray can no man take from them 
in banishment 
imprisonment 
trouble 
they may cry unto god 
and he will hear them 
the malice of men may drive christians with more speed and earnestness to cry unto the lord 
and him to send aid and help from above 
but to hinder their prayers for one moment 
or to withhold succour from them 
they are not able 
4 
we cannot enjoy the presence and comfort of friends without travell and cost 
and sometimes they are so distempered with passions 
that they cannot or will not vouchsafe that contentment which we expect and stand in need of 
but in any distress we may go unto god without any trouble 
it requires not motion of the body 
but sending up the thoughts 
which may be done in an instant 
and coming to him 
we shall ever find what we desire 
he will never turn from us 
if we depart not from his testimonies 
in the society of our best friends many things may fall out on their behalf 
that minister occasion of grief 
but with the lord nothing is to be found 
which offers not abundant matter of joy and comfort
5 
the knowledge is small which we have on earth 
concerning things that are done in heaven 
notwithstanding 
thus much we know even of the angels in heaven 
that they praise the lord 
and therefore prayer being a work common unto men with angels 
what should we think but that so much of our lives is celestial and divine as we spend in the exercise of prayer 
for which cause we see that the most comfortable visitations 
which god hath sent men from above 
have taken especially the times of prayer as their most natural opportunitiesdan

there is no doubt 
but that he should become the better

surely the more we commune with him by prayer 
the liker shall we be unto him in holiness and righteousness

on others 
what more easie 
and yet what more fruitfully bestowed then our prayers 
if we give counsell 
they are the simpler only that need it 
if almes 
the poorer only are relieved 
but by prayer we do good to all 
when we are not able to do any other thing for mans behoof 
when through maliciousness or unkindness they vouchsafe not to accept any other good at our hands 
prayer is that which we alwaies have in our power to bestow 
and they never in theirs to refuse

he that can and doth pray 
is a man of singular respect 
honour and authority

he is held to be the greatest favourite 
that is most familiar with the prince 
how great is that man 
who is in familiarity with the king of kings 
that lawyer is in most request 
who is most inward with the chief judg of the court 
doth not he deserve esteem with men 
that is in account with god 
who is the absolute and supream judg of the whole world 
2 
in christ jesus he is made a spiritual priest to offer up the well-pleasing sacrifice of supplication and thanksgiving 
which is no small dignity 
if things be weighed according to their worth

if men be to preferre a petition to the high court of parliament 
the prince or supream governour

ambassadours 
or such like 
how excellent are his gifts who can draw petitions 
frame meditations acceptable to god 
pleasing to the highest majesty

in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving 
let your request be made known unto god

and the father 
in the name of our lord jesus christ 
look as nature teacheth our children to come to their parents for every thing 
and to give thanks to them 
not to servants in house with them 
so grace teacheth gods children to cry abba father 
to resort to him in all necessity 
and return praise to him for every blessing 
all other persons 
are persons rather praying to god 
then persons to be prayed to 
as god 
god is the authour of every good gift 
to seek it religiously of any other is flat idolatry 
and to give the praise thereof to any but the lord 
is sacriledge 
look as it is one of the royalties of the king 
to be petitioned unto 
as a common parent for grace in sundry cases 
so this is a divine royalty of god 
that all flesh should come to him in their severall necessities 
abasing themselves in confessing their indigency 
exalting him as with whom is fulness of good things 
and uncontrolable power to effect for us whatever is good according to his own pleasure 
and as he is to be sought unto for supply of our wants 
so to be magnified for his mercies freely vouchsafed 
now we must come to god only through christ 
for he is our only mediatour 
the great master of all requests which are any way made to god 
and presenter of all praises that are offered to his highness 
neither can mediatour like authority be given to any angel or saint departed 
for they are not called to this honour 
neither are they capable of it 
as unable to perform that satisfactory obedience 
in which as a foundation the impetrative force of christs intercession leaneth 
for all kind of power to impetrate all ministeriall offices about us 
all power of secondary executing things for us 
all perfection of holiness 
which things are for degree in saints living 
cannot be foundations which may bear this office of mediation twixt us and god

a 
it is a work of the inner man

in all our service we should say with the apostle 
that we serve god with our spirits 
but chiefly in prayer 
it being not the warbling of the words

after god

and the caveat is 
let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before god 
the wicked are challenged 
that they pray not with their heart 
when thy houle upon their beds 
the prayer outward 
of the lips 
without the request of the heart 
is an empty thing which god regardeth not 
nay 
an abhominable mockery 
which he detesteth 
cursed is he that draweth near with his lips 
when his heart is farre from me 
the spirit is the true rise of prayer 
it is the travell of the heart which pleaseth god 
singing with grace in your hearts to the lord 
making melody in your heart to the lord 
my heart is fixed 
saith david 
my heart is fixed 
i will sing 
and give praise 
and so he calleth upon himself 
bless the lord 
o my soul 
and all that is within me bless his holy name 
again 
intreating audience 
he sath 
give ear unto my prayer that proceedeth not from feigned lips 
for god is a spirit 
and will be worshipped in spirit and truth 
the cry of the lips doth not pierce the clouds 
but the sighes of the heart enter into the ears of the lord of hosts 
who dwelleth in the heavens 
and this maketh prayer laborious 
because the spirit is to travell in it 
and the saints in this regard 
can endure better to hear an houre 
than to pray a quarter 
whereas the world 
they cry for praying rather than for preaching 
because they think the outward repeating of words with a general intention will suffice 
not knowing or considering in truth what it is to pray or hear
q 
what direction may we take from hence touching the length of our prayers
a 
prayer is an exercise of the souleccl 
52 
to be continued according to the strength of livelihood and spirit that god hath given 
the rule of direction is 
that we must fit and proportion our words to our matter 
and both matter and words to our minds and hearts 
our faith and fervency 
devotion and attention 
in this holy duty it is not good ordinarily to exceed to tiredness 
which breedeth both deadness and discomfort 
if dulness proceed from sloth 
it is necessary to wrestle 
till it be overcome 
but if thou have life and power 
it is dangerous to out-spend natural ability 
for when the spirits are wasted 
our desires will cool 
and dulness creep on 
which doth not a little disquiet the tender conscience 
in publique prayer 
the minister in respect of length must have regard to the ability of the congregation 
in prayer with the family 
the master may continue so long 
as the power and strength of them that live therein 
will bear 
they that pray with others 
must have regard to the vigour and livelihood of them that joyn with them 
the prayers of the sick and feeble should be short and frequent 
because weakness of body and mind will not endure length of meditations without tedious wearisomeness 
the like may be said of them 
that are infeebled with sorrow and distress of conscience 
or vehemency of temptation

how can he pray with affection that knoweth not the goodness of the thing for which he maketh request or offereth praise

when in conscience of our own wants and unworthiness 
we abase our selves in the sight of god 
willingly submit to his good pleasuredeut

and ascribe whatsoever we enjoy or hope for to his meer grace and mercy 
use it to his glory 
and do whatsoever he will 
i am but dust and ashes 
saith abraham 
thou hast magnified thy mercy towards thy servant 
saith lot 
i am not worthy the least of all thy mercies 
saith jacob 
who am i 
saith david 
and what is my house 
that thou hast brought me hitherto 
what is more odious then a proud begger 
are not favours bestowed upon a proud man clean cast away 
the self-conceited doth neither see his wants 
nor can seek supply with sense and feeling of misery 
nor return praise to god for the good things already vouchsafed unto him 
thirdly 
confidence in the truth 
power 
and goodness of god 
trust is the spring of prayer 
and by prayer affiance is quickned 
trust in the lord at all times 
ye people 
poure out your hearts before him 
in god i will praise his word 
in god i have put my trust 
what greater wrong can be done to his highness 
then to pray unto him 
and not hope in his grace and undeserved mercy 
fourthly 
attention and devotion 
that we have our thoughts earnestly fastened upon him to whom 
and that for which we make suit or give thanks 
we like it not in our children 
that when they come to crave what they desire 
or to give thanks for what they have received 
they should look here and there 
this way and that way 
without all regard of us or the thing they are about 
and shall we think that god will be pleased with such behaviour 
cold requests are of no esteem with god 
cold praises are like a raw feast 
distastfull to the guest 
it is the holy servour of soul that god requireth 
and is well-pleased with in all his services 
fervency puts the heart into an holy and spiritual diposition 
whereby we are more fitted to ceive mercy 
in prayer all the graces of the spirit are set on work 
and the more fervent the prayer is 
the more they are intended 
and this fervency stands in this 
that a man put forth all his strength in prayer 
though he have many difficulties 
and continue constant though he seem not to prevail 
but to be denied 
these two things make up fervency in prayer 
sense of need 
and hope of mercy 
need puts stickes on the fire to make our fervency the more 
but faith is the ground of prayer 
fifthly 
prayer must be made in obedience 
that we holily ask what is agreeable to the will of god 
and unfeignedly purpose to use blessings obtained to the glory of his name 
furtherance of our salvation 
and good of our brethren 
as he that calleth god to witness an untruth 
maketh him the authour of a lie 
so farre as in him lyeth 
so he that prayeth with a purpose to abuse the mercies of god to sinne and wickedness 
doth what in him is 
to make god the abetter 
maintainer and upholder of iniquity

that carrieth the duty of prayer in remembrance 
watch and pray 
continue in prayer 
and watch in the same with thanksgiving 
the end of all things is at hand 
be ye therefore sober 
and watching in prayer 
where we may see it is the minds waking that is principally meant 
though this will keep the body
from drowsiness in performing the exercise the primitive christians 
this is recorded of them 
that they did eat their meat 
as remembring they were to call on god by the night season 
more particularly 
there must be watchfulness 
before prayer 
in it 
after it 
now our watchfulness before 
stands in preventing the impediments 
taking the opportunities 
and marking that in the course of the day 
which may fit us for prayer 
for the first 
this watchfulness will make a man so cast 
and make such riddance of business 
that he may not have hinderances when he shall go to his duty 
god prefixeth a memento before the sabboth 
teaching that if one do not lift up his mind to it 
and in the six daies dispatch his business 
he cannot keep it when it cometh 
so there is a mindfulness to be had of him that will not this way be encumbred with distractions 
again 
we must watchfully keep our selves from sinne 
let him that calleth on the name of the lord depart from iniquity 
for if we let our hearts wander and rove after vanity 
if we be overgrown with earthly cares and delights 
if indulgent to our lusts 
it will be a damp to our prayers 
and when we yeeld to sinne it is a sign our watch is down 
we think not of prayer 
for if we meant to make suit to a man at night 
we would be watchfull in the day nor to lose his favour 
by giving him offence 
lest he should refuse us in our request 
did we remember that we are to seek unto god every day for the blessings of the day 
and every night for the comforts of the night 
we should not neglect his pleasure 
nor be regardless of his presence 
either day or night 
for the second 
a watchfull heart will not omit his seasons of communing with god 
when i awake 
i am still with thee 
at midnight will i rise to give thanks unto theepsal

because of thy righteous judgments 
as touching the third 
we must observe our wants in the day time 
as how prone we are to entertain vain thoughts 
to run into earthly-mindedness 
in wrath 
in voluptuousness 
in foolish and unfruitfull speaking 
and therefore what need we have to cry 
lord keep the door of our lips 
we must also mark diligently the sleights of satan 
whereby he seeks to ensnare and turn us out of the right way 
and what cause we have to pray continually to be defended against him 
nor may the chastisements of god be neglected 
whereby he intends to awaken us from security 
and stirre to a more serious inquisition of our heart and way 
god corrects to quicken in prayer 
and lastly 
we must labour 
as to have a sense of wants 
so to have a feeling of the good things god giveth 
of the evils he keepeth from us 
for without the one we cannot be poor in spirit 
nor beg unfeignedly 
without the other we cannot be truly thankfull 
nor offer up our praise heartily

even from pots to prayer 
when they have supped and given thanks 
though they have let their hearts loose 
eat 
drunk without fear 
sobriety 
prophaned their mouthes with light unfruitfull speech 
yet then before parting of friends 
call for a prayer 
and many are so farre from remembring themselves all day 
that they cannot keep their eyes open while they are a praying 
they are so affected 
as if it would cast them into an ague to be kept a while in prayer 
in some places where prayer is constantly used twice a day 
it is commonly gone about with little or no reverence
at all 
some talking 
some trifling 
some working 
some playing 
till the very instant of prayer 
yea 
till he that prayeth in the name of the rest be upon his knees 
and have begun the prayer that is offered up to god in all their names 
as though they had their hearts at command in a moment to come before god with that confidence 
reverence 
humility 
and fervency 
that is required in holy prayer 
this want of watchfulness is a common evil 
and doth us great hurt 
this maketh us such poor oratours 
that when we come to god 
we are barren of praise and request 
because we do not observe in the day 
matter for this purpose 
this causeth dulness and senslesness in prayer 
this maketh our prayers powerless and of little fruit 
this 
though we know it not 
doth make us complain of such mists 
roving thoughts 
indisposition 
because we walk all day long forgetfull 
if one should eat codlings 
goose-berries 
pease 
would you wonder if at night he were wrung in his belly 
would you not bid him mend his diet if he meant to see it otherwise 
so when we let our heart loose all day 
feed upon earthly vanity 
and rush hastily into gods presence 
how should they be heavenly-minded on a suddain 
when bed-time calleth on us to prayer 
wherefore let us stirre up our selves to keep this watch 
that we may see and walk in the strength of our prayers 
let us have a narrow care of our hearts at all times 
to keep them in order 
that they range nor after vanity 
let us as time and ability will permit

who we are 
even dust and ashes 
before whom we come 
even before the highest majesty in heaven and earth 
what we go about

q is it lawfull to use the voice in prayer
a 
there is a good and lawfull use of the voice 
not only in publick prayer in the congregation 
and family-prayer with others 
but also when we pray by our selves alone 
in prayer with others 
specially in the solemn assembly of the saints 
where the minister is the mouth of the people 
the use of the voice is necessary for the edification of the people 
because they cannot yeeld consent or profit themselves 
unless they understand what is prayed for 
in solitary prayer the voice and words are lawfull 
but not of absolute necessity 
not necessary 
because the lifting up of the soul is the soul of prayer 
which doth animate and give life unto it 
a man may pray fervently and speak never a word 
but words are of no worth if the heart be absent 
the speech of the sanctified heart is sweet and pleasant melody in the eares of god 
though the tongue keep silence 
but let the outward frame of words be never so smooth and well polishedpsal

the prayer is not pleasing if read and uttered without understanding and intention of heart 
the voice then is not necessary in solitary prayer 
yet is it lawfull 
for we read that david an holy prophet 
and a man according to gods own mind 
did not content himself with mentall prayer 
but used his tongue and voice 
the like may be said of nehemiah 
hezekiah 
daniel 
and other saints mentioned in scripture 
in the book of god such like passages are very frequent 
i cried unto the lord with my voice 
with my voice unto the lord did i make my supplication 
give eare unto my voice 
when i cry unto thee 
heare the voice of my supplications 
let the words of my mouth &ampc 
be acceptable in thy sight 
give eare unto my prayer that goeth not forth of fained lips 
before they call 
i will answer 
and whiles they are yet speaking 
i will hear 
i will turn to the people a new language 
that they may call upon the name of the lord 
by these places the lawfull use of words and voice in prayer is clearly confirmed

and to keep the minde from wandring after by-matters 
lastly 
christ the sonne of david 
though he were not subject to any such wandring of mind 
or faintness of affection as we be 
yet he used his voice 
even when he prayed to god in solitariness 
but touching the use of the voice in prayer 
these rules must be observed 
1 
if the uttering of words in solitariness do at any time trouble or hinder fervour and devotion 
it must be forborn 
for the use of voice is to help and further 
not to distract and hinder fervency 
2 
if opportunity of time and convenience of place be wanting 
we must speak in heart 
as hannah did 
that our voice be not heard 
3 
when we have greatest liberty in these things 
the voice is to be moderated that it be not heard of others 
for some would brand it with the note of hypocrisie 
and others take it as an occasion to discover the secrets of our hearts 
which we desire to lay open to god only 
and make a mock of it to our reproach 
4 
if we pray with others 
and be as their mouth to god 
the voice must be distinct and audible that they which joyn with us may understand it and be edified thereby 
5 
in the use of the voice we must look to the heart 
that it go along with it 
and be not roving up and down about other matters

rules to be observed touching the externall form of words in prayer 
the lawfull use of a set form of prayer in publique or in private 
also of reading prayer upon a book 
or using a stinted form devised by others
question 
what rules are to be observed touching the externall form of words used in prayer
a 
1 
greatest liberty may be taken in secret and solitary prayer 
because we are sure 
that 
if there be a beleeving 
humble 
and bleeding heart 
with an upright affection 
god will not upbraid any man for his method 
order 
words 
or utterance 
but yet irreverence 
and over-great familiarity is to be avoided 
2 
in private prayer with others we may not take so great liberty 
but have respect to the edification of others 
and reverence of the ordinance 
for in this light of the gospel 
where there is more knowledge than conscience 
the youngest and simplest in a family 
unless they be very babes and young children indeed 
will be ready to cavill and stumble at it 
and it may justly be feared 
that some christians well affected 
have been somewhat faulty and offensive in this behalf 
3 
special care must be had in the publique congregation 
that nothing be done but what is decent 
orderly 
and grave 
suiting with the majesty of gods holy ordinance 
because there many eyes do see us 
and many ears do hear us 
and indecency may breed great offence 
beget disregard of the pure worship of god 
wherefore in the publique assemly especially 
fit method and decent phrase of speech is in no sort to be neglected 
to place devotion in words 
is superstition 
to hunt after queint termes 
is foolish vanity 
to soare above the reach and capacity of the people 
is marvellous unprofitable 
to affect loftiness and obscurity which the hearers cannot understand 
is in the speaker arrogancy 
to them that hear fruitless 
injurious 
tedious 
and on the contrary 
to neglect a comely 
grave 
plain 
significant and fitting
manner of speech is odious barbarism 
it is good neither to be over-neat 
nor obscure 
nor too much affected 
nor yet over-homely 
but to use such a mean as doth most tend to the glory of god and the good of gods people
q 
is it lawfull to use a set form of prayer in publique or in private
a 
seeing the use of words or voice is not of the essence of prayer 
no man of understanding will deny that to be an holy and acceptable prayer 
which proceeds from a sincere and upright heart 
feeling its own or others wants 
and craving supply of god 
whether the request be put up in the self-same or in other words 
but seeing this is a matter mistaken by many careless and secure persons 
and a question moved betwixt us and our brethren of the separation 
it will not be amiss to note a few things touching the thing it self 
the persons by whom 
the time when 
the place where 
and the manner hw a set form of prayer may be used 
first 
the controversie is not of this or that prescript form of prayer in particular 
much less of one for substance of matter faulty and erroneous 
but of a prescript form in general 
whether it be lawfull to use any set form of prayer 
though for matter never so fit 
sound and allowable 
for externall form most grave and beyond all exception 
secondly 
it is not questioned whether a man may ask things impertinent 
as fair weather in time of drouth 
for it is acknowledged that the matter of our prayers must be according to the word of god and the present occasions 
thirdly 
a prayer for matter and externall form both holy and fit 
may be sinfull in the user by accident 
viz 
when it is repeated without understanding or intention of heart 
of this there is no question betwxit them and us 
fourthly 
it is granted that no prescript form of prayer is simply necessary either in publique or private 
for then our saviour christ by his apostles would have expressly set down such an one for an exact and unchangeable rule to all christians and churches 
not the necessity 
but the lawfulness thereof is questioned 
fifthly 
it was never held that a man should tie himself 
or be slavishly tied to a set form of prayer 
in such sort as never to offer up any petition or thanksgiving 
but what he meeteth with in his devised form 
for scarce any day passeth over our heads 
wherein there be not divers new occasions 
either of rejoycing or thanksgiving 
or else of mourning and craving pardon 
or indeed of both 
such use therefore of a stinted form is not to be justified 
for we know our requests must be framed 
our praises rendred 
according to the present occasion 
sixthly 
it is to be considered that there be divers degrees and measures of gifts 
both natural 
as wit 
memory 
and utterance 
as also of grace 
as knowledge 
saith 
zeal 
given to divers men 
besides there be divers states and conditions of christians 
some weak 
some strong 
some novices 
others trained up and better exercised in this holy duty 
some in greater freedom 
others perplexed with manifold temptations 
now they that are better gifted 
either by nature 
or else by grace and custom 
may use the more liberty 
others 
if they conscionably use a stinted form before others 
only inserting words and clauses according to new occasions 
must not be despised or condemned 
seventhly 
in prayer alone we may use more liberty both for methode and words 
in publique or family-prayer that must be done which tends to edification 
now for as much as weak and tender christians are not so capable of that kind of prayer which is called conceived or extemporall 
varying every time in words and phrases 
manner and order 
though the matter and substance be the same 
for their sakes it is not inexpedient to keep a constant form both of matter and words 
adding new clauses in confession 
petition 
and thanksgiving 
according to variety of occasions offered 
eighthly 
alwaies in prayer 
whether stinted or conceived 
care must be taken that we ask not things impertinent 
unfit
watchfulness must be used to prevent dulness 
security 
customariness 
slightness 
and lip-labour 
diligence must be had that no sinne lie upon our souls 
families 
or places of abode unlamented 
nor no mercies be unthankfully passed over
q 
what say you of reading prayer upon a book 
or using a stinted form devised by others
a 
first 
a publique set form of prayer penned or printed 
that is sound and pertinent for substance of matter 
grave and simple for order and manner 
not prejudicing 
abridging 
or hindering by length the preaching of the word or prayer fitted to special occasions 
is lawfull to be used in the congregation 
whether it be read or rehearsed by memory 
secondly 
if any governour of a family be so weak in knowledge and other graces of the spirit 
that he be not able of himself to offer up the morning and evening sacrifice in the behalf of his family 
let him 
if it be possible 
as labour and constancy will make it possible and easie 
commit some wholesome formes of holy prayers to memory 
though they be the shorter 
that he may not be troubled nor distracted with turning over leaves 
nor poreing on a book 
which will be neither so comely in the eyes of others 
nor so comfortable to himself 
and let him do this constantly and with a good spirit 
and he shall find by the blessing of god 
that in a short time 
his heart will be so enlarged 
and his mouth so opened 
that he shall be able according to the sundry occasions that shall be offered 
both with comeliness and edification to himself and others 
to insert such clauses and words 
as are profitable in that behalf 
and as they who are desirous to swimme 
by a little practice become so skilfull 
that they have no need of any corkes 
bladders 
or bul-rushes 
but lay them aside as burdensome and hinderances 
so they that be desirous to pray in the spirit 
by use and practice 
shall through the blessing of god become so skilfull 
that they shall have no need of any penned or printed prayers 
but rather lay them aside as things they need not 
thirdly 
if any new born babe be not able to go without this help 
let him not rest in this estate 
but labour and learn to pray according to his private necessities and occasions which vary daily 
and be so many and divers 
that no one mans condition in the world is in all things like unto anothers 
otherwise 
if he stand upon his stinted form 
he shall deprive his soul of much peace and comfort 
and never come to the knowledge 
sight and consolation of innumerable things for which he is to pray and give thanks 
to conclude then 
penned or printed prayers have their use 
and may be commended to them 
that by reason of weakness in grace and natural gifts 
as knowledge 
memory 
wit 
utterance 
inexperience 
heaviness of spiit 
are not able to do any thing without these helps 
not that they should stay in the use of them 
but be led forward thereby to do it of themselves with more comfort and to greater edification 
for out of them 
by paines and labour a christian may furnish himself with variety of matter 
fit words 
good method 
which being rightly applied to particular occasions 
do not a little quicken and revive and enlarge the heart 
fourthly 
a penned or printed prayer 
so called 
because the matter is delivered in form of petition or thanksgiving tendered to god 
is not properly a prayer as it is penned or printed 
but as it is rehearsed as a prayer with understanding 
humility 
confidence 
love

that form of prayer is just and lawfull 
wherein all things necessarily required in the word of god 
or essentiall to prayer may be observed 
but all things necessarily required in the word of god

fervent and faithfull 
and may not a prayer holy and meet for matter 
read with knowledge 
feeling 
earnestness of desire 
holiness of affection 
and faith in gods promises 
in reading the scriptures the eye doth lead the heart 
yet may they be read with judgment 
reverence 
meekness 
and joy 
why may not the same or like affections be moved in reading prayer

and if a prescript form of words may be allowed in thanksgiving which is one part of prayer 
it cannot be condemned in petition 
the matter of our requests must fit the occasion 
so must the matter of thanks and praise 
we must pray with the spirit 
and we must praise with the heart

and the same spirit moveth us to return praise for benefits received1 cor

in the dedication of the temple 
solomon used the very words of the psalm 
which david vowed to use at the bringing in of the ark into his house 
jehoshaphat in that execellent thanksgiving which he made 
appointed the priests and levites to recite a prescript form of words 
so did zerubbabel and jehoshua 
our opposites themselves grant it lawfull to sing psalms 
in which the form of words is stinted and prescribed 
and yet we must sing with the spirit 
and with understanding 
with feeling and joy of heart 
the differences which some put betwixt praising god with a psalm 
and calling upon god in prayer 
are little to the purpose 
do not at all weaken the force of this argument 
for thus we reason 
in singing psalms penned by the prophet david 
or any other holy man 
the eye doth lead the heart 
no less than it doth in reading a stinted form of prayer 
and yet they may be sung after an holy manner with grace in the heart 
therefore a stinted form of prayer may be read or said without book with that affection of heart which god requires in prayer 
let them disagree in other things 
herein they are like 
this reason may be drawn into another form thus 
whatsoever hath the true matter and form of prayer 
that is truly and properly a prayer 
and may lawfully be used as a prayer 
but a prescript form of prayer 
sound and fit for matter 
grave for the manner of penning 
said as a prayer with knowledge 
faith 
reverence 
and fervency of affection 
hath the true matter and form of prayer 
for the matter of our prayers is those common blessings and special good things 
which according to the will and pleasure of god 
we are to beg of him for our selves and others 
the true form of prayer 
understand prayer uttered with the voice 
is that outward disposition and frame of words 
and the inward elevation or lifting up of the heart to god by the holy ghost 
will any man object 
that all these things cannot be observed in a stinted form of prayer 
common experience will confute him 
who knoweth not the matter of many prescript formes of prayer to be good and necessary for all men 
all our wants and particular occasions are not mentioned or laid open in the prayers 
which are conceived by the minister or governour o he family 
and yet no man judgeth them unlawfull 
though they be imperfect 
it is not prejudiciall then to the lawfull use of a prescript form 
that many particulars which we stand in need of 
are not therein mentioned 
can it not be read or uttered with a right disposition of heart 
how then can we sing with joy 
or praise god with cheerfulness in a stinted or set form of words 
is it not easier to cry for what we need with feeling 
than to return praise with love and joyfulness for what we have received 
he that will confess it possible to give thanks aright in a set form of words devised by others or invented of himself 
cannot deny the same in request with any shew of truth or colour of reason 
2 
there are certain common blessings which we and others daily stand in need of 
and for which we are continually to give thanks 
and these it is lawfull to ask daily in a set form of words 
or for them to give thanks 
thus we may pray every day for
the encrease of faith 
patience 
meekness 
love 
&ampc 
and the continuance of those outward blessings which we enjoy 
for it is not the repetition of the same words in prayer every day that displeaseth the lord 
but the ignorant 
rash 
cold 
customary 
superstitious and irreverent pouring forth of words before him 
variety of phrase doth not delight his majesty 
nor will he reject the desires of an humble and contrite heartmat

because they are tendred often in one and the same words 
paul writing at severall times upon divers occasions unto divers people 
yet used the same form of prayer 
and the same words in his salutations and valedictions 
the reason in brief is this 
it is lawfull to ask common blessings of god daily in a set form of words 
therefore it is not unlawfull to use a set form of prayer 
and if to pronounce it be lawfull 
then to read it also 
for reading in it self is not impure 
as pronouncing cannot make an evil matter good 
no more can reading make a good matter evil 
pronouncing and reading being adjuncts of prayer both indifferent 
3 
the spirit of grace inableth us to pray 
and maketh requests for us 
but it worketh by means 
it instructeth us what to ask 
not in what phrase of speech 
it stirreth up in us holy desires 
but gives not ability without help 
suddainly to express and lay open our hearts in fit method and words significant 
as the spirit doth perswade and assure the heart that the scripture is the word of god 
not witnessing of the letters 
syllables and words 
but of the matter and saving truth therein contained 
so the spirit instructeth us to pray by opening our eyes to see our misery 
and enflaming our hearts with longing desire of mercy and relief 
but ability to utter and express these our desires in decent phrase of speech it doth not ever give 
ability of speech is a common gift of the spirit 
which is bestowed upon good and bad 
wherein graceless persons are many times preferred before the most sincere and upright 
again 
the spirit acquainteth us with our particular miseries 
and the good things that we are to crave 
by the exercise of means 
whereby we come to the more full and distinct understanding of both these 
these things considered 
i suppose all men will grant without contradiction 
first 
that it is lawfull for a man beforehand to meditate upon his particular wants 
and the necessities of others 
that he may more fully understand 
and more sensibly be affected with them 
secondly 
the better to stirre up confidence and affection 
and to furnish himself with words and matter 
it is not unlawfull nor unprofitable to read the prayers of the godly registred in holy writ 
or in other godly books 
to observe the matter of their 
prayers 
their ferventness in praying 
and the arguments wherewith they contended and pressed to be heard 
thirdly 
after that by reading and meditation a christian hath collected matter for prayer 
he may study to digest it into due order 
and to express his requests in fit and comely words 
and the same so conceived he may utter as a prayer according as occasion shall offer it self 
the reason may be thus contracted 
if the spirit of god doth work by means 
and stirre up good desires 
but gives not ability to express them in comely and significant words 
then it is lawfull for us to use all godly means to quicken the graces of god in us 
and to premeditate in what manner we might utter our prayers 
as might best serve for our own comfort 
and the edification of others 
and if the use of a premeditated form of words in prayer do not stint the spirit 
a set form of prayer cannot be injurious to the spirit 
grant the one 
and the other will follow 
4 
when the matter and substance of prayer is allowable and fit in respect of our occasions and the necessities of the church 
when the order of words and phrase of speech 
in which that matter is expressed 
is grave 
plain 
and simple 
we desire to know why it should be a sinne to pronounce or use that form as a prayer 
is it for that it is read or pronounced 
or because a man cannot lift up his heart in faith unto god 
when he uttereth his requests in a stinted form 
to assign the former 
is superstition 
to pretend the later 
is
to offend against common experience 
a reason then cannot be given 
why it should be unlawfull to pray after that manner 
it will be objected 
that stinted prayer is in or gods ordinance 
the answer is 
that prayer is the ordinance of god 
but whether our prayer be only conceived in heart 
or uttered by words 
whether in our own 
or others words 
whether by pronouncing or reading 
that is not appointed 
god requires that we should lift up our hearts unto him 
and ask in the name of christ whatsoever we stand in need of 
and is agreeable to his will 
but when spake he one word of praying within book or without 
in this or that form of words 
can that be sinne 
which he never forbade 
can that be unapproved worship which is conformable to the will of god 
5 
this reason draws on another1 joh 
34 
gal 
310 
when another prayeth that is a a set form to him that hears 
for though his spirit be more enlarged 
he is bound to keep his mind intent upon the things prayed for by the other 
though he be limited for a time 
at other times he is at liberty to pray as freely as he can 
the largeness of the heart stands not so much in the multitude and variety of expressions 
as in the extent of affection

which is this 
that which is the breach of no commandement 
which is no where disallowed in the word of god 
either in express words or by necessary consequence 
that is no sinne 
for sinne is the transgression of the law 
and where there is no law 
there can be no sinne 
but the use of a prescript or stinted form of prayer 
is the breach of no commandement 
is no where disallowed in the word of god 
our brethren of the separation tell us 
it is a trensgression of the second commandement 
and a quenching of the spirit 
but seeing the scope of the second commandement is to teach the true and pure worship of god 
how can a prayer for matter and form 
lawfull and pure 
uttered and read with knowledge and intention of heart 
be a breach of that holy precept 
the exposition of the commandements is to be found in the prophets and apostles 
first 
doth the lord by his prophets or apostles in any place restrain us to the use of conceived prayer 
as for the other 
that quencheth the spirit 
which is as water to allay 
cool 
or extinguish the heat of this holy fire 
but by what reason or scripture can this imputation be cast upon the use of a set form of prayer 
secondly 
reading godly books is profitable to stirre up and revive the graces of gods spirit in us 
were it not a wonder if reading a godly prayer should produce the contrary effect 
mr smith cast reading of the scriptures out of the assemly 
because in his opinion it quenched the spirit 
our brethren are not gone so farre 
but it is good for them to consider 
how they can condemn the reading or uttering of a godly prayer 
both in publique and private 
as that which quencheth the spirit 
and not condemn withall the reading of godly books 
and studying for sermons 
but of this hereafter 
6 
set forms of catechism are no more commanded of god 
then set forms of prayer 
christ our saviour 
the prophets and apostles have no more appointed the one then the other 
therefore if a set form of prayer is to be disallowed 
a prescript form of catechism must of necessity be condemned 
but how absurd it is to censure the use of a prescript form of catechism 
he is starke blind that seeth not 
the necessity antiquity 
and excellency of catechizing is known to them 
that know any thing touching the building and governing the house of god 
the use and profit of a set form of catechisme is by experience manifest to them 
who have laboured to lay the foundation of christian religion 
and train up their people in sound knowledge 
mr robinson himself acknowledgeth thus much in his additions to mr perkins his six principles 
howsoever they judged of stinted catechismes in former times 
7 
in the scriptures we find prescript formes of blessing 
petition and thanksgiving 
ordinary and extraordinary 
appointed of the lord 
we say not that the priests in blessing 
or the sanits in praying were necessarily bound to those very words and syllables 
but they might use them lawfully and without sin 
as we do warrantably retain the form of baptism prescribed by our saviour christ 
though we be not tied by an absolute necessity to rehearse the same words 
in that very order and so many syllables 
the argument from those places is this 
if it be lawfull to use a prescript form of blessing 
prayer 
thanksgiving and baptizing 
set down in the word of god 
then all prescript
forms of prayer are not to be condemned 
what answer do our brethren returne to this argument 
they tell us 
the priests and saints of god were not bound to use those very words set down 
and none other or otherwise 
nor do we plead against them herein 
though mr ainsworth in his annotations upon numbers out of the jewish rabbins 
seems to deny this liberty 
it sufficeth that these forms of blessing and prayer might lawfully be used as a blessing and prayer 
though in conscience they were not tied necessarily to the use of them 
the lawfull 
not the necessary use of a prescript form of prayer 
is now in question 
and that is proved by the places above recited2 chro 
513 
with psal 
1361 
for if the saints in former times might pray in a stinted form of words 
indited by others or invented by themselves 
as we find they might and didjer 
3311 
with ezr 
310 
11 
we also at this day may do the same 
but they answer further 
it followes not that a prescript form of prayer invented by men is lawfull 
because a form prescribed of god is good and to be allowed 
a meer shift of no force at all 
for the question is not of this or that form in particular 
but of a prescript form in it self considered 
the lords prayer was indited or prescribed by christ himself 
and yet they deny the use of it as a prayer 
and most of their reasons do conclude against the use of every prescript form of prayer 
as well as any one 
thus they dispute 
if a set form of prayer be lawfull 
then a man may carry his prayers in his pocket 
buy them at a book-binders shop 
&ampc 
doth not this reasoning disallow all penned and printed forms 
as well as one 
but if it shall please them to hear with patience 
the consequence of that argument which they make for us 
may easily be justified from their own grounds 
for they teach that god hath not appointed in his word any prescript form 
which upon necessity we are tied to use at any time 
that the matter of our prayers is divers according to the severall occasions which happen and fall out 
that the inward form is the elevation of the soul to god in humility 
love 
fear 
and confidence 
from which premisses it will necessarily follow 
that if one form of prayer may be used lawfully 
another fit for matter 
and grave for order and phrase of speech 
may be used also 
for none is absolutely commanded 
and all things essentially required in prayer 
may be observed in one no less then in another 
nay 
if what they teach of stinted prayer may pass for truth 
sc 
that it cannot be uttered by the direction of the spirit 
that is a lip-labour 
&ampc 
then it is more lawfull to use a set form devised by men 
than that which is indited by the holy ghost 
seeing the more holy the thing is 
the greater sin is the abuse of itexo 
207 
numb 
415 
and it is more hainous to pollute the words of the holy ghost 
than the words of sinfull men 
8 
as in the ministry of the word 
the corruption of mans heart 
and the hainousness of sin 
may more lively and fully be discovered to the conscience for humiliation 
then a man of himself is able to set it forth 
so in prayer penned by a godly and well-experienced christian 
the case of a distressed soul may be more pithily and amply deciphered and anatomised 
then he of himself can lay it open 
and in such a case to deny him this lawfull help 
is to take a crutch from the lame 
bread from the hungry 
in the very act of prayer it is lawfull to use outward helps 
whereby we may be inabled to pray better 
and is it not lawfull for a perplexed heart burdened with sinne 
and overwhelmed with bitter anguish 
to use the help of a book 
that he might the better unfold and lay open his misery into the bosome of his heavenly father 
sure he hath not felt those agonies and depths of sorrows which oppress many 
that is so cruell and hard-hearted towards the afflicted 
as to deny them this means of comfort 
the holy ghost by his prophet doth prescribe a form of prayer for the afflicted 
that they might learn to pour out their souls before the throne of gracepsal 
1021 
vise vatabl 
in psal 
102 
calvin 
ibid 
as the title of the 102 psalm doth shew 
which runneth thus 
a prayer of or for the afflicted when he is in distress 
the ample and particular laying open of our necessities doth ease the heart and move affections 
and when this may be done better by the
help of a book than of our selves 
is it not senseless to accuse the use thereof as a lip-labour and quenching of the spirit 
it is the spirit indeed that doth help us in our infirmities 
but we must use means to stirre up the graces of the spirit in us 
he stinteth not the spirit who labours to blow the coales of grace 
and useth all lawfull helps at hand 
in most full 
free 
and particular manner to disburden his heart before god 
he doth not substitute his christian friend in place of the word and spirit 
who not able to lift up his own soul to god by reason of straightness of heart and grievous pressure 
doth crave his help and assistance in prayer 
and may not a good book supply the defect of a christian companion 
when we are dull and out of order 
we may joyn with others in prayer for our relief and quickning 
why then should it be intolerable to make this use of a godly book

the jews before the coming of christ had a prescript form of prayer and thanksgiving in the celeberation of the passeover 
and that which they used 
was 
as it is very probable 
approved by our saviour himself

after they had sung a psalm 
they went forth to the mount of olives 
doth seem to allude to their custom of finishing the passeover with certain psalms 
which the jews call the great halleluja 
beginning at the 113 and continuing to the end of the 118 
howsoever hymnes and psalms are such kinds of prayer as are not wont to be conceived upon a suddain 
but are framed by meditation before hand 
or else by propheticall illumination are inspired 
as at that time it appeareth they were when god by extraordinary gifts of the spirits 
inabled men to all parts of service necessary for the edifying of his church 
10 
all reformed churches at this day do not only tollerate 
but approve a set form of prayer 
i know not of what weight this reason is with our brethren of the separation 
but sure it hath been of great force with the godly in former times 
otherwise the apostles would never have alledged the practice and consent of churches 
to confirm the faithfull and stop the mouthes of the contentious
q 
book-prayer is an invention of men 
therefore unlawfull
a 
by this argument all set forms of catechismes 
studied sermons 
interpretations of scripture 
and conceived prayer it self may be disallowed 
reading the scripture is gods ordinance 
but the partition of the law into 53 or 54 greater sections is the device of man 
preaching is commanded of god 
so is the interpretation of the scripture 
but the phrase and method of sermons and interpretations is of men 
the matter of scripture is the immediate truth of god 
but the words and phrases 
which are as a vessel to convey this light unto us 
i speak of translations 
not of the original text 
are humane 
not of god by immediate inspiration 
god commands us to call upon him both in publique and in private 
but the words wherein we express our desires are our own 
both in conceived and stinted prayer 
these two kinds of prayer agree in their author 
matter 
form 
object 
end and common nature 
and the one is no more a strange worship or invention of men than the other 
we find direction in the word of god 
to whom 
for what 
with what heart and affections we ought to pray 
but in what method or frame of speech we must be petitioners 
we find nothing prescribed in particular 
nor do we judg any thing to be necessary 
more then that order 
fitness 
decency and edification be regarded
chap 
vi 
prayer is to be made in a language that we our selves understand 
and those that joyn with us 
how we are to address our selves unto god 
and whether to begin our prayers with petition or thanksgiving
question 
in what language must our prayers be offered unto god
a 
in a known language that we understand 
for if we joyn with others an unknown language profiteth not 
if we pray alone 
what is more ridiculous than to speak words which we understand not 
seeing the scripture requireth 
that all that is within man should praise the lordpsal 
1031 
it followeth that as he committeth sacriledge 
that withdraweth and stealeth away his affection from the exercise of prayer 
so doth he also 
which hath not his understanding attending upon his prayer 
and so much the more the latter then the former 
as the understanding may be perfect and full in a sort without the affection and devotion 
whereas the affection roveth and wandereth uncertainly 
when it hath not the light of understanding carried before it 
again 
when god speaketh unto us 
all the powers of our soul 
both in understanding and affection 
ought to stand up 
to receive that which is spoken 
and so when we speak unto him 
there is no faculty of the soul 
which may withdraw it self from the attendance upon the service and gift that we present unto himdeut 
69 
mat 
223 
and therefore the law in the whole worship of god 
requireth it be done 
with all the heart 
with all the soul 
with all the understanding 
against common prayers in an unknown tongue 
the apostle reasoneth thus 
all prayers to which the hearers cannot say 
amen1 cor 
1416 
ought to be chased out of the church 
which general reason wipeth away all private prayers 
wherein a man knoweth not what he saith 
for thereof it followeth 
that not being able to understand what he saith 
he is not able to say amen to his own prayers 
in like manner it may be said of him that prayeth in an unknown tongue 
that he heareth not himself 
that he is barbarous unto himself 
speaketh in the ayr 
not understanding himself 
is more than childish 
not only not understanding what others say 
but not what he himself saith 
hath the marke of gods wrath upon him 
in that in things belonging to his salvation 
he heareth a language which he understandeth not 
this may suffice to shew 
that prayer must be uttered in a known language 
the speciall reasons of this point will come to be considered in the severall kinds and parts of prayer
q 
if i pray with the tongue 
my spirit 
that is 
my affection prayeth wellcor 
1414 
but my understanding is without fruit
a 
it is absurd to imagine the gift of tongues to be severed from his understanding 
that by the gift of the spirit did speak them 
was that gift 
to the zealous pursuit whereof the holy ghost exhorteth 
a rapping out of words without understanding 
is this the great bountifulness and largess of christ towards his 
so highly commended of the prophet 
to inable them like a popingay to prattle 
or like balaams asse to tumble out words without any knowledge 
finally 
where ever was it read 
either in prophane or holy writer 
that man should be said to have the gift of that tongue 
the syllables whereof his mouth can speak 
when his mind knoweth no signification of them 
but this conceit is confuted of the apostle 
who affirmeth that every one of those that spake with tongues edified himself 
and that in such sort1 cor 
144 
as the church is
edified by him that speaketh unto it 
in a tongue which it understandeth 
and in the 28th versevers 
28 
it is said 
that he which speaketh with tongues 
speaketh unto god and to himself 
seeing therefore he so speaketh unto himself 
as he speaketh unto god 
to deny that he understandeth himself when he speaketh with tongues 
is to deny that god doth understand him which speaketh with tongues 
and how sottish is it 
that a man that understandeth not himself 
should edifie himself in spirit and affection 
when the affection is dead without knowledge 
neither can a man desire or affect that which he understandeth not 
and if speaking in a tongue which he understandeth not 
he can edifie himself in spirit and affection 
why may he not also edifie the church in spirit and affection which heareth the sound of the words as well as he 
but the apostle saith 
that the church heareth not him 
that is 
receiveth no more fruit by that speaker in a tongue which it understandeth not 
than if it had not heard him at all 
as for those words 
my understanding is unfruitfull 
they are not to be referred to him that speaketh 
but to those which are spoken unto in an unknown tongue 
this doth first appear by the adjunct of unfruitfulness 
which is annexed unto understanding 
for whereas it is a borrowed speech and similitude taken from trees 
which are called unfruitfull 
not in regard that they bring not forth fruit to themselves 
but in regard that they are barren and fruitless unto others 
it is evident 
that when the apostle saith 
my understanding is fruitless 
he meaneth not in regard of the speaker with a tongue 
but in regard of those which heard him 
secondly 
this is evident by the 16th verse 
where he saith1 cor 
1416 
that if thou praise god in the spirit 
an ideot cannot say amen unto thy thanksgiving 
because he knoweth not what thou sayest 
he saith not 
that thou canst not say amen unto thy thanksgiving 
or knowest not what thou speakest 
which he ought to have said 
if the interpretation of our adversaries had been true 
thirdly 
in the 17th versevers 
17 
he saith of him that speaketh in the spirit 
thou verily givest thanks 
but another is not edified 
and most evidently in the 19th versevers 
19 
where 
saying that in the church he would rather speak few words with his understanding 
than ten thousand with the tongue 
he noteth the effect of speaking with his understanding 
namely 
that he might instruct others 
if therefore 
in the apostles language 
speaking with a mans understanding be to instruct others 
and not himself 
it followeth 
that to speak without his understanding 
is to speak to others 
with understanding and profit to himself 
and without instruction and profit to others 
lastly 
to pray in spirit 
is not to pray with the affection 
but in the strange language or tongue which is spoken 
which 
by a trope of the cause for the effect 
the apostle calleth spirit 
because that they who spake it 
spake by the miraculous gift of the spirit 
and so are those extraordinary gifts called spiritsvers 
12 
vers 
1 
and so 
by another trope of one part put for the whole 
they are called spiritual 
so that to pray or to speak in or by the spirit 
is the same which luke saith of them which had received the holy ghost at pentecostact 
24 
that they spake with strange tongues 
even as the spirit gave unto them to utter 
this exposition also the scholiast setteth forth 
and that it cannot be understood of the affection or devotion of the soul 
it is evident by the 16th verse 
where he affirmeth that an unlearned man cannot say amen unto the thanksgiving that is made in or by the spirit 
yet we know that the affection or devotion hindereth not the understanding of the rude and unlearned 
but the uttering of things in such language as he understandeth not

hear the prayer of thy servant 
and so it is lawfull for a christian in private prayer to say our father 
especially if before he begin 
he use 
as is most meet 
some short meditation 
and think of wife 
children 
parents 
kinsfolks 
neighbours 
yea of the whole church
q 
whether is it expedient to begin our prayers with petition or thanksgiving 
with praise or complaint and confession of sinnes
a 
herein we may use our christian liberty 
as god shall minister occasion by his providence 
and move our hearts by his holy spirit 
we have examples of both kindes in the holy scripture 
both in the prophets and apostles 
and in christ himself 
who have sometimes begun with the one 
and sometimes with the other 
when god doth shew us any special mercy and favour 
it will be most fit to begin with thanksgiving and admiration of his goodness 
as peter didact 
1211 
and when he doth frown upon us 
and bring us into danger and trouble1 king 
2223 it is most fit to begin with petition and request 
as jehoshaphat did 
yet in our ordinary and usuall prayers 
and offering up of our morning and evening sacrifice to god 
we may begin indifferently with either 
abrahams servant first makes his request to god 
and seeing the success answerable to the desire of his heart 
he returneth praisegen

blessed be the lord god of my master abraham 
when david was stayed by the wise admonition of abigail from shedding innocent blood 
he had occasion to acknowledge his sinne 
as his rashness and bloody resolution to have made a massacre of so many innocent persons 
yet the mercy of god preventing him by his blessing 
did so affect him 
that it made him break out into thanksgiving 
and put praise before petitionluk

and time thereof 
motives to frequent prayer 
gesture to be used therein
question 
what are the most common and general impediments of prayer
a 
the principal are these 
first 
since the fall the soul naturally loveth to spend and scatter it self about these present sensible things 
and cannot without some strife gather it self together 
and fix upon heavenly things 
now this talking with god requires an actuall bent of the mind 
and carrieth up the whole soul into heaven 
and exerciseth as all the parts 
so all the graces of the soul 
faith especially 
prayer being nothing else but the flame of faith 
and satan knowing 
that when we send up our prayers to god 
it is to fetch supply against him 
troubleth the soul 
weak of it self 
with a world of distractions 
secondly 
self-sufficiency whereby men dwell too much in themselves 
is one main cause of the neglect of this entercourse and dealing with god by prayer 
he that hath nothing at home will seek abroad 
the hungry belly will ask earnestly 
and thankfully receive an almes 
the poor man speaketh supplications 
and returneth thanks 
if we were poor in spirit 
and saw our own emptiness 
it would force us out of our selves to seek supply 
and raise mindfulness of what we have received 
thirdly 
mindlesness of what we want 
and what mercies god hath freely vouchsafed unto us 
is one speciall cause of slackness in prayer 
how can he crave to be relieved 
that feels no lack of any good 
how should he be fervent in praises 
that considereth not in what he is beholding for invaluable benefits heaped upon him 
4 
a mind drowned in the enticements or baits of sensual delights and pleasures 
can think of nothing that is above 
can savour nothing that pertains to the kingdom of heavenluk

when the city of jerusalem was destitute of inhabitant 
and the sanctuary of god troden under-foot 
but commonly god was worshipped towards the arke 
whence it is described from that adjunct 
that it is the arke of god 
whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts 
that dwelleth between the cherubims 
and because david translated the sanctuary or tabernacle of the covenant 
wherein the arke was 
into mount zion 
therefore he makes mention of zion so often 
and desires to be heard out of zion 
and this manner of praying was retained afterwards 
although the temple 
in which the arke was placed of solomon 
was not built in zion 
but in mount moriah 
when solomon bare rule 
the temple which he builded 
was the place of publique worship

we are commanded to pray alwaies 
to pray continually 
to pray without ceasing

as if we were to do nothing but pray 
but that day by day 
when it shall be most fitting our condition and occasion 
we must return to this duty 
that we are said to do alwaies or continually

they appeared thrice every year before the lord 
the lord also had instituted in his law 
that the jews should offer a morning and evening sacrifice 
private prayer is that which every man doth make unto god in private 
and as in the law god had consecrated the morning and evening for sacrifice 
prayers 
and hymns 
so the saints being to pray privately 
did observe the morning and evening season 
though the morning principally 
both because their minds are fitter for prayer 
and they did rejoyce to fit themselves to the publique institution of god

by this it sufficiently appears 
that we are daily and often to take up this exercise of prayer 
and that may be further proved by many reasons 
for our decayes of grace when it is not renewed 
our sundry wants and new appearances of evil which daily shew themselves

the daily malice of satan against us

do call for the daily exercise of holy prayer

to be a beggarly ceremony or element 
and those who are so perswaded 
are either fallen from the faith 
or at least weaklings in faith 
and if the simplicity and sincerity of the gospel require that we should forget the religious observation of the places 
it cannot suffer us to place holiness or religion in devised times 
nor do those phrases of praying continually 
or whout ceasing 
enjoyn us those canonicall houres 
for besides that their institution was not in the apostles time 
these precepts tie all christians 
whereas their houres of prayer bind their clergy only 
who of office are to pray 
our adversaries in their canonicall houres do erre many waies 
first 
in this 
that they make laws for all times 
of some example which particular men did freely upon some occasion extraordinary 
secondly 
that they multiply their ferials and houres abundantly 
above that the church of god can attend unto 
yea 
contrary to gods institution 
who hath 
that we might keep his worship on the sabboth 
given us six daies 
thirdly 
that they make them publique prayers of the church 
which are performed by the clergy 
whereas the clergy are not the church 
but the ministers with the people to whom it is ministred 
but the superstition and errour of our adversaries set aside 
it is not inexpedient to appoint certain times of the day for private prayer 
and constantly to observe them so far as fitness and conveniency will give leave

petition and thanksgiving
q 
what is petition
a 
it is a prayer 
wherein we crave of god the preventing or removing of things hurtful 
and the obtaining of things needfull 
either for this life or the life to come 
and that of meer grace through jesus christ 
this duty is known by the name of prayer 
request 
meditation 
deprecation 
complaint 
supplication 
intercession 
desire 
lifting up of the hands 
sighing 
weeping 
the request of the lips and desire of the heart 
and such like 
and the godly when they prayed 
are said to weep 
to watch 
to cast themselves upon their face
q 
why say you 
that petition is a craving of what we need
a 
we may ask that which is due debt unto us 
but in craving we renounce all other titles 
and fly wholly to his bounty and kindness 
at whose hands we beg and intreat 
when superiours will have inferiours do any thing 
they may lay their command on them 
and so bind them to it 
by reason of that obedience which is owing to them from their inferiours 
but when inferiours would have this or that from superiours 
whom they cannot by any meanes bind to them 
for the inferiour hath no authority or power over his superiour 
then they fall to intreaty 
not moving them otherwise then from hence 
because it is fit their bounty and rich estate should supply their indigency 
when they are humbly intreateddan 
9 8 
9 
19 
thus daniel and all holy ones have come to god 
not for our sakes 
to us shame and confusion belongeth 
but for thy name sake 
thy mercy sake 
do thus and thus 
for indeed 
in that we beg any thing 
we confess we have no title in justice to it 
and that it is most free for him we intreat 
to give it or not to give it 
if he please 
if i think a thing due to me 
and my own by right 
i cannot beg it unfeignedly 
as i would do a thing which is not mine 
further then the bounty of him i intreat 
shall bellow it on me
q 
what reasons may shew the necessity of this duty
a 
the first may be taken from satans malice 
and our own dulness and indisposition to this duty 
satan knowing that when we send up our desires to god 
it is to fetch supply against him 
troubleth the soul 
weak of it self 
with a world of distractions 
where he cannot corrupt the doctrine of prayer with heresies and superstitious follies 
there he laboureth to hinder the exercise of it 
wherein we should be so farre from being discouraged 
that we should reason rather thus that must needs be an excellent duty which is so irkesome to the flesh 
and which the devil so eagerly sets against 
the diligence that satan
useth to steale away the word of life 
that it might not take root in the heart 
commendeth to us the excellency of that heavenly truth 
surely that envious one would never seek to hinder us from prayer 
to molest us in prayer 
if it were not an exercise of singular use and comfort 
and we should never be so dull and untoward unto it 
if it were not spiritual and heavenly 
2 
our great poverty and want should move us to crave without ceasing 
alas 
what temptation can we resist 
much less overcome without fresh succour 
what cross can we endure without impatiency 
if we have not new support 
what success can we look for 
yea 
in common affairs 
without his blessing 
what good can we do 
nay think of 
without new strength 
when we do any good by his power 
do we not need pardon for the blemishes of our best performances 
what good blessing can we enjoy 
so as we defile not our selves in it 
without a further blessing giving us with the thing 
the holy use of it 
wherefore holy men knowing that god will be sought unto even for those things of which he hath given a promise 
in obedience to his divine order 
desire to receive all from him as a fruit of their prayers 
and gods manner is to keep many blessings from his children untill they have begged them 
as delighting to hear his children speak 
the consideration whereof moveth those that have nearest communion with god 
to acknowledge him in all their waies 
depending on him for direction 
strength 
success 
whereupon he delighteth in shewing himself more familiarly unto them in the sweetest experiences of his love 
guiding them by his counsell whilest they abide here 
and after bringing them to glory 
3 
this should encourage us to this exercise 
wherein lyeth all our strength 
that if in spite of satans annoyance and our own indisposition 
we will set upon this duty 
we shall find our selves by little and little more raised up to heaven 
and our hearts more and more enlarged 
god rewarding the use of that little we finde at the first 
with encrease of strength and comfort 
to him that hath 
in the exercise of that he hath 
shall be given more 
as other graces grow in those that are in the state of grace 
so this spirit of prayer receiveth continuall increase upon more inward acquaintance with god and our own estates 
4 
petition is the key of heaven 
a most excellent means of obaining every good thing 
the things we want are of two sorts 
such as we may by course of justice redeem 
and get to our selves 
or such which do meerly depend on the good will of persons 
and cannot be gotten 
but only by winning their good will 
thus there are two courses of getting things 
for we may fetch those former things by commutative justice 
by giving a penny for a penny-worth 
but the latter things we cannot procure 
but by humble intreaty only 
now all heavenly blessings are of this latter sort 
such as cannot be gotten 
but only from gods grace and free favour 
and therefore such as we cannot otherwise get 
than by moving him for them with humble supplication 
as this is a part of the kings prerogative 
to have his subjects petition to him for grace 
in regard of their temporall exigencies in which they are 
so this is the prerogative of that heavenly king

nothing so high above us

when prayer doth not simply ask things 
but ask them as meanes making for gods glory and our salvation 
and when no power but god can make inferiour things conduce to the glory of his name 
and the increase of grace in us 
hence it is manifest 
we cannot ask any thing religiously 
but of god only 
even as a natural man cannot desire any thing according to nature 
which doth not pertain to the continuing and well-being of nature 
so a spiritual man cannot out of grace desire any thing religiously 
which doth not some way profit to the conservation and perfection of that grace which is in him

prayer to obtain grace or glory is a part of divine worship 
but divine worship is proper to the lord alone 
5 
he to whom we pray must be able to hear all prayers in all places 
at one time 
willing and able to give all good and perfect gifts 
good for matter 
good for use 
and that alwaies 
to search the secret corners of the heart 
and to understand the thoughts 
but god only is every where present 
heareth all prayers 
is most willing and able to help 
knoweth all hearts 
and understandeth every imagination 
as for mentall prayers 
the angels often cannot know them 
the saints in heaven have no meanes how to understand them for ought the scripture teacheth 
had they knowledge 
yet the other things are doubtfull 
for they can do nothing which they will not 
and they will not do any thing to which god calleth them not 
they are so perfectly conformed to his pleasure 
and attend his beckoning in all things 
but we know it is the lords will to be called on 
and so to perform that he knoweth we want 
and he is both willing and able to supply it unto us 
6 
we cannot call upon any religiously 
on whom we may not religiously believe 
but we are to believe religiously in god alone 
to derive faith from any creature is a thing accursed 
bellarmine shuffles to decline the force of this reason 
thus 
he cannot call upon the saints 
who doth not believe that there are saints 
and in a manner hope in them 
but the scripture sheweth we should believe in the saints in no manner 
but in the lord alone 
it is one thing to have faith of the saints 
another to believe in the saints 
he that denies the former 
denies the communion of saints in the unity of the spirit 
he that affirmes the other 
hath neither learned christ or piety 
let us then make the name of the lord our strong tower 
to which we fly seeking salvation 
men love not to be sorted in any business but with their peeres and
equals 
so neither shall the living god like to be matched with his creatures

is it necessary alwaies to name the father 
or the three persons in trinity distinctly when we call upon god
a 
it is necessary to conceive in mind the true god in christ 
though not distinctly to consider the three persons 
the reason is 
because every act of religion doth require that we some way apprehend the object of it 
and as there can be no sight without some visible object propounded 
so no act of religious worship without this object in some wise conceived 
but in wishing the effecting of things 
it is not necessary to name any persons 
nay 
yet god indefinitely

it is lawfull also when we name persons

two

provided that we name not one as excluding the other two 
nor yet two as excluding the third 
for thus calling on one 
we invocate all 
and as naming no person distinctly 
we do not dishonour the persons 
so naming one and not others 
doth no breed any inequality of honour in our worship 
this is confirmed by the approved practice of the saints in the scripture

sometimes two 
sometimes all three persons in trinity2 cor

and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all 
the apostles begin their epistles thus 
grace and peace from god the father 
and from our lord jesus christ 
steven prayed when he was put to death 
lord jesus receive my spirit 
lastly 
we may name the spirit before the sonne 
and the sonne before the father 
for as that precedency seemeth derived from priority of order and inequality of office 
which is found amongst the persons by voluntary agreement 
so this latter naming of them 
seemeth to be grounded on the equality of their natures 
in the revelation 
the holy spirit is named before the sonne 
and st paul more then once nameth the sonne before the father 
now our lord jesus christ himself 
and god even our father 
who hath loved us 
and hath given us everlasting consolation 
and good hope through grace 
comfort your hearts
q what rules are further to be observed in our calling upon god
a 
first 
we must call upon god by those titles 
by which he hath been pleased to make himself known unto us in his holy word 
god hath revealed himself by certain titles 
properties and works 
that we might know what he will be to uspsal 
684 
5 
and make use of his name accordingly in our petitions 
secondly 
we must so consider of god when we come unto him in prayer 
as that we may see in him the things we desireeph 
117 
the apostle going to prayer for the ephesians 
who had believed on christ 
and about to seek the glorious gifts of the spirit
which might help them to know the glory reserved for them 
he setteth god before him 
as the god of that christ 
whom these had now received by faith into their hearts 
and the father of all glory 
both of them strengthening his faith 
for he could not think that god 
the god of christ 
would be wanting to those who were christs 
or that the father of all glory 
would deny these glorious gifts 
which he was about to entreat 
thus the saints still set god before them 
as having that in him for which they pray 
the church seeking courage against the rage of persecutors 
and that wonders might be wrought 
they set god before them 
as the god of poweract

paul seeking the consummation or perfecting of the believing hebrews 
he doth set god before him 
as who had from the lowest humiliation 
brought the head of them to glory 
this doth strengthen faith 
and inflame devotion 
when men come to ask of those who have enough of that they seek 
and to ask it in such measure only as that it is not any thing for those they sue unto to vouchsafe 
they easily perswade themselves that they shall speed 
we seek things more securely 
when we know them to be where we are in looking them 
and we follow them more affectionately 
when now we are gotten after a manner into the sight of them 
thirdly 
we must call upon god by such names 
titles 
or descriptions 
as are most apt to enflame desires 
stirre up reverence1 chro 
2910 
confirm faith 
or encourage the heart 
according as our necessity and disposition doth require 
majesty 
power 
bounty 
and love do shine in the titles of god 
and we are to make use of them especially 
that are fittest to raise the heart in desire and faith 
or to strike it with awe or reverence as occasion requireth 
if many and general requests be to be put up 
then such titles and names must be used that may perswade we shall be heard in all 
if some particular petition be to be preferred 
then choice is to be made of such titles or names 
as may help the heart in that particular

if thou be in deep distress 
it is good to adde the consideration of his power and goodness

648 
it is behovefull for every one that would make a good entrance into prayer 
without which he is not like to make a good proceeding 
to acquaint himself with the true understanding of the manifold names and descriptions of god recorded in scripture 
and then to make choice of such titles to name him by 
as are most fit to incite reverence 
confirm faith 
and are specially to be exercised in granting his
requestsdeut

fourthly 
the express commandement of god forbiddeth to worship him by any image or similitude 
and he himself sheweth in many places 
that he will severely punish the sinne of them that shall give his glory to dumb idols

and a thing no way incident to the authority of man 
to ordain who shall be his intercessour unto god to procure acceptance unto his prayers 
but christ only is ordained of the father to he our mediatour 
by whom we have access unto the father with confidence 
who is both able and willing faithfully to plead the cause of all believers with god 
2 
he that is to offer up our prayers to god 
must be our mediatour of intercession and redemption 
who is able to save us both by merit and efficacy 
for these two parts of the priestly office are so conjoyned 
that neither can stand without the other 
or be communicated severally to any person 
but christ only is our mediatour of redemption and intercession 
who is able to save both by merit and efficacy 
3 
to offer our prayers to god is to get them acceptance in his sight 
for there can be no mediatour to inform him 
but only to grace and speed our suits 
and therefore it is all one to say to cornelius 
thy prayes are come up before god 
and thy prayers are accepted with god 
all one to daniel 
thy words were heard 
and thy suit was accepted 
besides 
to imagine any other offering of our prayers to god by the ministry of any 
then that which doth purge out their wants 
and purchase their acceptance 
is to speak of god as of a man 
and to talk in a dream 
but thus as a mediatour to offer up our prayers to god 
we have only christ 
by whom only our prayers 
as our selves are made acceptable unto god 
4 
the scripture teacheth us 
that christ offereth our requests for us 
in that he is our high priest 
and hath reconciled us to god 
and the law of shadowes allowed none to burn incense 
but the priest that offered the burnt offering 
as the high priests answer to ʋzzia sheweth 
to teach us that none can present our prayers to god 
which are spiritual incense 
but he which purgeth our sins 
5 
the papists themselves being convinced with evidence of truth 
are forced to confess that christ only as mediatour doth present our prayers before god 
though they deny it again in praying to saints and angels as mediatours and patrones in a sort 
as is to be shewed afterwards

seeing it is his office to pray for usjoh

or beseech him to do his office 
it followeth 
that our warrant is also good to pray to him to pray for us

thereof we may make request unto him 
it being then evident in express words 
that he hath promised to pray for us 
it followeth that we may call for his promise 
these fellowes make out-cryes against calvin 
as if he should overthrow the intercession of christ 
because he taketh away his praying upon knees in heaven 
as not fitting for the glorious estate whereunto he is received 
but the jesuits by these words at once 
have made a clean dispatch of the intercession of christ 
that he should neither kneeling 
standing 
nor sitting pray for us 
for seeing we may desire him to do whatsoever by his office of mediation he hath promised to do 
it being 
by the jesuites divinity 
unlawfull for us to pray christ to pray for us 
it followeth 
that it is no part of his office to pray for us 
our saviour saith to his disciplesjoh

there being but one mediatour between god and man 
and that in matter of intercession 
whosoever setteth a created angel in the place of that mediatour 
must needs thrust out our saviour christ 
2 
if the angels offer up our prayers 
it is either to inform god and put him in remembrance 
or to procure acceptance to our supplications 
but god is not as man 
that he should need an informer 
nor can they procure acceptance to our prayers 
3 
the holy angels will not undertake an office to which they are not called of god 
but god hath not called them to offer up the prayers of the saints 
see the reasons before
q 
in the revelation it is said 
that an angel came and stood at the altar 
having a golden censerrev

in the words there is an allusion to the ministry of the high priest under the law 
and the angel is propounded as a priest ministring before the lord 
but that either the name or office of a priest should be given to an angel which is not partaker of flesh and blood 
is a skrieking only heard in the wilderness of the popish church 
never taught in the holy scriptures 
2 
the holiness of angels which are not partakers of flesh and blood 
although it were greater and perfecter then it is 
cannot make any supply of our wants 
whose defects must be made up by one of our own nature 
but this angel doth perfume the prayers of the saints with sweet odours 
3 
this angel offer'd up the prayers of all the saints wheresoever dispersed 
which cannot be done by all the creatures in heaven and earth 
much less by one only creature 
for if there were any one angel which could be in all places at one time and in one moment 
to hear the prayers of all the faithfull 
what needs so many legions and ten thousands of angels for the ministry of the saints 
4 
the jesuites themselves out of the verse before 
have truly affirmed that it is our saviour christ
which is plain by the reasons before alleged 
and by the manner of speech used in this place 
of another angelmal

he which appoints the supream 
appoints the subordinate 
and as no creature may assume 
so no creature may yeeld 
either supream or subordinate jurisdiction to any 
in things of this nature 
besides or without commission from the highest 
but the distinction of mediatour 
supream 
and secondary 
is mans device 
that we must not pray to the saints as authours of grace 
glory 
or any divine blessing 
nor yet as immediate intercessours to god for us 
which they prove by this 
that christ is the propitiation 
the way 
and reconciliation 
but herein they prove themselves to be gross idolaters 
for they do not only pray the saints to pray for them 
but they pray unto them as the givers of grace 
they call the virgin mary the mother of grace and mercy 
they pray unto her 
to protect them from their enemies 
and receive them in the hour of death 
and this they do 
not only to the blessed virgin 
but unto that saintless saint and sinfull souldier of the pope 
thomas becket 
2 
they teach not that it is necessary to invocate the saints departed 
or holy angels 
but that well and profitably according to the rules of piety it may be done 
but they speak of divine invocation directed to them being absent 
as our omniscient patrones and mediatours 
and they maintain that they are to be prayed unto in three respects 
first 
that by their prayers they would vouchsafe to make intercession for us 
secondly 
that by and for their merits they would obtain what is desired 
thirdly 
that they would grant the benefits which are asked 
for the saints departed 
according to their doctrine 
have more free access to god and christ 
then the faithfull remaining alive 
as being more nigh to god 
by their works of supererogation done in this life 
they have merited that god should hear their prayers 
and they are appointed of god the administrators of the good things which are craved of them 
thus they are made to be mediatours 
both in merit and efficacy 
betwixt christ and the faithfull living in this world 
by which their deceit is manifest 
when they pretend that they pray not to them as authours of divine blessings 
for no man can be called the authour of divine blessings according to piety and truth 
but the saints departed are called authours of their own benefits 
amongst which they reckon their merits for every one according to the papists 
is the authour of his merit 
and why not of the communication of it 
and if we ask grace or glory to be given for their merits 
do we not make them in a sort authours of those benefits 
and all this is done by our adversaries 
for they use formall prayers 
and do as devoutly and religiously invocate saints as the lord himself 
they make difference between their apprehension of god in their prayers 
and of the saints 
but the matter 
gesture 
and devotion of prayer is all one 
in their saint invocation they kneele down 
elevating their eyes to heaven 
uncovering their heads 
and prostrating their souls and bodies 
with sighes and groanes 
they say 
oh 
blessed apostle paul 
i beseech thee to deliver me from the angel of satan 
and from the wrath to come 
and conduct
me to heaven

oh god 
who hast granted us to celeberate the translation of blessed thomas 
we humbly beseech 
that by his merits and prayers we may be translated from vice to vertue 
and from prison to thy kingdom 
and which is more monstrous 
they use the same words to the saints 
they do to christ 
and apply to the creature 
what belongs to the lord alone 
this they excuse by a silly shift 
that though they use the same titles and formes of speech in the service of saints 
as they do to christ 
yet their meaning is not to attribute unto them the same holiness and merits that they ascribe to christ 
but an inferiour

the deniall of true and reall honour to the saints fully answerable to the titles which they give them 
must needs be as true and reall a mockery of them

not only to mean well 
but to speak well 
and such therein as will keep the catholike faith 
must also hold the catholike form of words 
again 
albeit they mean not such merits and dignity as belongs to christ 
yet they mean more then of right appertains to any meer creature 
for there is no merit or dignity in any creature capable of these speeches 
or of any other that are used in their saint invocations 
but the least that is meant 
is more then belongs to any 
but the lord jesus 
3 
if we allow their words that immediate grammaticall construction 
that belongs to all words 
they can import no less 
than the same service that is given to christ 
both really and formally 
nor can many of their prayers be excused with that more then unlikely interpretation 
for they give such titles to the holy virgin 
calling her the mediatour of god 
the repairer of the world 
the end of our exile 
the washing away of our sinne 
the ladder of heaven 
the gate of paradise 
as will not admit that excuse 
and by such like glosses 
all idolaters in the world may excuse themselves in the worship of their idols 
for when the jew to his calf 
and the gentile to his image bended the knee 
and called it god 
they did not esteem it in that degree 
that they did god himself 
but onely gave it an inferiour honour 
such as they thought an image capable of 
and when they were put to it 
would answer as our adversaries do 
though the word or action were one 
yet the honour was farre different 
but we truly reply unto them 
that the inward estimation and opinion of the mind 
determining the said words 
prayers 
and gestures 
to such inferiour worship 
as is mentioned 
doth not remove the reason of idolatry thereby from the said words and prayers 
because such as it is 
it remains divine worship attributed to a creature 
and whereas they talk of the merits of saints depending upon the merits of christ 
this will not stop the gap 
for christ hath by his obedience so merited or purchased all things for us 
that he hath done it solely 
immediately 
and incommunicably 
which are the three conditions of his merits 
and therefore he that but subordinates the merits of a creature to the merits of christ 
robs him of his office 
in that his merits have no condition to elevate 
or advance the merits of another 
to the making of intercession 
christ is not only robbed of his office 
by denying of his merits 
or not using them 
but also by using and applying them otherwise then we ought 
and not rightly 
which is done when we believe him to be the root of all merit 
but other merits notwithstanding procure us favour 
and reconciliation 
and eternal life with god 
therefore according to the scriptures we affirm 
that this invocation of saints which
our adversaries teach is unnecessary 
neither pious 
nor profitable 
but impious 
unprofitable 
idolatrous 
injurious to christ jesus

how may it be proved that it is not necessary for the saints remaining on earth 
to pray unto the saints now conversant with christ in heaven
a 
there is a two-fold necessity of invocation 
one in respect of duty 
which the faithfull remaining alive are bound to perform to the saints departed who live with christ 
the other in respect of end 
for the obtaining whereof invocation is ordained as a necessary meane 
the invocation of saints is necessary in neither respect

because the invocation of saints is neither commanded of god 
nor established by any threatning or promise 
which yet were necessary 
if in duty it were to be performed of the faithfull in this life 
it is an unchangeable rule 
that no man in gods worship exceed the limits of his commandements 
but commandement or allowance concerning the invocation of the dead can no where be shewed in all the scripture 
the censure of collen saies 
the scripture no where teaches the invocation of saints 
though notwithstanding for all that 
it be to be received and believed 
and in another book 
the same divines say 
the gospel indeed hath given no peculiar commandement touching this matter 
though it may evidently enough be gathered out of it 
but with such gatherings we are well enough acquainted

are fain to gather it from christs words upon the cross

that this invocation of saints ought not to be expressly delivered either in the old 
or new testament for two reasons 
which he shewes at large 
and they plainly declare he thought there is no commandement for it in all the bible 
pighius plainly granteth so much 
and he that shall peruse what stuffe hosius bringeth for the proof of this point 
may plainly see that he was of the same mind 
suarez the jesuite puts the question 
whether the saints departed before christ 
did pray for others 
and answers 
that in particular they could not whence it followed 
that in that time prayers could not regularly be made to souls in that state 
and that any man 
in that time 
directly prayed to the saints departed 
that they would help them 
or pray for them 
we no where read

that the saints in the time of the old testament were not invocated 
because they were not yet in heaven

that they hear our prayers or be acquainted with our desires 
but we can have no faith or assurance 
that the saints departed do hear our prayers 
our adversaries could never give themselves satisfaction in the point 
they have raked together a number of waies whereby they think to expound themselves 
but still they are uncertain 
and their waies unsufficient to stablish their own conscience 
as appears by the multiplying of their questions 
whether the souls of those that are prayed unto be present 
or not 
if they be present 
then whether it be really 
so that they be in the place 
where the party praying to them is 
or virtually 
only by 
i know not what understanding the things uttered to them in our prayers 
or whether they have the understanding of our prayers from others 
that give them knowledge 
if this way 
then who they be 
that give them this knowledge 
whether the angels that be about us 
and know our actions 
or god 
if it be god that gives them this knowledge 
then how he doth it 
whether immediately by himself 
or by the ministry of others 
if by others 
then who they be 
whether angels that are about us 
or the spirits of holy and just men 
that go from hence 
and tell the saints in heaven what our prayers are 
if immediately by himself 
then how 
whether directly 
and formally 
so that they see in him as in a glass 
by reason of the beatificiall vision 
what is in the creature 
and so consequently the prayers of the creature 
if they see them in god as in a glass 
then whether it be from the beginning of their blessedness 
so that instantly upon their glorification 
and so soon as they come into heaven 
and see god 
they see all things 
that we do in him 
or successively 
one thing after another 
but if god reveale the knowledg of our prayers to his saints 
not formally in this manner 
by force and vertue of his vision 
but only accedentally 
then whether it be not by immediate revelation 
so farre forth as it please him 
by his peculiar will 
to let them see what we pray 
as in this life he reveales sometime things that are secret 
to his prophets 
it is incredible 
and such as cannot be presented in any reasonable compass of words 
how the divines of the church of rome labour to shew these things 
and to make every man his own opinion seem most probable and reasonable 
but to no purpose 
for albeit we acknowledge nothing to be impossible to god 
yet it is not lawfull to believe any thing 
as his will 
which he hath not revealed 
for we must judge of his will by the scripture 
which touching these speculations saies never a word 
and being in manifest places appointed to pray in faith 
how shall we pray to them 
of whose hearing us we can have no faith 
for these things thus taught by the school-men 
relish well of mans wit and learning 
but what is there in the word of god to assure my conscience they be true
3 
this opinion of using the mediation of angels and saints departed 
arose from the gentilesphilo alexandrinus took this from plato 
euseb

and specially the followers of plato 
whose doctrine it was 
that the spirits of men departed 
and angels imploy themselves in carrying our prayers to god 
and therefore it is a good way to invocate them 
eusebius reports the words of plato 
certainly the souls of the dead departed have a certain power 
and are carefull about the business of men 
these things are true 
but the reasons containing them are long 
it is the best way therefore to credit that which others have reported concerning them 
the reports being so manifold and ancient 
the which words of plato 
cited sometime by a papist 
as eusebius his own 
and by hosius as approved of eusebius 
to prove the invocation of the dead 
shew 
not only the affinity of the opinions of the papists 
and gentiles 
touching this point 
but also the foundation whereupon they both stand 
the ancient tradition of their elders
4 
in regard of men the invocation of saints departed is not necessary 
because neither the merits 
nor the intervenient administration of the saints is necessary
to impetrate and obtain the good things which are asked by the prayers of the faithfull in this life 
for otherwise the mediation and administration of christ 
either is not sufficient 
or cannot be obtained unless the saints departed intercede for us 
both which are false 
and which of the saints first entred into heaven 
he needed not 
nor used no former intercession of any saintand if it had been necessary for him that first entred into heaven 
it will follow 
that no mortal man did or ever shall enter into heaven 
because where no man for this cause could be first 
there none of the saints first entring into heaven 
there no man can be second or third

the papists should consider again and again 
if they be moved with any good desire to keep a good conscience 
whether it be not better to omit that invocation 
then to perform it 
although it might be disputed whether it were lawfull or no 
of which hereafter 
that we affirm for these reasons 
first 
when whatsoever is not done in faith 
that is 
out of conscience certainly perswaded that what is performed is acceptable to god 
is sinne 
and therefore without sinne that may be omitted 
of which we doubt never so little 
whether it be lawfull 
when it is found not to be necessary 
it followes that invocation is rather to be omitted 
then to be performed 
secondly 
when the papists themselves confess 
that there is such difference betwixt the worship of latria and dulia 
that he commits idolatry 
who worshippeth him with that to whom this only is due 
and it is hard for ignorant people and devoted to the worship of saints 
to observe that difference alwaies without any error 
it is danger 
lest praying unto saints they fall into idolatry 
which reason also fighteth against invocation of saints departed 
although it be proved to be lawfull 
the papists themselves cannot deny but this invocation of saints is much abused 
let us hear the confession of some of them 
espenceus a sorbonist 
are they well and godly brought up 
which being children almost a hundred years old 
that is to say 
old and ancient christians 
do no less attribute to the saints 
and trust in them 
than to god himself 
and think god himself harder to be pleased 
and intreated than they 
would god i lied 
and there were no such 
george cassander 
this false and pernicious opinion is too well known to have prevailed 
among the vulgar 
while wicked men 
persevering in their naughtiness 
are perswaded that only by the intercession of the saints 
whom they have chose to be their patrones 
and worship with cold and prophane ceremonies 
they have pardon 
and grace prepared them with god 
which pernicious opinion hath been confirmed in them 
as much as was possible 
with lying miracles 
and there is another error 
that men 
not evil of themselves 
have chosen certain saints 
to be their patrones and keepers 
and put confidence in their merits and intercession 
more than in the merit of christ 
so far that the only office of christs intercession being obscured 
they have substituted in his place the saints 
and specially the virgin his mother 
lodovicus vive 
there are many christians 
which most an end sinne in a good matter 
when they worship saints both men and women 
no otherwise then they worship god 
and i cannot see 
in many 
that there is any difference between the opinion they have of the saints 
and that which the gentiles had of their gods
q how may it be proved that the invocation of saints is neither pious nor profitable
a 
this is proved first generally and then specially 
in the speciall respects according to which the papists say 
they are to be prayed unto 
generally that it is not godly 
we prove thus 
no action of it self 
and properly can come
in the name of piety or godliness 
but what is prescribed of god 
by whose word and institution every action is sanctified 
which otherwise would be common 
but it is certain 
that the invocation of saints is not prescribed of god 
therefore it cannot be called godly 
indeed an action may be called godly by metalepsis 
because it is undertaken for the performing of a godly action 
but that hath not place here 
that it is not profitable 
is demonstrated by the same argumentlev

isa

because all religious worship not prescribed of god 
is unprofitable 
as the lord himself hath spoken 
but the invocation of saints departed is religious worship 
as the papists teach 
specially we prove it according to the respects with which the saints are clothed of the papists when they pray unto them
1 
the saints cannot profitably be invocated 
as the givers of good things 
because the saints are not appointed of god dispensors of good things

for this office is given to christ 
to whom the angels are subjected as servants in that administration 
all power

david saith

thou art my rock

the papists make the saints departed to be the governours and patrones of men and countries 
and to have the regiment of the faithfull committed to them 
this they would prove by that of the revelation 
and he that overcometh 
and keepeth my works unto the end 
to him will i give power over the nations 
again 
to him that overcometh 
will i grant to sit with me in my throne 
even as i also overcame 
and am set down with my father in his throne 
but these places by all their wresting cannot be brought to speak for them 
for 1 
when shall the saints have this rule 
but in the end of the world 
when they shall sit on the right hand of god 
as christ doth 
and therefore it is said 
i will give him power to rule 
and he shall rule 
even then when there shall be no use of prayer 
which appeareth by that which he promiseth also 
the morning starre 
which is full enjoying of christ himself 
we deny not but this rule is begun after death 
yet so 
that it must be remembred 
that it is in part entred upon in this life 
according to their measure of victory against the kingdom of satan 
and their fellowship in the kingdom of christ 
whereupon we are taught 
that all the godly are kings whiles they are upon earth 
if then we must make our prayers to them that are departed 
because they have their fellowship in the kingdom and regiment of christ 
it will follow 
that they having this fellowship in this life are to be prayed unto and worshiped in this life 
2 
let it be observed 
over whom this rule here spoken of 
is given 
namely 
not to one faithfull man over another 
but to the faithfull over the wicked 
whom the faithfull shall break with a rod of iron 
so that if there be any warrant for prayer unto the departed saints 
it is for the infidels 
not for the faithfull 
and their reward for their prayer is no other 
but to have their heads broken with a barr of iron 
a reward very meet for such as will enlarge their marriage bed 
which they ought to keep undefiled to our saviour christ alone 
unto every saint 
3 let it be noted how farre this rule stretcheth 
even to all the coasts of the earth 
wheresoever are any wicked ones 
not to the regiment of one country or province alone 
which not only overthrowes the partition of countries to severall saints 
as every nation in popery hath made choice of their countrey-god and patron 
but also changeth the nature of saints 
into the nature of the most high 
as those that hear in all places 
4 
seeing this is a promise made to every one of gods saints 
who are many hundred thousands 
by this reason every one of them should have a regiment in the church of god 
which were infinite 
lastly 
christ promiseth
that they shall rule with a rod of iron 
as himself hath receivedthe blessed saints do not partake with christ 
as his ministers 
vice-gerents 
or coadjutors in the actuall rule and government of this inferiour world 
but they only partake with him in his government as friends of the bridegroom by rejoycing 
consening 
reaping increase of glory by his actuall government

will they inferre hereupon 
that the saints have the like kingdom 
and power and glory with christ 
this were very absurd to grant 
and against christ plasphemous 
the power then that our saviour promiseth to give to every christian that overcometh 
is the participation of his kingly inheritance 
first 
spiritually to overcome the world by faith in this life 
and after this life to be set in full possession of his royal inheritance 
not commission to one saint 
to governe in one countrey 
and to another to rule over another kingdom 
i will give him power to rule over nations 
that is 
i will make him king in my communion 
and fellow heir with me 
the sovereign power of christ is not actually given to the creature 
but the creature being in christ 
hath the fruit and benefit of this power in his salvation 
by this power the faithfull are inabled in their own person to overcome all the enemies of their salvation 
and by the same power christ makes all his servants 
being his members 
partakers of his glory in heaven 
whereas the whole world besides is condemned in hell 
touching the other place 
when it is said 
him that overcometh will i make to sit with me in my throne 
by the word sitting 
as lyra noteth 
may well be understood resting from labours 
which the godly must undergo in this life to obtan victory 
and it is opposed to the word overcometh 
but if any man will contend that the kingly power of the saints is signified in these words of christ 
it must be understood either of judiciary power 
or of the glory and majesty of the saints in heaven 
for that which here they are afflicted of others 
and have conflicted with ignominy and disgrace 
if its judiciary power 
that is proper to christ 
and synecdochicially in christ is spoken of the saints 
the saints shall judge the world 
not in giving sentence upon them 
but as witnesses and approvers of christ his sentence 
and seeing the scripture saith nothing of the judiciary power of the saints 
but what our saviour and paul pronounce 
which hath respect to the last judgment 
this must be referred to that day 
if it be so understood 
if we understand it of glory 
equality of honour cannot be meant 
for that is impossible for any creature to receive 
but such a participation of glory 
as shall suffice for perfect happiness 
for christ as he is mediatour 
is inferiour to his father 
and in that regard is not advanced to equall glory with his father 
though he sit with him 
so the members of christ 
being inferiour unto him 
may sit with him in his throne 
though their glory be unequall 
christ ruleth in the church by himself 
in his members 
in the world 
by his office and the procuration of his office 
the church ruleth 
the members of the church rule in christ by communication of person 
not by communication of office 
administration and operation 
further 
they object that of our saviour 
verily i say unto you 
that he shall make him ruler over all his goods 
our saviour there speaks after the manner of men 
who trust them with the administration of more and greater business whom they have proved to be faithfull in lesser 
he shall make him ruler 
that is 
every godly man in common 
and each particular christian in christ by common domination 
for they are called common lords equivocally in that one lord univocally so called 
jesus christ 
our head and saviour 
the goods 
are of inheritance 
the heirs are those who are called good servants 
the goods are one thing 
the good another 
whose the goods are 
and upon whose family god bestoweth his goods 
moreover 
they urge that of our saviour 
make you friends of the unrighteous mammon 
that when ye need 
they may receive you into everlasting habitations 
see 
the saints may receive their friends and benefactors into their eternall mansions 
the prayers of the poor are indeed procured by giving almes 
if they be thankfull

but no patronage in heaven

was a good almes-man

neither doth the text say 
the poor shall become patrones 
but they may receive you into the everlasting tabernacles 
which is to be understood parabolically 
your almes shall be a testimony of your charity and liberality 
which shall be everlastingly rewarded proceeding from true and lively faith 
neither is it possible to gather a conclusion out of this place in due form of syllogisme 
that the saints departed may receive their friends and benefactors into their heavenly mansions 
otherwise then by their testimony 
if in the judgment of god 
they shall be found faithfull 
finally 
almes given to an hypocrite 
in the name of christ 
of true faith and charity 
is acceptable to god 
as given to a holy person 
and shall be as well rewarded 
seeing god hath not made us judges of mens sincerity 
who have need 
but commanded us to shew neighbourhood to all that be in necessity 
especially to those that be of the houshould of god 
as farre as we can discern them 
lastly 
it is objected 
that the angels are appointed to be our keepers 
but the saints departed are equall to the angels 
first 
if it be granted that they are equall in glory 
it followeth not that they have the same commission 
or be appointed to the same work they want that commandement of god and ordinary vocation that the angels have to minister unto us 
for of them it is written 
not of the saints 
are they not all ministring spirits sent forth for the good of them that believe 
secondly 
in the places cited to prove the equality of angels and saints departed 
not their present state 
as they be severed from their bodies 
but their future condition 
what they shall be after the resurrection 
when being conjoyned with their bodies they shall not for all that be joyned in marriage 
is described 
for without this consideration of resuming their bodies 
our saviour christs answer to the sadducees cleaveth not together 
lastly 
our christs will was not to declare 
that the estate of the angels and godly men shall be in every point and absolutely equall 
but as to that and such like points as were in question 
we conclude therefore that the saints departed are neither dispensers of good things 
not the deputed servants of christ to be imployed in this administration 
but if the saints did give to christ by the commandement of god 
their subordinate labour 
as the angels do 
yet should they not be prayed unto 
for to this 
full power of dispensing is required 
which may distribute at pleasure 
but the angels do perform or exhibite to christ only ministeriall or instrumentall labour 
for which it is not lawfull to invocate them as the givers of good things 
but the saints cannot ministerially and instrumentally perform service to christ in this kind like the angels 
unless we shall say 
that they ascend or defend as the angels do 
when therefore they have neither authority nor power to give good things 
it followes that they cannot be invocated as the givers of good things 
either godly or profitably

in the peace of christ 
there expecting and waiting the coming of christ to judgment 
the jesuits teach 
that the saints departed may in person be present at the affairs of the living 
because moses and elias personally appeared 
and were present with christ 
the angels both for the generall government under god 
and for the speciall service they are to give to the elect of god 
have been and shall be alwaies conversant amongst men 
but the saints having received no such charge 
cannot be so thought 
unless the like causes and effects of appearance be alleged which be here 
cause there is not 
our saviour christs both person and office being sufficiently witnessed 
effects also there be not

therefore untill speciall causes be proved 
the general rule must stand2 sam

this appearance of moses and elias was extraordinary

see what opinion these men have of heaven 
making a prison of it 
by this doctrine it must needs follow 
that when the children of god in the latter day shall be put in full possession of the whole inheritance of the kingdom of heaven 
there to remain for evermore 
that they shall be in heaven but as in a prison 
and that they are there as it were in fetters and irons 
because they may not come down into the earth 
and why may it not as well be said 
that the saints in heaven are therefore in prison 
because they cannot go down to hell 
seeing all hinderance that staieth them from any place 
where 
not they desire 
but the jesuites would have them 
is a prison 
yet our saviour saith 
that there is such an infinite gulf between those in heaven and them in hellluk 
1626 
that the one cannot come unto the other

why should they not in a mislike of heaven

because he had written that they were in abrahams bosome 
in a place of rest 
from which the contrary may be concluded 
because the bosome of abraham is in heaven 
where they that be 
be with christ 
and to them that rest under the altar 
white stoles are given 
with which they stood clothed before the throne 
and in the sight of the lamb 
but let us see 
what hierome doth answer 
first 
wilt thou prescribe lawes to god 
no verily 
but gods law prescribeth a place of rest unto the souls of the departed 
and not i 
might vigilantius answer 
secondly 
doest thou fetter the apostles 
how unworthy is this question of hieromes learning 
as though the apostles were fettered

the godly are described to have followed the lamb in holiness of life 
whithersoever he should go 
to have followed him 
not as the scribe falsly promised that he would follow him so 
but as sheepe are wont to follow their shepherd 
whose voice they hear 
and obey him 
leading even to death 
to have followed him 
as augustine explains it 
what is it to follow him 
but to imitate 
because christ hath suffered for us 
leaving us an example that we might follow his steps 
finally 
to have followed him 
which augustine addeth 
not as he is the sonne of god 
by whom all things are made 
but as the son of man 
who hath left us an example which we ought to imitate 
and the lamb is every where in the majesty of glory 
not as the son of man 
but as the sonne of god 
therefore he is there also 
whether the saints received into heaven cannot come 
so that this text which is alleged for the presence of the saints departed 
at their tombes or other places 
if it
be understood of their following christ in glory 
it so crusheth this opinion of the out-courses of the saints into the earth 
as nothing can do more 
for seeing the heavens must contain our saviour christ untill the day of restoring all thingsact

it must needs follow 
that the saints 
to enjoy a perpetuall presence of our saviour christ 
must not pass the pale of the heavens 
which may well hold them 
seeing 
according to his humanity 
they hold the sonne of god 
besides 
this absurdity followeth of it 
that if the soules of the saints be present at their sepulchres 
because they follow the lamb 
the lamb also christ in his humanity 
is present at the sepulchres of the martyrs 
finally 
they borrow a reason from the celerity or agility of devils 
to prove that the souls of martyrs 
pass to and fro in the world 
as the devils do 
which is very insufficient 
for the devils 
not only by property of their nature 
but also by gods sufferance 
have such passage in the world 
but the saints 
by god are assigned to rest 
in the place of heavenly joy 
untill the day of judgment

and when they have done all 
to profess not only in humility but in truth 
that they are unprofitable servants

our adversaries themselves confess that there is no proportion between the good works of the saints 
and the recompense of reward 
therefore it cannot godlily be alleged 
which is falsly attributed to the saints

because the saints in heaven are ignorant of our severall necessities 
and the prayers of the faithfull living on earth 
what they bring of the glass of the trinity 
wherein the saints behold our prayers 
and what pertaineth to them 
is a most fond device 
which hath no ground at all in holy scriptures 
for god being simple and unchangeable 
certainly he must be a most simple clear glass 
ever the same 
which if he be 
why do they not see all things alwaies 
why not unchangeably 
as well as those that pertain unto them 
but that they should see all things in him is most false 
and repugnant to the scriptures 
for of that day and hour 
saith christ 
speaking of the day of judgment 
knoweth no man 
no not the angels 
which nevertheless do behold the face of the father which is in heaven 
again 
admit it were so 
as they feign it to be 
then this their glass hath a naturall or a voluntary representation 
not naturall 
for then the saints should see all things at once 
past 
present or to come 
not voluntary 
for then so much only is seen of the saints 
as god will have to be known 
but what assurance can we have 
that god will shew unto them our petitions 
moreover 
the papists do not after this manner call upon saints 
for by this reckoning they should thus say 
cause o god 
that this or that saint may know those things 
which i require of him 
and that he may be with me 
and grant me that which i desire 
but they deal far oherwise 
o holy peter 
say they 
o holy paul 
pray for me 
bring this or that thing to pass for me 
what they speak of divine revelation is of no less uncertainty 
for where hath the lord acquainted us with his pleasure in this point 
when did he make promise to reveale the prayers of the faithfull living 
to the saints departedthe manifold wisdom of god 
is revealed to the angels by the church 
1 pet 
112 
eph

not by vision of divine essence 
and if he have not made such a promise 
what ground can we have to believe it 
in matters of this nature is it not
gross presumption to determine any thing upon our own heads 
god did reveal some things to his servants the prophets at his pleasure 
when he knew it to be necessary 
but thence it doth not follow that he will reveal our prayers to the saints departed 
necessity that they should be made known unto them 
there is not any 
for god never commanded us to pray unto them 
never promised to enform them of our desires 
again 
what a ridiculous 
preposterous 
superfluous order is this 
that first we pray to the saints departed 
then god revealeth to them our petitions 
and then they sollicit god in our behalf 
from whom they know our prayers 
our saviour christ 
who best knew the mind of our heavenly father 
hath enformed us of another orderjoh

that the dead should understand our prayers by the explication of angels 
or report of the souls lately departed 
is disliked by the jesuites themselves 
and of the same vanity with the rest 
for the scripture speaks not one word of any such notice 
without which it is religion to us in matters of this moment to receive any thing as true 
or to undertake any thing to be done as godly and profitable 
and the angels themselves know not the secrets of the heart

that we may pray unto the saints departed 
though they hear not our supplications 
for some other may supply their office 
as he doth not in vain make supplication to the king 
who knoweth that the king will not read his supplication 
but some other in the court 
and that nevertheless he shall obtain his petition 
as if the king had read the supplication this is a device 
which shall be proved in the great year of plato

is this a matter of order

should be called upon 
and another should perform his office 
and supply his room in hearing 
praying 
intreating and granting his desire 
who seeth not what a miserable excuse this is 
if the saints be ready to preferre our suits when they be not particularly called upon 
but some of their fellows who do not hear 
will they not do it much more when we pray unto the father in the name of christ

his second answer is 
that it is certain they hear our prayers 
though the manner be uncertain 
because they be our patrones and take care of us 
but it is most certain they do not know our thoughts 
they be not our patrones 
nor do they take care of us in particular 
but only of the church in common 
as hath been proved already 
how should we think 
that the saints departed 
being absent from us 
should hear at once the prayers of the faithfull in all parts of the world 
when the scripture doth teach us no such matter 
they may pray for the church in general 
but they hear not our sighes 
they see not the wants wherewith we are oppressed in particular 
they know not our heartsrom 15 30

as if we should say 
whom we worship with latria as god 
he is the true god 
he shoud be derided 
so is this of bellarmine 
because there is no religious invocation 
but of god 
jam 
16 
who teach that we believe the church 
but not in the church 
that god the creatour might be distinguished from things created 
tharasius president of the second councell of nice saith thus 
we do plainly testifie 
that we repose and referre our faith and trust only unto god 
bonner 
a great patron of popery in his time 
and a bitter persecutor of the saints 
saith thus 
to trust to any 
saint departed 
we bid you not 
but to call upon them and pray to them 
we bid you 
and by this argument bellarmine proves that christ is god 
because the scripture saith 
blessed are they that trust in him 
and we are taught every where to put confidence in the true god alone 
all this notwithstanding 
the jesuites tell us 
that it is lawfull to trust in the saints 
but how should we give credit to them 
when they dissent not only from the scriptures 
but from themselves 
pulling down what they had built before 
bellarmine seeks another device to delude this argument 
unto whom we pray as god saith he in them we must believe 
but we pray not to the saints departed 
as unto god 
this poor shift is evidently confuted by his fellows 
who confess that we must believe in the saints as we pray unto them 
and so make that sentence of the apostle general 
and good reason 
for invocation is from faith as the effect from the cause 
and therefore we cannot religiously pray unto them 
in whom we do not believe 
again 
if one who is absent from us 
and who by nature cannot be present at our matters or know our affairs 
be called upon as present 
he is invocated as god 
but of this more in the third reason

invocation is a religious action 
and proper service of god 
such a principall part of his service 
that it is usually put for the whole 
distinguished by a greek and hebrew name 
never applied in scripture to any creature 
the life and force of it 
is 
the inward cry 
and secret request of the heart 
which no creature immediately discernes 
but god alone 
call upon me in the day of trouble 
i will deliver thee 
and thou shalt glorifie me 
as god only doth deliver out of trouble 
and is to be glorified for our deliverance 
so is he only in jesus christ to be invocated in the time of trouble 
the precepts 
promises and threatings in scripture concerning prayer 
do all shew that invocation is a divine worship proper to the lord in jesus christ 
it is the express commandement of god 
that we should call upon him alone in the name of jesus christ our only mediatour 
and also there is a manifest promise 
that praying after that manner 
we shall alwaies be heard of god 
our most bountifull father 
we shall never find in the old or new testament 
that any saint or faithfull man 
did ever pray unto any other 
save the lord alone 
and that in the mediation of jesus christ 
but the examples of them that have called upon the lord 
and been heard in mercy 
are almost infinite
3 
all religious worship and act supernaturall 
is either divine by certain institution and revelation 
or idolatrous and diabolicall 
but the invocation of saints departed is divine worship 
not instituted of god 
for worship proceeding out of the apprehension of that excellency of that is worshipped 
is of two sorts or kinds 
for either it is limited to certain times 
places 
and things 
when 
where 
and wherein 
the excellency of that we worship 
presents it self
unto us 
and requireth our acknowledgment of it 
as is the worship of kings 
princes 
prelates and prophets in their kingdoms 
courts 
churches 
and schooles 
ruling 
guiding 
teaching and instructing 
or else it is spiritual 
which in all places 
at all times 
and in all things causeth him that worshipeth to bow himself before that 
he worshipeth 
and of whom he craveth aid 
thereby to testifie his acknowledgment of the excellency of it 
which he findeth in every place 
time and thing 
to present it self unto him 
humane invocation is when one present doth crave the aid of one present or as present 
by means agreeable to nature 
as when we desire the saints present with us to pray for us 
or by messenger and letter acquaint them absent with our infirmities 
religious invocation is that which is limited by no circumstances of time 
place or thing 
because that which is called upon 
is presupposed to hear in all places 
to understand our sighes 
to be acquainted with our wants 
to be willing and able to succour us in all necessities 
and in this sort the romanists invocate the saints in heaven 
for they suppose 
that they know all things that concern us 
that they watch over us with a carefull and vigilant eye 
that they carry us in their hads 
and by their mediation procure our good from god the fountain of all good 
and therefore they worship them with spiritual worship 
but this religious worship is no where instituted of god by precept or promise

the worshiping of angels is expresly condemned in the word of truth 
and sundry testimonies of antiquity consenting with it 
the popish distinction of latria and dulia 
doth not answer these authorities and testimonies of antiquity 
for those erring miscreants mentioned by paul 
the councell of laodicea 
theodoret 
epiphanius and others 
did not think the angels to be god 
or equall to the most high 
neither did they worship them in such sort 
as to ascribe infinite greatness unto them 
which the papists mean by their latria 
but they gave spiritual worship and adoration unto them 
in an inferiour and lower degree 
such as the papists call dulia 
because they thought them to mediate between god and mortal men in very high and excellent sort 
either then the fathers condemned these without cause for worshiping creatures 
or they meant to restrain more then that adoration 
which ascribeth infinite greatness to him that is adored 
which undoubtedly they did 
ever the least and lowest degree of spiritual worship 
or worship in spirit and truthbellar

bellarmine and divers others labour to give a favourable construction of theodorets words 
and to salve the matter 
but they are so plain and direct 
that baronius takes him up for them in this sort 
you may see 
for it must necessarily be spoken 
theodoret by his leave 
hath nothing happily attained the sense of pauls words 
when in his commentaries upon this epistle he saies 
these things were written by paul 
because hereticks then came in 
who boasted that angels should be worshiped for who these hereticks were 
let him say himself 
and being once fallen into an errour 
he stumbled presently upon a worse 
that he saies the canon of the laodicean councell is to be understood of such hereticks 
as taught the worship of angels 
and erected an oratory to michael the archangel 
too inconsiderately attributing that to hereticks 
which of ancient time was done by catholikes 
but they seek to shift off this 
argument 
saying 
the apostle noteth the wicked doctrine of symon magus 
who taught angels to be our mediatours 
and not christ which answer is insufficient and too much restrained 
first 
for that both the doctors who taught this errour 
and the scholars who were warned not to learn it 
were all covered with the name and calling of christians 
and were either of the church 
or in some account members of the church of christ 
now that it standeth with the cunning and method of the devill 
at the first brunt to set upon the churches of christ 
with this point of worshiping angels with abandoning of christ 
will hardly be admitted of such as have been acquainted with his sleight 
who
first useth to thrust in his tayl 
that after he may draw in his head 
and whole body 
secondly 
for that the apostle sheweth 
that this errour was bred by a shew and pretence of humility 
or of their own unworthiness 
which is the very cloak of our adversaries to hide their idolatry 
in going therefore from the mediation and invocation of christ 
to the worship of angels under pretence of humility 
they must necessarily leave our saviour christ in an higher and more glorious estate than the angels 
whereunto belongeth 
that this errour of angel-worship is taught of mans wisdom or fleshly understanding 
which is to prepare way to the sonne by the servants 
that after by the sonne they may have a more commodious access to the father 
and this was the very opinion of plato 
who made two kinds of mediatours between god and man 
one of angels 
another of souls departed 
and again 
that the souls departed have care of mans affairs upon earth 
which false-named philosophy and vain deceit 
how fully it jumpeth with the popish errour of mediation 
each man may well perceive 
the difference only is 
that plato having no knowledge of christ 
could not speak of a third kind of mediatour between god and men 
as they do 
thirdly 
the reason which he draweth from the effects 
confirmeth this 
for therefore he would not have us go to angels 
but to christ alone 
because the fulness of the godhead dwelling in him 
they should look for their accomplishment and full perfection in him 
thereby insinuating 
that the adversaries granted 
that we have part in christ 
although not all 
the beginning 
albeit not the ending 
and if the angels had been appointed mediatours 
with an utter contempt of christ 
he would not have shewed what we have 
or come unto by christs mediation 
but it behoved him rather to have proved 
that christ is a mediatour 
which he taketh for granted 
disputing this only 
whether he were sufficient for all assaies 
without the angels or no 
against this 
that which they alledge 
that these men hold not the head 
is of no value 
for by these words he doth not note their errour which professedly they held 
but what at unawares followed of that which they heldgal 
54 
even as he telleth the galathians 
that they were fallen from christ 
if they sought to be justified by circumcision 
howsoever they thought that they might hold both christ and circumcision too 
for when christ hath the dignity of being the head of the church 
in that he is the only mediatour betwixt god and us 
whosoever casteth him from this title of the only mediatour 
with the same cast throweth him down from his most high estate of being the head of the church 
seeing it is the vertue and office of the head 
immediately to send from it 
whatsoever belongeth to the sense and motion of the whole body 
further 
how small warmth their cause gaineth by this rag of distinction 
that angels may be worshiped 
so that christ be not shut forth from being the chief mediatour 
it may appear by the story of johnapoc

who is reproved for worshiping the angel 
albeit it was farre from his meaning to shut out our saviour christ from his office of mediation 
to that part of the argument 
that there is no commandement nor promise to establish the invocation of saints 
bellarmine replieth 
that no commandement is required 
when necessity it self doth enforce us 
that no promise is wanting 
when innumerable signes and wonders done at the invocation of saints do sufficiently testifie 
that god heareth them who pray to the angels or saints departed 
but what necessity doth enforce the invocation of saints departed this life 
the papists say it may be done conveniently 
profitably 
not that it must be done of necessity 
necessity enforceth us to call upon god in the name of christ 
who knoweth 
willeth 
is able 
doth promise to help 
and will make it good 
but the saints in
heaven 
who neither hear 
nor know 
nor are able to help 
no necessity constraineth to go unto them 
as for the signes 
which are said to be done at the invocation of saints 
they are false or deceitfull 
or falsly related 
or falsly attributed 
or if true 
at least extraordinarily wrought of god for speciall causes 
and what doth this make to prove the ordinary invocation of saints usuall amongst the papists 
certain it is 
that miracles had an end in the church 
before the custome of praying to saints 
as it is now used in the church of rome 
was ever heard of 
again 
miracles are no sure notes of the truth of religion 
nor certain marks to know the church by 
unless they be strengthened by some other means 
not for that a miracle known to be so 
is insufficient to testify of the truth of god 
but because it is not possible infalliby to know 
that the things which seem unto us to be miracles 
be so indeed 
unless being assured of the truth of that 
for confirmation whereof they are wrought 
we thereby be perswaded that they are of god 
for seeing moses hath forewarned 
that god would suffer seducers to work wonders for the tryal of his peoples faith 
who besides him that gave them this liberty 
could set them bounds 
beyond which they should not pass 
who could precisely define the compass of that circle 
within which only satan could exercise the power he had by that premission 
be it granted that beelzebub himself with the help of all his subjects 
can effect nothing exceeding the natural passive capacity of things created 
he must be as well seen in the secrets of nature 
as these subtile spirits are 
that can precisely define in all particulars 
what may be done by force of nature

such signes and wonders might be wrought by seducers 
that such as would gaze on them 
and trust their own skill in discerning their tricks 
should hardly escape their snares 
let us briefly see what the popish doctors teach concerning this point 
cajetan writing to pope leo about the controversie of maries conception 
wisheth him not to suffer his judgment to be swaied 
by shew of miracles 
and giveth many good reasons of the uncertainty 
of finding out the truth by that means 
gerson noteth 
that in this old age of the world 
in this last hour 
and time so near antichrist his revelation 
it is not to be marvelled at 
if the world like a doating old man 
be abused by many illusions 
and fantasies most like to dreames 
yea 
the cardinall before mentioned proceedeth so farre 
that he pronounceth 
it cannot be certainly known 
that those miracles are true miracles 
which the church admitteth 
and approveth 
in the canonizing of saints 
seeing the truth of them dependeth on mens report 
that may deceive 
and be deceived 
but the jesuite at last hath found commandement 
promise and example of saint-invocation in the last of jobjob 428 
my servant job shall pray for you 
for him will i accept 
in the old testament as he confesseth before it was not lawfull to invocate the dead 
because they knew not our wants 
understood not our prayers 
by what art then can he bring it about 
that it was both commanded of god 
and practised of the faithfull that lived before the ascension of christ into heaven 
how shall it appear that job was departed this life 
the contrary is most clear 
how will he be able to prove 
that it is all one to invocate the saints absent in heaven 
and to request them being present with us on earth to pray for us 
but saith he 
they are alive and present in respect of hearing our prayers 
they live with god 
as christ teacheth 
but they cannot hear our prayers 
either by nature 
or ordinarily by ordinary vocation 
but what god doth extraordinarily 
he knoweth 
that the angels do behold our affairs 
not seeing them from heaven 
but being sent of the lord from heaven 
and present by their vocation 
no man denieth 
that they know our thoughts 
or offer up our prayers 
no man can prove 
that the saints departed are sent from heaven 
do hear our prayers 
or know our state in
particular ordinarily 
is that which never was 
nor shall be proved by any good reason or authority

this is confessed by the papists 
and confirmed by this text of scripture 
but prayer is a spiritual sacrifice 
and whatsoever is said of sacrifice 
that it must not be offered to any strange god 
that is generally true of all spiritual service 
and particularly of prayer 
as we must not sacrifice to any other god 
so we are charged not to lift up our hands to any strange god 
and what may be said for prayer to saints 
that way be pretended in defence of sacrificing unto them 
almes are called sacrifices 
because they be not so much given to the poor 
as offered unto god 
and accepted of him as a sweet favour 
god needeth not our beneficence 
but he promiseth to recompence it 
as if it were bestowed upon himself 
hence solomon 
he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord
5 
to give spiritual worship to them that were no saints 
that never had being in this life 
and that for ought can be known 
are damned in hell 
must needs be fruitless 
superstitious 
and abominable 
but the papists invocate them that never were 
for ought they can prove 
and that were damned in hell for ought they know 
it is manifest by the silence of all approved authors 
that there was never such a man as that saint george 
whom the papists call upon 
baronius supposeth that which is painted of saint george 
to be an emblem 
not an history 
but though the history of george be apocryphal or uncertain 
saith bellarmine 
yet there was such a saint 
because the memory of george was ever famous in the church 
but this is spoken sophistically 
or directly contrary to the truth 
the fame of that man was great 
but not good 
for athanasius 
and gregory nazianzene 
do witness that george cappadox a wicked man 
an heretical arrian 
bad in kind 
worse in mind 
sent of constantius with an army and band of souldiers to alexandria 
did take upon him as bishop of that city 
who when he was most cruelly murdered of the heathens under julian the apostata 
and his body burnt with fire 
and his ashes cast into the sea 
lest he should be honorably buried of the christians as a martyr 
he began afterwards to be worshiped of some for a martyr unworthy 
as epiphanius 
reproving them 
teacheth 
and in progress of time the passion of george composed 
and divulged of his followers 
so deceived many 
that gelasius also 
although he did smell this deceit 
yet thought him to be an holy martyr 
not without probable reason 
seeing the passions of others 
who were truely martyrs 
were falsly written of other hereticks in like manner 
but when the romane synod 
in which gelasius insinuates that the romane church so thought 
was held nigh an hundred years after the other sentence given of athanasius 
nazianzene 
and epiphanius 
gelasius doth not affirm that george was also accounted for a saint in the judgement of the romane church 
much less of the universal church nay 
if it be exactly considered 
both what gelasius thought that the passion of george was written of hereticks 
and of what hereticks the interpreter of gelasius hath observed 
that to be done 
it will manifestly appear that the universal church of bellarmine 
that is 
that the east and west being deluded of the arrians 
did worship george the arrian for a martyr 
for when baronius had shewed that it was found in some acts of george 
those very same that gelasius seems to disprove 
that he had conflicted with athanasius the magician 
that wicked author alluding to george the arian bishop 
the invader of the seat of alexandria 
and persecuter of great athanasius bishop of
that city 
which the arians called magatian 
and reckoned george amongst the arians 
out of which 
saith he 
it sufficiently appears that that whole fable was the device of the ariansapud

but now pasicrates 
who writes that he was the servant of george 
and simeon metaphrastes 
in the history which lippomannus saith was approved by the testimonie of the eastern church 
where it is recited every year 
being brought into an abridgement 
they attribute to george a conflict with athanasius the magician 
the same do the western 
vincentius belvacensis 
and antonius 
moreover bede reporteth that he suffered under datian 
the most potent king of the persians 
who ruled over seventy kings 
over seventy five saith the arian fable 
as baronius witnesseth 
but it is one and the same dream 
and the steps of this are found in others amongst the eastern more clearly 
who make mention that he suffered in persis 
and some under datian 
amongst the western more obscure 
who change the name of datian into dioclecian 
to this may be added that both of them make their george a cappadocian 
in the east pasicrates 
metaphrastes 
nicephorus 
and menologium graecorum 
in the west 
varaginensis 
vincentius 
antonius and brevia sarisburiense 
but no author worthy credit doth make mention of any george cappadox a martyr 
but of the arian 
so that this one circumstance 
to omit the other of datian and athanasius the magician 
doth sufficiently prove 
that george 
whom the universal church of bellarmine doth worship 
was not an holy 
but an arian martyr 
to the probability of which opinion 
this addeth somewhat 
that the alexandrians have an old and ruinous church 
of the martyr great saint george 
without the city 
at the shore of the salt sea 
built 
as it is probable 
in that very place 
where the body of george cappadox was burned 
as the story relates 
and his ashes cast into the sea 
hiopplitus is another saint that the papists invocate 
who as he is commonly painted 
was torn in pieces of horses 
but that there was never any such saint 
the silence of authors worthy credit doth cry aloud 
for prudentius an antient 
and i know not whether the first author of that thing 
seems to have played after a poetical manner 
as he is reproved of bellarmine to have done in a greater matter 
and to have fitted his poetical fiction for the etymology of the name to hippolitus presbyter of antioch 
certes baronius noteth out of the romane martyrologe 
that this hippolitus was not torn with horses 
but taken away by an ordinary kind of punishment 
but baronius addeth that prudentius did blow three hippolitus's into one 
and that amongst them there was a souldier 
who was torn in pieces of wild horses 
but out of what author doth baronius prove this 
out of the acts of saint laurentius 
in which 
as he affirms 
there are many things apocrypha 
and many things contrary to the truth 
so thou wilt say 
as they are found in surius 
as metaphrastes hath published his acts in greek 
taken out of the antient monuments of the grecians 
as baronius adjoineth 
but how doth baronius know that they are taken out of the antient monuments of the grecians by metaphrastes 
whom he doth so often pronounce to have mingled many forgeries 
and monstrous lies 
and sundry meer dotages 
nay 
how durst he to praise those things as drawn our of antient monuments 
which he knows do bewray a later author by their vainity 
for in those acts decius the emperor sitting in his tribunal

but baronius doth evince out of cyprian and other sufficient witnesses 
that laurentius suffered under valerian 
seven or eight years after the death of decius 
and of the same acts of laurentius in metaphrastes 
baronius forgetting that he had said that he had taken them out of the antient monuments of the grecians

christopher is acknowledged for a saint amongst the papists 
whom they feign to be a man of gyant-like stature 
twelve cubits high 
who leaning upon a long staffe 
carried christ over a dangerous river upon his shoulders 
but the papists themselves confess that this is feigned 
baronius somewhat doubting 
saith 
he knows not what to say concerning that huge stature 
wherewith he is wont to be painted 
yet so as he doth insinuate that it ought to be reckoned amongst symbolical pictures by his praising of vida 
who interprets it allegorically 
and by the mention of george 
but villavincentius for certain affirms 
that it is doubtful to no man 
that this picture was properly devised of the fathers to this use 
that it might shadow forth a preacher of the gospel 
therefore 
although that there was a martyr named christopher 
yet how could his memory be ever famous 
as bellarmine affirms it was 
whom authors not ancient do report to have suffered under king dagnus 
in i know not what samos 
or city of cicilia 
or lycia 
so absurdly and besides the credit of all antient monuments 
that baronius is compelled to substitute decius the emperor for king dagnus 
out of how famous and rich author i dispute not 
so that if we grant that our christopher was a martyr 
yet it cannot be proved that there was such a christopher as the papists worship 
who was of a giantlike height 
whose patronage they desire because he deserved to carry christ on his shoulders 
katharine as the tale goeth was a virgin of alexandria 
daughter of king costus 
who was beheaded of maxentius 
when she could not be drawn from the faith of christ by fifty philosophers 
which he had used for this purpose 
this woman is worshiped as a martyr 
but it cannot be proved that there ever was any such 
there was no king costus any more then king dagnus 
the romane missale hath reformed this circumstance 
it was so palpable 
but obtrudes the rest of the story upon the church for truth 
and to give credit unto it cites eusebius 
as if he were the author of that fable 
but eusebius hath nothing to that purpose either in that place or any other 
onely he hath that which doth rather derogate credit from the story 
because he teacheth that maximinus did rule at alexandria 
where this matter is said to be done 
not maxentius 
which is so manifest 
that baronius could not be kept back 
either by the authority of pius the fifth 
or the romane breviary 
but he saith the name of maxentius is to be razed out 
and in the place maximinus to be substituted 
go to costus and maxentius being blotted out 
hath eusebius the rest of that narration 
no 
he hath not so much as the name of katharine 
nor any note either of philosopher converted 
or lady 
or wheel 
or of death or carrying into the mountain of sinai 
eusebius writeth that there was amongst the women of alexandria 
a christian woman renowned for beauty 
nobility 
learning and riches 
but more renowned for chastity 
unchastly and impotently loved of maxentius 
whom he 
when he had in vain sollicited by many requests unto whoredom 
could not deprive of life 
being more overcome with love then anger 
but cast into banishment 
and spoiled of her goods 
baronius because he no where found any other footstep of the martyr katharine in all antiquity 
and the papists had erred grievously if there had been none such 
whom they worship with a double feast 
and by name do invocate in their litanies 
to whom god promised at her death 
as they tell us 
that it should come to pass that whosoever should celebrate the memory of her passion 
and call upon her name in what affliction soever 
should be heard 
out of whose neck 
when it was cut off 
they affirm milk to have issued for blood 
which they have amongst their reliques at rome 
whom in their mass they make a mediatrix between god and men 
and by whose patronage they trust to be delivered 
and they pray god 
who by his angels placed her body wonderfully in the top of the hill of sinai 
that by her merits and intercession they may be able to come to the mountain 
which is christ 
baronius 
i say 
least these and such like props of
popery should fall 
would have that chast woman mentioned of eusebius 
who was driven into banishment of maximinus 
to be st katharine

that she was punished with flight 
as christophorsonus translates it 
that is 
as musculus renders it with a word signifying the same thing 
was banished 
baronius doth expound as if eusebius had said 
thats he had escaped by flight 
maximinus being ignorant and unwilling 
and hence he infers 
that we must not think 
that maximinus 
who was so great and potent an emperor 
did cease to pursue after her 
but that being sought and found out 
she was crowned with martyrdome 
in which depravation of eusebius he had offended less

did offend perfidiously or extream rashly

wherein jacob desired that it might so be done 
as in many other places

2 
the antients are of opinion 
that the angel is not a created angel 
because he is joyned with god 
and the same benefit is craved of god and of the angel 
and the observation of some papists 
that the word angel when it is put alone 
is to be understood of a created angel 
is false and vain 
secondly 
they object that of eliphaz 
call now 
if there be any that will answer thee 
but it is not certain 
whether this speech be of holy men or of the angels 
if the first please 
the sense is this 
let saints whomsoever thou knowest 
be observed 
and see if thou canst defend thy self by the patronage of any one 
or whether thou canst find out any one 
whom so great calamity did oppress besides his desert 
but if he speak of the angels 
the sentence is thus 
call the angels and see 
if any of them will vouchsafe the answer which may be to thee an argument how base thou art 
who canst not arise 
i say not to the divine 
but not to any angelical nature 
and so it is an irony 
and the seventy translate it 
and the writer of this book 
speaking of godly men 
calleth them just 
rather then by any other name 
again 
they allege 
if there be an angel speaking for himjob

but angel in that passage may be a name not of nature but of office 
and signifie an inter preter of the divine will 
and by uprightness understand the equity of god 
which the prophet doth declare to man 
if it be understood of a created angel 
the sentence is 
as mercer hath interpreted it 
if to man thus afflicted there be one angel an interpreter 
to expound and declare to god his faith and repentance 
&ampc 
in the old testament the faithful prayed god to hear them for the merits of the patriarchs 
but in these and such like passages 
the faithful pray not to be heard for the merits of the saints 
but for the grace and mercy of god 
according to the free covenant made with the fathers 
but saith bellarmine 
the covenant of grace and righteousness of the saints is both alleged 
as remember david 
and all his meekness 
but in that psalme the prophet mentioneth not his meekness but affliction 
nor are these the words of solomon 
but of david himself 
who 
as by the eight first verses we may conjecture 
wrote this psalm 
when the arke of the lord was to be brought from the house of obed-edom to jerusalem 
2 chro

and when the obedience 
love 
or uprightness of the saints is mentioned 
it is for difference 
not by way of boasting of their
merits

praise god in his holiness

being deceived by the translation 
but none of them could ever wring any thing out of them touching the invocation of saints

there is who accuseth you 
moses in whom ye trust

therefore it is like to this 
they have moses and the prophetsluk

they produce also a two-fold example 
one out of the history of lazarus and the rich man 
where the rich man is said to desire abraham 
that he would send lazarus to dip the the tip of his finger in cold water 
and coole his tongue 
but nothing can be concluded from this example 
because it is that part of the parabolicall history 
from which they argue 
is not historicall but parabolicall 
as is manifest 
because the dead have neither eyes 
nor tongue 
nor finger 
and therefore nothing is signified by these words 
but that the torments of the rich man were so greatsee mald

that if he had seen lazarus 
and could speak unto him 
by this or the like speech he would have declared the greatness of his torments

than from the horrible perverting of the words of christ by his most deadly enemies 
to conclude 
that the invocation of saints did take place amongst the people of the jews 
moreover 
both these examples 
and whatsoever else can be alleged to this purpose 
it is refelled by this

yet they think the fathers of the old testament did not see god 
untill christ by his passion had unlocked heaven for them 
and had delivered them from limbus 
but seeing the saints in heaven be now glorified of god 
saith costerus 
it is meet they should be honoured of us on earth 
we accknowleg honour is due to the saints 
but civil 
not religious 
in kind the same with that which ought to be given to the saints living 
but different in degree 
as concerning the acts of honour 
there be some which may be given to men absent 
as praise 
imitation 
&ampc 
and these are due to the saints departed 
others are given only to them that be present 
as bending of the knee 
&ampc 
and these be not due to the saints departed 
they urge again 
if civil honour be due to vertue 
wisdom 
power and nobility 
then more than civil honour is due to supernaturall vertue 
the answer is plain 
civil honour is considered formally or causally 
civil honour formally 
that is 
honour indeed civil 
separated and distinct from religious 
may be from causes 
not onely civil 
but supernaturall 
as the faithfull honour one anotherluk 13 
not as men onely 
but as faithfull 
and therefore for supernaturall dignity 
again 
god 
say they 
promised honour and glory to his saints 
but when the saints are said to have glory from god1 sam

joh

it is to be understood of that state whereunto they are translated essentially glorious 
and not to be made to be had in honour 
or religiously adored of others 
abraham 
isaac 
jacob 
moses 
david 
&ampc 
are glorified and honoured of god 
whom yet none amongst the papists do worship 
they object again 
in both testaments we read that the living did pray unto the living 
as the children of israel did request samuel to pray for them 
&ampcjob 40 
but it is one thing civilly to request the living to pray for us 
another to invocate them religiously 
paul did intreat the romanes 
ephesians 
thessalonians 
colossians to pray for him 
but the papists themselves will not say 
he did religiously pray unto them 
the first is done from the soul band of charity 
when one doth request another 
the other by holy prayers 
or 
as augustine speaketh 
religious rites 
and acknowledgment of superiority 
for none is adored for charity 
but for omnipotency 
not for being simply greater 
but for infinite power 
they reply 
the saints departed do live 
in that part of themselves 
wherein they are to be prayed unto 
and make intercession for us 
true it is 
they live in spirit 
but we have no example 
commandement or promise to call upon them 
and although they live in soul 
yet they have ended this life which they had common with us
and with their friends 
who might go unto them 
nor can they hear us now 
in that part wherein they live 
if the saints on earth 
say they 
have known the secrets and thoughts of others2 reg

because abraham knew moses and the prophets 
but this last is taken from that part of the narration which is parabolicall 
and if it was from the history 
it would not follow thence 
that moses and the prophets were known of abraham 
whiles they lived here upon earth 
as touching daniel and elias 
it was according to their extraordinary vocation 
but the saints in heaven 
have no such calling ordinary or extraordinary 
why they should know our thoughts 
we deny not 
but god can reveal the particular acts of mortall men to the blessed spirits in heaven 
but we must judg of events 
not by the powerpsal 
1356 
but according to the will of god 
for god doth whatsoever he will 
the power of god is limited by his will 
but the will of god is known by his word 
but the word no where teacheth 
that god doth reveal our necessities or prayers to his saints in heaven 
if the damned 
say the rhemists 
had care of their friends alive 
how and for what cause soever 
much more have the saints and saved persons 
and if those in hell have means to express their cogitations and desires 
and to be understood of abraham so farre distant both by place and condition 
much rather may the living pray to the saints 
and be heard by them 
betwixt earth 
that is to say 
the church militant and heaven 
being continuall passage of souls 
but the evidence of truth might have moved them easily to understand 
that this dialogue between abraham and the rich glutton 
is of things not done 
but represented of our saviour christ 
for the better and more commodious setting forth of the estate of the godly and of the wicked after this life 
and they might do well to let us understand when this new religion entred into damned souls in hell 
that they should have care of the salvation of their kinsfolks in earth 
when they went to hell they were void of charity and care that way 
and if hell be such a school-house of charity 
that they learn that there of the devils 
which they never learned on earth of moses and the prophets 
it were somewhat strange 
further 
if hell be a place of darkness and ignorance 
where is it 
and by what glass 
and by mean of what light 
that the gluttons soul knoweth abrahams and lazarus soul 
which knew not them before it entred into hell 
they are wont to say 
that the departed saints set all in the reflection of the beames of gods majesty 
in whose presence they be 
will they say 
that the souls in hell have the same knowledg by touting into the devill 
they seek to excuse themselves 
that they pray unto the saints 
not as god the creatour 
but as the friends of god 
but this caution is not wary 
because the protestation is contrary to their fact 
for by this very fact 
that they call upon the saints 
as they that knew our thoughts 
and can discerne sincere and upright sighes from counterfeit 
they shew they do in part call upon the saints 
as they that exceed the condition of a creature 
and partake that gloryisa 
428 
which god denies that he will communicate to any man 
for as in wedlock companying together 
so is religious invocation in divine worship 
but as a woman lying with another man 
if she should defend her self 
with this 
that she doth not company with him as with her husband 
but with an inferiour affection 
doth not thereby wipe away the fault 
but adde the crime of impudency to unchastity 
so do the papists 
no whit lessen their sinne of spiritual adultery 
that they say they perform religious invocation to the saints not as to god 
but as to the friends of god 
but at least they endeavour to shew 
that the invocation of the saints doth nothing derogate from the glory of christ our mediatour 
because they acknowledg christ to be our immediate mediatour 
who doth offer up our prayers to god 
but the saints
thus would have to be intercessors unto christ for us 
but hereby they diminish the glory of christ 
for they detract very much from his loving affection and good will towards us 
which the authour to the hebrews describesheb 415 
we have an high priest 
who cannot but be touched with our infirmities 
&ampc 
let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace 
moreover 
that intercession is not made subordinate 
as they pretend 
but collaterall 
in that they teach and believe 
that the saints did merit that they might be heard 
and also 
that they did not only merit to be heard for us 
but they merited power to conferre and bestow the things we ask 
not to mention here 
that whatsoever in the psalmes is ascribed to god or christ 
that is given to the virgin mary in the lady psalter composed by bonaventure 
and many other things of like nature

that the saints living should pray one for another 
and if it derogate nothing from the glory of christ our mediatour to intreat the prayers of the saints living 
nor doth it derogate any thing from him 
to pray to the saints departed to pray for us 
but this argument holds no proportion 
for praying to the saints departed 
we crave somewhat of them 
who be ignorant of our state and condition 
but intreating the prayers of the faithfull living 
we speak to them that be acquainted with our affairs 
they that intreat the saints present 
do attribute nothing to them else 
then that they can hear them 
with whom they are present 
but they that pray to the saints departed 
they ascribe unto them a power to hear our prayers absent 
and that in one moment farre distant one from another 
and different in the nature of requests 
which can agree to no creature 
moreover 
they intreat the present 
as fellow servants 
but the saints in heaven are prayed unto as mediatours betwixt god and men 
and if they pray unto them 
as they that merit audience 
even so they derogate from the glory of christ 
because that agrees to christ alone 
had pauls favour with god been so mightily improved by death 
as the papists contend 
and his affectionate notice of his followers necessities continued the same or greater 
his speedy dissolution or departure to christ had been as expedient for the churches which he planted as for himself 
but it was never expedient for any church or congregation to be deprived of their godly and faithfull pastors bodily presence 
as it was expedient for the disciples that christ should leave themjoh

the only reason of this diversity is 
because christ lives for ever

an exposition upon the lords prayer
chap 
i 
of the first part of the lords prayer 
viz 
the preface 
the things therein to be considered 
who is meant by father 
and who are allowed to call god father 
of the prayers of unregenerate men 
and how god heares them
question 
what are the parts of the lords prayer
a 
it hath three parts 
the first is the preface 
to stirre up our attention and teach ableness 
in which is declared whom we must pray unto 
in these words 
our father which art in heaven 
the second part is the prayer it self 
standing on six petitions and a confirmation 
which rendreth a reason why we pray to god alone 
because the kingdom which is all authority to grant our requests 
belongeth to him the power 
that is 
all ability to execute our desires 
is with him 
the glory 
that is 
all this honour of being acknowledged a fountain of good things belongeth to him a father of lights 
from whom every good gift descendeth 
who in this regard is only to be invocated 
the third is the conclusion 
in this word amen 
which is a testification of our assent and faith 
whereas the former petitions are testifications only of our desires
q 
what may be learned from this 
that our saviour doth not set down the petitions abruptly 
but first beginneth with a solemn preface
a 
from this practice of our saviour 
some reverend divines observe 
that he which is to pray to god 
must first prepare himself 
and not boldly without
consideration rush into gods presence 
and this without question is an undeniable truth 
for if a man be to come before an earthly prince 
he will order himself in apparell 
gesture 
and words 
that he may do all things in seemliness and dutifull reverence 
how much more are men to order themselves 
when they are to appear before the living god 
be not rash with thy moutheccl 
52 
psal 
268 
and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a thing before the lord 
david saith 
i will wash my hands in innocency 
and so will i compass thy altar 
o lord 
and this preparation stands not only in putting off our evil affections 
but even our honest 
and 
otherwise in their due time 
necessary cogitations 
as the cares and thoughts of our particular vocations 
house and family 
and a serious and conscionable stirring up the graces of gods spirit in us 
that we might come before him in holy and acceptable manner
q what things are to be considered in the preface
a 
in the preface is contained a description of god 
who only is to be called upon in prayer 
and he is described by two arguments 
first 
by the relation that is between him and his elect in christ 
which declareth his large and bountifull affection 
our father 
secondly 
by his absolute sovereignty 
majesty 
and glory 
which art in heaven 
in scripture when the lord is called our father 
usually there is some addition annexed 
as in this place 
which art in heaven 
and this description of god 
by these two arguments 
the one arguing his gratiousness and readiness of will 
the other arguing his greatness and fulness of power to help all that come unto him 
is placed of purpose in the very entrance into prayer to strengthen the petitioners faith and hope of good success in prayer
q 
what may be observed from this preface in general
a 
1 
prayer is not a bare wish or desire 
as we usually say 
i would such a good thing might happen unto me 
or such evil might be prevented 
but it is the tendering of our desires unto god 
of whom we crave the fulfilling of our requests 
and when the psalms speak in the third person 
let god have mercy upon us 
the devotion of the mind is to be reduced to the second person 
lord have mercy upon usgen 
3314 
1 sam 
1616 
&amp 
2525 
for it is the phrase of scripture to speak to the person present in the third person 
therefore in what words soever the prayer be formed 
let the mind ever think upon 
and look to god 
that the desire and petitions be directed unto him 
2 no angels or saints departedphil 
46 
but god our father only is to be invocated of us 
what an unseemly thing were it 
that children should seek to servants in the house for supply of what they want 
and not to their natural parents 
so here 
it is gods will to be called on 
and so to perform that he knoweth we want 
and he is both willing and able to supply it unto us 
as for the angels and saints departed 
it is not certain that they hear our prayers 
or rather it is certain they know not our thoughts 
nor can they do any thing which they will not 
nor will they do any thing to which god calleth them not 
they are so perfectly conformed to his pleasure 
and attend his beckoning in all things 
but they are not called of god to hear our prayers 
we may argue from this prayer thus 
that which is a platform of prayer 
teacheth as perfectly who must be called on 
as it teacheth what is to be asked 
but this is a perfect form of prayer 
teaching fully what things soever may be asked 
therefore it teacheth us fully what kind of persons may be called on 
if it be objected 
that the sonne and the spirit are not expressed 
the answer isjoh 
173 
that the father excludeth all other persons that are pure creatures 
not persons which have the same singular essence with him 
for such is the divine dispensation 
that when one is invocated 
all are invocated 
3 
these words admonish us of our spiritual adoption 
and terrene peregrination 
we are the sonnes of god by faith in christ jesus 
but travelling in a strange countrey absent from our father 
in which estate we need his aid 
because we are strangers 
and
are assured of help according to our petitions 
because we are his sonnes 
4 
this also should stirre up love and reverence in him that prayeth 
he is inflamed to love 
who thinketh that he goeth to his father 
that he might conferre with him of things necessary for him 
and he is striken with an holy fear 
who considereth that his father doth sit in heaven 
as the chief governour of all things in heaven and earth 
5 
hence we learn 
that god is both able and willing to help us 
if he be a father 
he will not deny to his children 
what they ask according to his will 
if it be good for them 
if he be in heaven 
as the sovereign commander of this world and all things therein 
all things are in his hand 
and he can do whatsoever he will 
6 
this is an argument of thankfulness 
that god 
who is most glorious in majesty 
dreadfull in power 
immortall 
unchangeable 
higher then all earthly things 
should vouchsafe us liberty and leave to call him father 
and with confidence to lay open our cares into his bosome

otherwhiles this name is attributed to all the persons in trinity 
or any of them 
but oftentimes it is given to the first person in trinity 
as in those places where one person is conferred with another 
and so in this place it seemes to be taken personally for the first person in holy trinity 
who is the father of our lord jesus christ by nature 
as he is the second person in trinity 
by the grace of personall union 
as man 
by covenant 
as mediatour 
and in and through him the father of all the faithfull by grace and adoption 
which implyeth or presupposeth both regeneration and remission of sinnes 
thus the apostle conceived of god when he prayed 
i bow my knees 
saith he 
unto the father of our lord jesus christ 
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named 
and though such is the divine dispensation 
that when one person is invocated 
all are invocated 
yet the father is fitly named alone 
because the sonne hath the part of a mediatour 
through whom we go to the father 
and the spirit 
the office of a school-master 
teaching what to pray 
and as we ought 
this compellation doth not only contain 
that the father begat his sonne from eternity

what may be learned from this name that is given to god in our prayers
a 
1 
prayer is the familiar conference of the faithfull repenting soul with the lord 
his most tender 
mercifull 
and loving father in jesus christ 
who delights in the voice of the penitent 
is most ready to forgive our sinnes 
supply
our wants 
suppress our enemies 
and succour in miseries 
2 
in prayer it is necessary that we conceive of the true god in christ 
as he hath made himself known in the covenant of grace 
we cannot come unto god in our own names 
for we are all sinners 
not able to endure the tryal of justice 
or to bear the weight of his wrath 
our approach must be to the throne of grace in the mediation of our saviour christ 
who is the true and living wayphil

in whom god is become favourable 
and through whom liberty of access is granted 
god in christ is the object of christian religion 
which in every religious act must be apprehended as he hath manifested himself 
by this the prayers of gods church 
and the prayers of heathen are distinguished 
who invocate god as a creatour 
not as a father in jesus christ

by which the faithfull servants of god are set forth 
that they call upon the name of god 
prayer is the breath of faith 
whereby we are knit unto christ 
and receive the prerogative of adoptionrom 
816 
it is the spirit of adoption that teacheth us with affiance 
humility 
patience and submission to cry abba father 
4 
it is one thing to pray for admission into the state of grace 
that we might be accepted and received of god as sons 
another to call upon him as sons already adopted to the immortall inheritance 
but no man can pray in an acceptable manner 
who doth not truly repent of his sinnes 
and seek unfeignedly to be reconciled unto god 
the wicked cannot pray 
nor will the lord regard their cry 
if i regard iniquity in my heart 
the lord will not hear me 
no suits can find acceptance with god 
which are not presented in the name of christ 
but christ will not plead the cause of them that walk on in wickedness2 chro 
714 
if my people that are called by my name 
shall humble themselves 
and pray 
and seek my face 
and turn from their wicked waies

seeing ye hate instruction 
the spirit of supplications stirreth up godly sorrow 
and causeth the heart to beg pardon with sobs and sighes for sin committed 
he who would pray aright 
must not only confess his sin 
but also have a full purpose never after to offend his father 
for how can a child call him father whom he cares not continually to displease through his lend conditions 
he cannot do it 
neither can any father delight in such a child 
therefore we must call to mind our rebellions and trespasses against god 
and with the publican in heaviness of heart say 
god be mercifull to me a sinner 
and not this only 
but we must set down with our selves never in such sort to offend again

we come with reverence before our earthly princes

how much more must this be in us 
when we have to deal with the living god 
for this father is impartiall in justice 
that we have need to converse before him in fear 
again 
it is a ground of hope 
earthly parents will not deny their children good things 
much less shall god deny us his spirit 
and what ever thing is good for us 
our doubting minds must hence be reproved 
and strengthened 
how confidently do children come to their parents 
if we have a suit to a friend that is reasonable 
we will presume it 
how much more may we be of good hope in all our requests which we make to god 
let us draw near with boldness and confidence to the throne of grace 
further 
it is a ground of humility and patience 
children cannot plead desert of their parents 
neither will they think it much to wait their leasure 
how much more doth humility and patiene become christians 
when they be to present themselves before the lord 
6 
a christian must stirre up
the graces of gods spirit in him when he prayeth 
but he must trust in the grace and mercy of god 
not in the worthiness of his supplications 
for he must present himself before god as a son 
to be respected freely of grace 
not as a servant to be rewarded of desert 
the fathers love is free 
not merited by works 
we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnessdan

but for thy mercies 
if the servants of god make mention of their integrity at any time 
it is not to plead the merit of their works 
or the cause why they should be heard

1322 
remember me 
o my god 
concerning this also 
and spare me 
according to the greatness of thy mercy 
and as we must not trust in the strength of grace

so we may not despair by reason of weakness2 cor

unworthiness

or want of feeling comfort 
for god heareth our prayers

if the god to whom we pray be a father 
we must learn to acquaint our selves with the promises which he hath made in his word 
to quicken our hearts in all prayer unto him 
and thereby to gather assurance to our selves that he will grant our requests 
for a father cannot but must needs make promise of favour to those that be his children 
and therefore the children of god must diligently record what promises the lord hath made unto them 
the promises made to encourage in prayer 
are these and such like

prayer is not a work of nature 
but of the spirit 
a man of himself cannot call god father 
nor with confidence lay open his cares into his bosome 
it is the spirit that helpes us in our infirmities 
that stirres up sighes and groanes in the heart for grace and mercy

do not unregenerate men pray sometimes

there be that draw near to god with their lips 
whose hearts are removed farre from him 
but the groanes of the heart 
not the words of the mouth 
make the prayer 
a man prayes for no more then he desires with the heart 
and he which desires nothing prayes not at all

ungodly men may ask some things they need 
but never as they ought 
they ask not in faith 
with an holy affection 
they depart not from iniquity 
therefore their prayers be unfruitfull to themselves 
not acceptable to god

unsound christians 
as they pray in a sort 
so are they partakers of the spirit in some measure 
though not of the spirit of adoption to seal them unto eternal life 
for there be some common gifts of the spirit 
not altogether ineffectuall 
of which many partake 
that are not effectually called to communion with christ in his death and resurrection 
now in what measure these common graces are imparted unto temporary believers 
in the same they may put up supplications unto god 
but even these liveless 
superficiall 
wavering desires 
come from an inferiour work of the spirit in them

shewing 
what the word our imports 
that a christian may in prayer 
say my god 
and pray specially for himself or certain others 
yet so as that he must be mindful of all that belong to the election of grace 
how god is said to be in heaven 
and what is thereby signified
question 
what doth this word our import
a 
our is not onely a note of the joyning together of many in prayer 
when one man is the mouth of the rest 
but it importeth that common interest and fatherhood in god 
which the rest of the faithful have in him 
from which there groweth a communion of one christian with another 
so that they become brethren

is it not lawful for us in prayer to say 
my god or my father

in adversity we must not fear 
for our father will provide for us

otherwise the lord will turn away from thy prayers 
if one should give the king a petition 
and carry in his hand or about him 
some stinking savour which the sense of any abhorred 
could he think but the king would turn from him

wherefore peter exhorts man and wife to exercise all mutual love towards one another 
that their prayers be not hindred 
let us therefore labor to be of brotherly affection one towards another1 pet 
37 
should our parents know that we are faln forth with our brethren 
durst we come in their sight 
would we look for other then to be checked from them 
even so the lord will turn his back to our prayers 
while our affections are turned against our brethren 
how should he call god his father with affiance 
who will not take the child of god to be his brother in affection 
he that intirely affecteth the father of the family 
loveth the whole house and family 
in like manner the affection we bear towards our heavenly father 
must be shewed towards his whole family 
house 
and inheritance which he hath chosen

we must not 
because we pray alone 
be careless of joyning with others in prayermat

christ teacheth his disciples jointly to pray 
our father 
&ampc 
and hath promised his presence to two or three that meet together in his name 
look as if a single prisoner should ask us ought 
it hath his force 
but when all in the house lift up their voices at once 
it is much more piercing 
so in this matter 
which letteth us see how wide such are 
who will make light of praying with others 
they hope they may pray for themselves 
and like the old saying 
every man for himself 
and god for us all
5 
in our prayers we must be mindful of others as well as of our selves 
for as he teacheth them to pray 
and to say 
our father 
because they were more then one jointly before him 
so in this regard that he might make them mindful of all their brethren 
called or uncalled 
that belong to the election of god 
watch unto prayer for all saints 
not that we may not make a prayer wherein we must not mention otherseph 
618 
but because we must not fail at convenient times in the exercise of prayer 
to mention others 
as well as our selves 
seeking their peace with god 
we are members of one body 
and therefore must help one another 
and such as have learned love and mercy 
cannot but seek at god the prosperity of their brethren 
whose conflicting state they know by good experience in themselves 
wherefore we must stir up our selves to the faithful performance of this duty 
he were a graceless child that would never pray for his mother 
and we would think he would do little for us 
that would not lend us a good word here or there 
so when we remember not the church 
and will not open our mouthes one for another to god 
what love is there 
let us therefore frequent this duty 
not in word or shew 
but in deed and truth 
from the practice of this duty it cometh to pass 
that a christian man is like a rich merchant 
who hath his factors in divers countries 
so a christian man hath
in all places of the world some that deal for him with god 
that never saw his face 
who are petitioners for him unto god
6 
hereby all true believers are distinguished from infidels and unbelievers 
for they cannot call god father 
he hath created and doth preserve them 
but they are not children by adoption in jesus christ
quest 
is it not lawful to pray specially for our selves or certain others
a 
it is 
yet so as the mind may not depart from the beholding of this community 
but refer all things thither 
for though they are singularly conceived 
yet because they be referred to that scope 
they cease not to be common 
the commandment of god touching the relief of the poor 
is general 
yet they obey this commandment 
who to this end succor them that they know to be in need and want 
though they pass by others that are oppressed with as great necessity 
either because they cannot know all men 
or be not able to supply their needs 
in like manner 
they that in special words commend to god the necessities of themselves or others well known unto them 
minding with all the publike society of the church 
do not resist the will or break the commandment of god

and strengtheneth faith 
majesty without love may terrifie 
love without majesty may breed contempt 
but when they are coupled together 
the one allures 
the other strike with awe 
the glister of the pompe of earthly princes doth move the subject to all humble regard of them 
to all seemly submissness in their behaviours towards them 
and doubtless 
the not being striken with any consideration this way 
doth make us so loose and heedless when we approach to god 
again 
it confirmeth us in our faith 
that god seeth our wants 
is of strength and power to effect our desires 
is of unsearchable wisdom to know perfectly what is best 
and when it is best to help his children 
parents earthly 
who have large hearts 
have short hands 
though they wish us wellpsal

were it thus with our father

but when he wanteth not will as a father 
nor wisdom and power as a heavenly governour 
our faith is firmly underpropped 
gods glory is infinite 
his love everlasting 
his truth heavenly and perfect 
his power incomprehensible 
why then should we fear when we seek unto himrom 
1123 
he is both able and willing to graft in again the hard-hearted jews 
he is of power and willing to confirm and establish the rude and weak in faith 
how then are we to accuse our selves 
who know not how sufficiently to admire and adore an earthly majesty 
a mortall man 
and yet are so respectless of the high excellency of god 
how slow of heart are we 
that we are not raised up higher then these earthly things 
when we are to deal with our god glorious in the heavens 
why do we dread and trust in the power of man 
not awing nor having confidence in his power 
when the power of every creature higher then the earth 
is unresistable by it 
as what power of flesh can rsiest the least cloud from dropping his rain 
the least starre from sending forth his light and influence

let us therefore considering this heavenly glory our father hath 
grow up to more reverence 
devotion 
and affiance towards him 
3 
god can hear in every place 
therefore we need not tire our selves with going on pilgrimage to any speciall place to seek him 
for if we can but go to our hearts 
and lift them up towards heaven 
we shall find him

we may find him in the desert

5 
this doth admonish us to be heavenly-minded 
if we will have any conjunction with god 
for as he that would speak to the king at court 
must bodily move himself thither where the king bideth 
so we that would speak with god 
who dwelleth in heavenly glory 
above all this visible frame of the creature 
we must in spirit by faith move our hearts thither 
where he is 
besides 
where our father is 
there our countrey is 
and therefore as pilgrimes 
and strangers do long after their native soiles 
so must we after that glorious inheritance 
which our father in the heavens reserveth for us 
yea 
for as much as we have chosen god to be our heavenly father 
we are therefore to renounce all earthly things in comparison of him 
and to cleave unfeignedly unto his commandements 
the little child is never well but when it is in the fathers lap 
or under the mothers wing

or evils taken away

4 
if one kind or part of any thing be expressed in any petition 
all kinds and parts of the same thing are to be understood 
5 
where any good thing is prayed for in any petition 
the causes and effects thereof 
and whatsoever properly belongs unto the said thing 
is understood to be prayed for in the same petition 
except they fall out to be the express subject of some other petition 
and so when evils are prayed against 
there causes 
occasions 
and events also are prayed against 
6 
what we pray 
we ask not for our selves alone 
but for others 
specially our brethren in the faith
q 
how may the petitions of this prayer be distinguished
a 
for the number of petitions 
divines of good antiquity have reckoned seven 
making two of the last 
others of no less authority 
have not regarded the number at all 
some of the antient 
and many of the orthodox later writers have reckoned but six 
because the conjunction but knitteth 
lead us not into temptation 
and deliver us from evil 
together into one sentence 
but whether there be six or seven 
it is no matter of our faith 
and doth not deserve any heat of disputation to decide the controversie 
if we respect the different persons whom the matter of the petitions concernsjansen 
har

others divide them thus 
in these six petitions we ask either the end of our life 
or the means which lead to this end 
the end is either principall 
the glory of god in the first petition 
or subordinate 
our salvation 
in the second petition 
the means are either leading to the end 
or seducing from the end 
the former we pray for 
in the third and fourth petitions 
viz 
piety and sustentation 
the latter we pray against 
in the fifth and sixth petition

sin past and present

and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness 
and when he inflicted that judgment on aarons sonnes 
he said 
he would be glorified in such as come near him 
if he might not have it from them 
he would have it in them 
by sending such judgments on them 
as might be matter of his glory 
secondly 
we pray that god would make himself known unto all nations in and through jesus christ 
who is the image of the invisible god 
the engraven form of his person 
the brightness of his glory 
for in christ we behold the glory of the lord as it were with open face 
what we know of god by the works of creation and providence 
is little in comparison of that we see of his goodness 
mercy 
wisdom 
grace 
long-suffering 
and clemency in jesus christ 
and as god glorifieth himself by the revelation of his son 
so do the saints glorifie him in and through jesus christ 
to god only wise 
be glory through jesus christ for ever 
ʋnto him be glory in the church by christ jesus 
if any man minister 
let him do it as of the ability which god giveth 
that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ 
thirdly 
we ask of god to refrain the bringing of such things upon us 
which might make wicked ones take occasion to prophane his name 
for when god saith 
he will not pullute his name among the heathen 
by the utter extinguishing of his people 
he doth teach us that the giving occasion to wicked ones to crow against his people 
and himself their god 
is a dishonour of his majesty 
and therefore here we pray it may be prevented

that our affectons are not stirred and moved according to the quality of gods works and word 
and that we consider not as we ought 
the wisdom 
power 
justice 
and mercy of god appearing in his works
q 
how should we stirre up our selves devotionally to make this petition
a 
to say this petition feelingly 
we must consider 
first 
how necessary a thing it is that god should have his glory 
it is his right 
and if we yeeld it not unto himrom 
1136 
rev 
411 
he will be glorified in us 
for to this end all things were made 
we live 
move 
and have being from him to no other purpose 
secondly 
though this is so necessary 
yet how little god is honoured by us 
who are his 
he passing by us in many parts of his providence 
we not seeing him 
nor taking any heed to him in the things we do see 
not affected with fear 
joy 
thankfulness as they require 
little thinking on him 
not speaking of him to his praise 
not ordering our works in such sort as they might be to the glory of him our heavenly father 
it is god that hath formed us in the womb 
brought us into the world 
provided for us ever since 
spred our table 
protected us against all dangers 
laid us to sleep 
raised us up again 
dressed 
undressed us 
led us by the arms 
and taught us to go 
he hath given his son to redeem us 
revealed himself unto us in his word 
regenerated us by his spirit 
freely justified us from sinne 
adopted us for his sonnes 
and sanctified us unto holy obedience 
but we seldom think upon these blessings 
we prize them not according to their worth 
we walk not as becomes them that have received such favours from the lord 
how many waies do we take gods name in vain 
thirdly 
we must consider how our hearts are so poisoned with love of our own names 
estimation 
and that glory which is from manjoh 
1243 
44 
&amp 
5 43 
that we are altogether careless of gods glory 
hence it is 
that if we circumstantially so fail 
that it craseth our reputation in any kind with men 
it doth sting us 
but when we be faulty towards god 
we pass it over without trouble 
hence it is 
that if one put the least contemptuous behaviour upon us 
using a term of any disgrace 
it doth kindle coales presently 
but we can hear gods name dishonoured 
and not be affected 
and moved with it 
we had need therefore to pray unto god 
that he would heal this matter 
fourthly 
to marke how fearfully with wicked ones not yet called 
gods name is prophaned 
doth it not pity us when we hear that our friends have such servants as do twenty dishonest parts 
which will redound to their discredit 
did we see their giving no regard to their master 
rioting his goods otherwise then he commandeth
drinking themselves drunk in his cellers 
would it not grieve us 
thus that lord of us allpsal 
119139 
that master in heaven is used by those that should be servants unto him 
which if we well weigh 
we cannot but cry to him for help 
that those deluges of his dishonour might be stopped and diminished 
fifthly 
we should seriously consider how forward we have been to dishonour god in thought 
word and deed 
before our conversion and calling out of the kingdom of darkness 
were not our hearts set upon evil works 
did we not devise abhominable things 
were not our deeds sinfull and odious 
what good thing did we receive from god 
which we abused not to the dishonour of his name 
how contemptuously have we slighted mercy profered in the gospel 
and should we not zealously affect the glory of god now we be called to the participation of grace 
when in former times we prophaned his name very wickedly 
sixthly 
gods promises to such as seek his glorydeut 
3251 
1 sam 
230 
and threatnings to such as do otherwise 
he will honour such as honour him 
and such as despise him 
shall be dispised 
seventhly 
let us consider that this is no common honour which god vouchsafeth us 
when he commendeth unto us the care of his glory 
and doth so farre abase himself 
that he will make account of that honour which we give unto him 
and desire to have it maintained and kept safe and sound 
eighthly 
let us remember how great his wisdom 
goodness 
righteousness 
power 
and all vertues that are in him are 
which whosoever shall deeply weigh with himself 
cannot but be ravished in great admiration of him 
to praise and magnify him in thought 
word and deed 
these things pondered 
will ingender some more feeling when we preferre this petition 
lastly 
we have the example of christ our saviour 
the holy angels 
and many of the saints of god to incite and provoke us to glorifie god

or to give thanks for some benefit received 
secondly 
the chief thing that we are to desire 
is 
that god may more and more be honoured 
this is more worthy then all the creature besides 
the end is more worthy 
than that which serves to the end 
as meat and drink which serve to maintain the bodily life 
are not so good as the body 
so when all the creature and all the actions of us 
are to tend hither 
that god may be glorified 
it is sure that gods glory is farre more excellent 
which must make us seek that he be more and more sanctified of us 
it was joabs praise 
so to order the battell 
that his lord and king might have the glory of the day 
and not himself 
ought not all gods subjects to respect their god 
more then he did 
or could respect his king 
excellently spake joseph 
when 
that the honour of interpreting dreames might not be given unto him 
he saith 
it is not in me 
god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace 
in like manner daniel would not assume to himself the power of revealing secrets 
but saith 
there is a god who revealeth secrets 
these examples are for our learning 
so that we must alwaies say with the psalmist 
not unto us 
o lord 
not unto us 
but unto thy name give glory 
we see that servants of honourable personages they are all for their lords honour 
they will runne into books 
and out of good inheritances sometimes 
to maintain a kind of gallancy 
which graces 
as they think

shall not we to our great good honour our god

he also will glorifie us

let us seek his glory 
who will keep a servant no way to his credit 
no more will god let us retain unto him alwaies 
if we be so careless to him this way

till he made pharaoh himself and the aegyptians to know that he was the lord 
did not the lord make senacherib an example to all that should reproach the holy one of israel 
did he not abase the pride of nebuchadnezar 
whilest he vaunted himself in his glory and greatness 
for the like sinne was belshazar weighed in the ballance 
and found too light 
these things are registred for our warning 
that if we would not perish with them 
we should not sinne as they did 3 
no glory or honour should be given to any thing in the world 
but to the name of god 
further then they are instruments 
whereby we may arise to glorifying of it 
for god will not give his glory unto any 
no not to the manhood of our saviour christ 
fourthly 
it is a singular benefit of god to be admitted to the sanctifying of his name 
and as it were to set the crown upon his head 
and to hold it there 
especially seeing he is able himself to do it 
and when he would use others hereunto 
he hath so many legions of angels to do it 
yea 
he can raise up stones to that purpose 
ffthly 
when we seek this at god 
we confess it is god that teacheth and enableth us to honour him 
our children have no behaviours more civil 
to our credit 
which we do not train them unto 
none by nature understandeth 
none enquireth after god 
nor yet care to glorifie him as god 
as he is the god that teacheth us to profit in all points 
so in this 
the use of it is to teach us to referre all unto god 
that we do prosperously this way 
who worketh it in us 
not our selves 
as also to teach us on whom we must hang with conscience of our own wants 
that we may more and more be enabled this way 
sixthly 
hence we see what care we must have neither to dishonour god our selves 
nor to partake with it in others 
for so doing we seem to mock god 
and deny in deed 
that which we beg in words 
he that asketh his daily bread 
and is careless to get 
or save any thing
by some lawfull calling 
should deride and tempt the living god

arise o god 
plead thine own cause 
remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily 
forget not the voice of thine enemies

increaseth continually

holiness is the highest title of honour and glory that can belong to any person

great are the priviledges of the saints under this government of jesus christ 
they are qualified with eternall graces 
they are comforted with the daily refreshings that flow from the sense of gods favour 
they are confirmed in the assured peace with angels and good men 
they are estated into an everlasting inheritance 
they daily reape the benefits of christs intercession 
they often sup with christ 
and are feasted by the great king 
they live alwaies in the kings court 
in as much as they are alwaies in gods special presence 
they partake of the priviledges 
prayers 
and blessings of all the righteous 
and they have the spirit of god in them 
to unite them to god and christ 
to lead them in the pathes of holy life

come

when things concerning this kingdom are come in their being 
that they be revealed and come to our knowledg 
for without this coming also we cannot glorifie god 
in hallowing his name 
therefore it is 
that every speciall manifestation of christs glory when it appeares to men 
may be called a coming of his kingdom 
thus christs revealing some glimpse of his glory 
is called the coming of the kingdom of god with power

that he would powerfully accompany it by his spirit 
to bring his chosen from the power of satan unto god 
that he would give them pastors according to his own heart 
to feed them with knowledg and understanding 
that he would erect his own ordinances 
and establish an holy order amongst them 
and link them together in mutuall love and holy profession of the faith 
thirdly 
for the churches already planted we pray 
that god would supply unto them what is wanting 
and mercifully continue and encrease what good they enjoy 
that he would preserve purity of doctrine 
that the word may be preached purely 
freely 
with power and authority 
that the sacraments may be administred purely according to the institution of christ 
that the house of god may be governed according to the heavenly policy of that kingdom 
that comely order may be observed amongst the saints 
each man with all diligence 
patience 
meekness and zeal 
doing the duties of his place

the evil may be shamed

we pray also 
that the graces of the spirit 
with the fruite thereof 
may plentifully grow and encrease 
and that god would bless his people with inward and outward peace and prosperity 
that being freed from jarres 
contentions 
and externall persecutions 
that they may walk in the comfort of the holy ghost 
and mutually edifie each other in their most holy faith 
and to this end we pray 
that god would bless his church with christian religious magistrates 
which may be as nursing-fathers 
and nursing-mothers to his israel 
which may so govern 
that their subjects may live in all godliness and honesty 
which may rule for the praise of them that do well 
and for the terrour of them that do evil 
which may advance and defend the only one true religion among their subjects 
again 
we ask that god would furnish his church with ecclesiasticall officers 
who might both govern and assist according to his will 
men furnished with wisedom and grace to discharge their duties 
such as be of unblameable conversation 
ensamples to their flocks in good works 
whose hearts are set for the building of gods kingdom 
we pray also for schooles of learning and piety 
for they are the ordinary means to maintain the ministry 
and so the church of god 
a man that hath divers orchards 
will also have a seminary full of young plants to maintain it 
schooles 
they are as seminaries to gods church 
without which the church falls to decay 
because they serve to make supply of ministers 
and because paul may plant and apollos water 
and all in vain 
unless god give the increase 
therefore we pray 
that the holy spirit would work effectually by his outward ordinances 
for the building forward of them that be already called 
and the effectually calling of them that be members of the church by outward profession only 
as in the time of the law 
not the ark alone 
nor the mercy seate covered with cherubims 
but the answers from the ark given immediately by god 
were the undoubted evidences of his most glorious presence amongst them 
so not the externall sound of the gospel 
nor the bare ministry of the word 
but the powerfull work of the spirit in every man soul and conscience 
is the most evident demonstration of the same glorious presence in the daies of the gospel 
the mighty and wonderfull works of the holy ghost 
pricking some at the heartact

the evils which we pray against

the reliques and remainders of sinne which abide in the best 
the want of good means which serve for the furthering of the kingdom of christ 
as preaching 
sacraments 
and discipline

abuses in the house of god

he straight-way rageth against him 
and labours quite to overthrow him 
these and all other evils are to be lamented 
as we shall see them to abound in the world 
or in the church 
2 we bewail our dulness and sloth 
that we cannot pray for 
and desire the coming of christs kingdom with that attention we ought 
that we neglect in life and endeavour 
what we seem to desire in petition 
that we strive not to beat down the power of sinne in our selves 
nor to bring others to the kingdom of jesus christ 
nor to walk in love and unity with them that profess the truth sincerely 
when we make this petition 
nor submit our selves to bear the yoke of christ 
and to be guided by his laws
q 
what motives are there which might move us to the devout asking of these things
a 
first 
to consider the breadth of the devils kingdom and possession 
how potent and numbersome his subjects are upon earth 
where we dwell who could see the king holding some shire within his kingdom 
and enemies
spread like grashoppers over the face of all his countrey 
besides 
what good subject that loved the honour of the king 
could think on this 
or view it with drie eyes 
what true-hearted israelite was not moved to see david fly out of jerusalem with ashes upon his head 
weeping as he went 
a small company following him 
when the traitour possessed the chief places of the land 
and great troupes resorted daily unto him with shouting and great joy 
secondly 
we must weigh what glory it is to god 
and security to us 
when true-hearted israelites are increased 
as a prince-like diadem 
such is the multitude of well-ordered subjectsisa

&amp

prov 
1428 
in the multitude of people is the kings honour 
multitude of obedient children is the glory of parents 
the praise of a shepherd is the number of his flock 
in externall beauty the first temple farre excelled the second 
but in glory it came behind ithag 
27 
9 
because the multitude that resorted thither to worship god 
was greater 
thirdly 
we must consider the strong battell which this strong man armed 
the devil and his angels make 
hindering the entrance of gods kingdom nationally or personally 
to all sincere ordinances of god 
to all the more full conformity and subjection of those who are already converted from satan to god 
if the thief watch to steal 
will not the house-keeper wake to save himself 
if a city be besieged 
will it not seek aid 
and stand upon defence 
when satan and his instruments thrust sore against the kingdom of christ to overthrow it 
we must seek unto god by earnest prayer to be defended against their malice 
if our enemies be ever waking 
we should not slumber 
fourthly 
to observe what a deal of darkness 
and lusts of darkness remain 
like canaanites 
as pricks and thornes in us 
what communion hath light with darknessrom 
724 
christ with belial 
how should the child of god patiently endure to feel the stirrings of sinne and motions of the flesh within him 
heat and cold may agree in one subject and make a middle temper 
so cannot grace and corruption 
which mutually contend 
and seek to expell each other 
fifthly 
how prone we are to fall away and be brought back again 
and how farre we are from being fully subdued to god 
all creatures keep their course and standing 
but men renewed by grace do slip often 
seldom prosecute what they have well devised 
that which erewhile pleased 
doth now displease 
and good actions undertaken they cast away 
and contemn 
being conscious of our own weakness 
we should fly to the lord to be strengthened and supported by his might 
who only is able to uphold us 
sixthly 
what miseries we are here subject to 
what blessedness we want 
because the kingdom of god is not fully come 
the happiness of saints is not compleat 
till the kingdom of christ be perfected in this world 
so long as they be sojourning towards the heavenly jerusalem 
they be compassed with many miseries 
lyable to many assaults 
pressed with many infirmities 
encumbred with sinfull motions 
oppressed with manifold afflictions 
never in quiet till they come to heaven the place of rest 
in heaven their happiness is not every way consummate 
till the day of judgment 
seventhly 
consider how precious is the pearl of divine grace 
and how excellent the treasure of divine glory
q 
what are the speciall blessings for which we are to give thanks
a 
thanks must be given to god 
that he hath erected a kingdom of light contrary to the kingdom of darkness 
that he hath called us unto it 
that he doth continually preserve itmat

untill the time of happy deliverance 
we give thee thanks 
o lord 
god almighty 
which art 
and wast 
and art to come 
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power 
and hast reigned
q 
what conclusions may be drawn from this petition
a 
first 
it is god alone that can trample satan under our feet 
and dissolve the works of the devil 
it is he that must turn us before we be turned out of
the kingdom of darkness 
prayer presupposeth both want of that we ask 
and impotency in our selves to attain it 
or that it is out of our power 
again 
the strong man holds possession till a stronger cometh 
now who is 
of any other creature 
stronger than satan in such degree as to cast him out 
the papists give some place in this work to the liberty of our will 
but though it be true 
we turn because we will turn to god yet 
we will turn 
doth note 
not the principall cause 
but a cause subordinate 
working by way of free disposition 
which disposiiton it receiveh from god 
not from natural strength 
so 
still all is by him 
men turn not 
because they will not convert 
because here noteth the fundamentall 
radicall 
prime cause of impenitent not converting 
which the will doth by way of disposition 
which it hath by nature of it self unto sin 
but it is otherwise when we say 
this man converts to god because he will convert 
for here god is presupposed the principall agent 
man is a secondary and instrumentall 
the habit disposing him to do this 
being grace received from god 
not derived to him with his nature 
away therefore with papists doctrine which make the will of man in a manner almighty 
god offers grace like as a merchant setteth his wares to sell 
leaving it to our will whether we will buy or no 
were this true 
if you ask what discerneth me from another unconverted 
the answer is 
my will 
i by the freedom i had of will 
took that proffered 
which another by the same liberty refused 
thus by the doctrine of mans freewill the grace of god is trampled under foot 
and the pride of man advanced 
secondly 
marke who must strengthen 
confirm 
and perfect all things begun in us

he sanctifyeth us throughout 
and makes us perfect in every good work 
he confirmes us unto the end 
and makes us to increase and abound in that which is good 
even as the sunne first bringing light 
doth more and more subdue all the darkness of the aire 
till it come to full strength 
so the same god that first dispelleth the darkness of sinne and ignorance 
doth more and more perfect the light begun 
till it come to glory 
and as the same physician 
which first recovereth us from some deadly lingering evil 
must after restore decayed strength and cleanse a l relicks of sick matter 
by such diets as art adviseth 
so god 
&ampc 
what then if we see all weak 
ready to overturn 
many graces in a manner utterly wanting 
so weak they are in us 
god that calleth the things that are not 
as if they were 
is the beginner and perfecter of his kingdom 
thirdly 
that gods kingdom is but in part come unto us 
we see not all things as yet put under him 
many not called 
many enemies and evils unsubdued 
many works of darkness hanging about us 
which must comfort us though we find these things 
we could not say this prayer 
were there not enemies still opposing us 
in our confl cting course 
the kingdom of christ were not to come 
but already come 
if we were perfectly freed from the molestation of the flesh 
and the suggestions of satan we are said to be translated out of the kingdom of satan 
in regard that we do not voluntarily suffer under him as a lawfull king 
but unwilingly as under an usurper too strong for us 
or rather 
because he is begun to be 
and certainly shall be cast out 
now that is said to be done 
which a while is so in doing that it certainly shall be finished 
fourthly 
all christians must unfegnedly desire that god would shew himself the absolute sovereign lord god 
in setting up and establishing his kingdom of grace 
to the utter overthrow of his enemies 
and bringing of his elect in christ to the kingdom of glory

that the coming of this kingdom doth much tend to the comfort and security of every faithfull soul 
the way to heaven seems more easie and delightfull

and his assaults borne off with more ease 
when multitudes combine mutually to aid and succour one anotherpsal

the powerfull presence of god in his holy ordinances doth much glad and rejoyce a christian heart 
the prayers of the faithfull are the more effectuall 
and the ordinances of god more powerfull 
when many joyn in the same suits 
tender the same petitions before the throne of grace 
and the society of them that fear god 
is many waies comfortable and beneficiall to good men 
to the strengthening of their faith 
quickning of their grace 
setling of their doubts 
kindling of their zeal 
and encouragment in the waies of holiness 
moreover 
the elect of god 
till they be converted and brought to the kingdom of christ 
do lie under the power of wrath and tyranny of satan 
they that actually are beloved to be made heires of grace 
be yet actually under wrath 
till they be renewed by grace 
and grafted into the body of christ 
for these reasons then we must cry to god 
that his kingdom may come 
doth not every good subject wish the enlargement of the kings territories 
the rooting out of all opposites 
that set themselves against the prosperity of his kingdom 
so must we 
if we be true subjects to the kingdom of heaven 
did we border upon the turkish empire 
so that we were often forraged would it not make us cry to god for help 
and shall the devill still sinke us in our persons

sixthly 
every true christian must seek with his utmost endeavour 
that both himself and others be in subjection to god 
we should with david and jeremy bewail the aversness of others 
and rebellions they live in against god 
and like paul 
bemone the laws of evil 
which dwell in us 
&ampc 
if we desire that god would save us 
should we not heartily desire that he would rule over us 
if christ be our saviour 
he is our lord 
if he hath redeemed us from death 
he doth rule in us by his spirit 
the price of our ransome is already paid to the full 
but it hath not full effect in us 
till our corruptions be subdued 
and our hearts brought to perfect subjection unto the lord in all things 
how would a naturall subject grieve to spie in himself 
or see in others much falshood 
much rebellion against his sovereign 
so must we grieve that we and others have hearts so false and rebellious against god 
and not only so 
but we must endeavour to set up the sovereignty of christ in our own hearts 
and amongst others more and more 
how do men profess perfect conformity and totall subjection to men 
how do papists seek to propagate the popes kingdom 
they find out new words 
rather then his subjects should not be made up 
should not we stirre up our selves to seek the enlargement and building forward of christs kingdom 
this is one principall end of the preaching of the gospeleph

that the elect unconverted might be added to the kingdom of christ

we are informed to seek it with all our hearts 
we have no way of getting any good thing 
but by flying unto the grace of god in christ 
which is done by hearty supplication 
but our prayers must not be idle 
as though bare desires were all that is required 
seek first the kingdom of god 
seek the things that are above 
abraham is set before us as an example of this thing 
who did acount even the land of promise a strang countrey 
looking for and seeking after a city which hath a foundation 
whose builder and maker is god 
heavenly glory is the highest of all good things that are to be desired the pearl of inestimable price 
to be valued above thousands of gold and silver 
in this world we are but strangers 
heaven is our native countrey 
where our heart should be 
whilest in body we are kept here below 
would not an english man 
by any case exil'd 
much long to smell the smoke of his own native countrey 
thus 
if we be heavenly creatures 
we cannot but in desire aspire thither 
while we are here on earth as exiles and pilgrims from our heavenly father 
all creatures have an inclination to the place where they were bred 
and where they may rest 
the stone falleth to the earth 
birds delight in the woods 
heaven is the habitation and rest of the saints 
and an affection towards it is given to every christian that is borne of god 
this seeking of the kingdom of god implieth or presupposeth the knowledge of what it becometh us to know or to do about this kingdom 
or at least an enquiry of the way that leadeth to this kingdom 
look as a man seeketh
earthly things 
when he goes out to the cryer to learn of them 
and look as clyents seek their earthly inheritances 
when they go forth to advise with their learned counsell 
thus when we come forth to be instructed by the word of god 
which is the word of the kingdom 
we are said to seek this kingdom 
in those daies the children of israel shall come

and the children of judah togetherjer

and rooted in him 
we are truly said to seek the kingdom of glory 
earthly men seek earthly things 
whilst they get their title to that they shall possess hereafter 
made sure and ratified 
thirdly 
we may seek this inheritance of gods kingdom in getting something which we may shew for our right and title to it 
now this we do by exercising our faith in some promises 
by which god doth freely pass it unto us

are the only deed and instrument which can be shewed for title unto eternall life 
fourthly 
we may seek this kingdom in regard of getting our selves possessed of it 
which we do by this means 
while we labour to be enriched more abundantly with the graces of the spirit 
and by a sanctified course to draw nearer it and enter it here on earth 
men will not only get right unto the things they seek 
but they will endeavour to be possessed

the pearl of grace is one part of heaven 
what is glory 
but absolute and perfect grace 
what is grace 
but a lively sparke of glory 
grace is in proportion to glory 
as the suburbs to the city 
as the porch to the temple 
as a little sparke of fire to a great flame 
the further we proceed in grace 
the nearer we approach to glory 
yea 
the more we grow in glory 
why have we not heaven upon earth 
but for that our graces are imperfect 
fifthly 
we may seek it in regard of getting our title and possession made sure to our consciences 
thus we seek earthly inheritances 
not only to be seized of them 
but by strengthening our selves in them 
hence it is 
that we will sue our fines and writs 
which may in a manner after a certain time 
put an end to all claimes which may be made by any 
some few persons on just ground excepted 
so we must give all diligence to get those things ascertained unto us 
which we do chiefly 
while we faithfully lay hold on gods promises which promise our protection1 tim 
418 
as 
that he is our god 
who will keep us from every evil work to his heavenly kingdom 
while we get the spirit to witness to our spirits this gift of perseverance which is bestowed on us 
while we learn to die by faith 
and hold christ as the author and finisher of our faith 
and raiser of us up at the last day 
and the father who is stronger then all 
keeping us in his hand even by his almighty power 
as in a strong tower unto salvation 
we cannot be sure enough of earthly things 
we desire to see the bird in the cage 
and have all things so setled as there may be no question 
how much rather should we not content our selves with uncertain hopes of our heavenly inheritance 
but travell to have it setled on us 
and throughly assured to our soules 
sixthly 
we must constantly desire perfect immediate fellowship with god 
as the loving wife longeth to be with her husband 
and to injoy society with him 
so doth the christian soul to dwell with her saviour 
head 
and husband in happiness and glory 
it will be questioned 
whether it be lawfull for a christian to desire death
the answer is easy 
for death and departure hence by death is propounded as a blessing 
promised as a blessing 
and bestowed as a blessingapoc

now a christian may love 
and long after the one 
and therefore may lawfully desire also the other 
death in it self considered 
is an unnaturall separation of soul and body 
and not to be desired 
but as it is to the faithfull an end of miseries spiritual and temporall 
an entrance into life that shall never change 
there is great and good cause why christians should desire it 
many are the benefits that death brings to good men 
it freeeth them from the injuries of the ungodly 
the bitterness of correction 
the infirmities of nature 
the pain of labour 
the fear of death 
death is cured by death 
while mortality is swallowed up of life 
it delivereth them from the temptations of satan 
from worldly provocations and evil examples 
from sinne and corruption 
and from divine desertion 
it bringeth unto them consummation of grace 
perfection of glory 
the inseparable company of christ 
and immediate vision 
and communion with god 
for these causes a man may desire death 
but he may not hasten his own end 
a man may desire many things to be done 
which yet he himself may not do 
a man may desire the ministry 
yet may he not make himself a minister 
he may desire to have some malefactors taken away by the sword of justice 
yet being a private person 
he may not do it himself 
so a man may desire death 
and seek it at gods hands 
but not procure it or hasten it by any meanes of his own 
we may desire death 
but without impatiency 
that was jonas his fault 
we may not desire death as weary of gods work 
of doing or enduring what he calleth us unto 
we must submit our wils to gods willmat

that at that time was the greatest monarch under heaven 
it was the afflicted case of his poor brethren at jerusalem that pricked his heart 
and melted him into teares 
the godly have mourned when sion was in misery 
and it
is charged as a foule fault upon the ungodly 
that they are not grieved for the affliction of josephamos 66

be led into captivitypsal

or afflicted in any other kind 
for then the enemies of the church grow proud and insolent 
the solemne worship of god ceaseth to be frequented 
and such as openly professed the gospel 
are compelled to hide themselves in dens and caves of earth 
secondly 
christ suffers with his servants 
and is afflicted with their afflictions 
if saul breath our threatnings against the saints 
he persecutes christ 
what good subject is not grieved at heart to see his sovereign plunged into heaviness and grief 
it argueth want of love to christ 
when men have no commiseration of the members of christ 
being in want or misery 
in distress 
danger 
or extremity 
for it is not so much they that suffer 
especially when they suffer for christs cause

kickt or hurt 
and the toe is farre enough from the tongue 
or the heel from the head 
and yet when the toe or the heel is hurt 
the tongue in the head speaketh and complaineth as if it self were troden on 
such a fellow feeling there is between the one and the other 
that the one suffereth in the other 
and therefore the one speaketh for the other 
and complaineth of the wrong sustained by the other 
as done to it self 
in like manner when persecuters spurn against 
and tread upon christs feet here on earth 
christ their head cryeth from heaven to them 
why persecute ye me 
christ speaketh for them 
because he suffereth in them 
though our head be in heaven in happiness 
and his body here on earth 
yet hath he a sense of those infirmities 
that his body is here annoyed with 
though he be freed from all passion 
yet is he not without compassion

not to mourn when sion sitteth in heaviness 
and goeth in sackcloth 
argueth want of spiritual life 
sincere love of the brethren 
and a fellow-feeling of their miseries

the want of it an undoubted sign of death 
it is but a rotten limbe 
a withered hand 
or a wooden leg 
that feeleth not 
when the head 
or but the heel onely is hurt 
and surely those that have no fellow-feeling of their fellow-members afflictions 
are at the best 
but as glass-eyes 
or silver noses 
or ivory teeth 
that stand for a shew in the face or the mouth 
but afford little use 
and partake not in pain 
because they partake not of life with the rest of that body 
which by art onely they are set in 
or fastned unto 
it is no marvail if a peece of wood 
or glass

the chastisment of the church is a token of gods fatherly indignation

this renouncing of our selves is so necessary 
that christ will acknowledge none to be his disciple 
unless he first deny his own will 
howbeit because nothing is more hard then to renounce our own will 
because we are carnal 
and love our selves 
and our own too carefully 
we are taught to ask it of god that he will bring this to pass 
and give us power to renounce our own wills 
secondly 
we pray that god would not leave us to our selves 
our own errors and wicked desires 
i will keep thy statutes 
o forsake me not utterly 
i am a stranger in the earth 
hide not thy commandments from me 
incline my heart unto thy testimonies

turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity 
order my steps in thy word 
and let not any iniquity have dominion over me 
thirdly 
we beg the true knowledge of gods will 
so much as may direct us in doing well 
and guide us in every good motion 
desire 
and action 
for otherwise how shall we do it 
how can that servant please his master 
who cannot tell what he would have done of him 
most men will have books of statutes in their houses 
and if they be to deal in any great matter they will take counsel of their books 
in like manner men should acquaint themselves with the word of god 
which is the rule of righteousness 
according to which they ought to walk 
fourthly 
we crave increase of faith that might season every affection 
command every thought 
and subdue every passion into the obedience of gods will and govern in every action 
it is the will of god 
that we should live by faith in all estates 
inseparably adhering to every commandment 
and resolutely holding fast every promise 
though it be far above our apprehension 
fiftly 
we beg humility of heart and spirit 
that we might be ready at all times to submit our selves to the good pleasure of god 
seek ye the lord 
ye meek of the earth seek meekness 
seek judgement

integrity 
uprightness 
and sincerity is to be prayed for 
that they may be inwardly increased 
and shine forth in all our practice and conversation 
thou requirest truth in the inward parts 
paul prayeth in the behalf of the philippians 
that they might be sincere and withour offence till the day of christ 
it is the commandment of god 
that we should be intie and upright in all things 
but what he commandeth 
that must we crave of him by hearty supplication 
7 
willingness 
delight 
diligence and fervor in well-doing is to be asked of god 
that the heart being set at liberty 
we might be able to set upon that which is pleasing in the sight of god 
freely 
with chearfulness 
and without
delay 
thy people shall come willingly

we pray that god would give us grace more and more to renounce and die to our own will and works 
that he should continually kindle and keep alive in us a desire 
care 
and endeavor in all things to live honestly in our conversations and particular callings 
and strengthen us with grace more fully in all parts to obey him 
till we feel not our selves 
but christ thinking 
speaking 
working in us 
as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk 
and to please god 
so abound more and more

that with all boldness they may speak thy word 
lastly 
we pray that god would bring such as belong to his mercy from the snare in which they are taken to do the divels and their own will 
to do his pleasure and work in his vineyard
quest 
what considerations should move us to the more devout making of this request
a 
these three 
1 
the necessity of making this petition 
2 the great benefits of obedience 
3 
the miserable estate of them that live in disobedience
quest 
how may the necessity of making this petition appear
a 
first if we consider how most live in the open breach of gods commandments 
would it not grieve a good subject to see men trample down the kings laws 
and every one run upon his own head 
secondly 
if we think how many things daily we offend in our unfruitfulness 
which maketh us rather to be utterly idle and pick straws 
then gird up our selves to holy thoughts 
our idle light discourse 
our inordinate affections 
our trespasses every where 
and following our own lusts 
thirdly 
if we remember and call to mind what unsoundness 
insincerity 
partiality 
unchearfulness 
sloth 
coldness 
we shall find in doing the work of god 
we are dull in hearing 
slight in prayer 
negligent in preparing our selves to the sacrament 
inconstant in our purposes 
loose in our thoughts 
senceless under the burden of sins 
troubled at the sins of word or deed that break forth to our disgrace 
careless of what our conscience telleth us to be amiss betwixt god and our own souls 
fourthly 
how imperfectly 
and in a sorry fashion 
we perform our daily dutyes both towards god and one another 
what a deal of sin cleaveth unto them 
that we cannot perfect the things we desire 
fifthly 
our inconstancy 
which maketh us no sooner in a good thing 
but we are out again 
and as little birds leap from pale to sprig 
so we are out and in 
off and on 
and through sloth cannot hold out at these works 
which are a dead work to our unregenerate parts 
sixthly 
our utter impatience to think 
will 
do 
perfect in some sort 
and persevere in any good things 
and the strength of our natural inclination carrying us another w 
sence of want makes earnest in
seeking help 
the hungry belly will cry for bread 
he that feels corruption haling him to that which is evil 
cannot but cry to the lord for strength of grace 
lastly 
the manifold discomforts which the divel doth muster against us 
that he might keep us from entring into 
or continuing on 
in any good action

saved a chosen number of them

who because he rejected the word of the lord 
the lord rejected him1 sam

we must bewail the errours of our life 
who forgetting the word of god 
which should have been our counsellour and guid 
have often stepped aside after the imaginations and lusts of our evil and deceitfull hearts 
in many things we offend all 
4 
it is to be lamented 
that many times when we pray with the lips 
or slightly with the heart 
thy will be done 
in deed and truth we lean to our affections and lusts

let us go on unto perfection natural things in their manner long after the perfection of themselves 
light bodies are not well and quiet 
if they be not above 
and in their place 
an infant is still growing in the womb till all parts be perfected 
and when it is come into the world 
it resteth not till it come to perfect stature 
so that it may justly be doubted 
there is not truth of christianity 
if there be not a desire and longing after the perfection of christianity 
be perfect 
as your heavenly father is perfect 
in every thingmat 
548 
and every way perfect 
if the beginnings of grace be sweet 
what shall the consummation be 
if the first recovery out of sickness be welcome and delightsome 
who doth not long for perfect health 
can any man take pleasure in his defects 
i count not my self perfect 
saith the apostlephil 
31213

but i forget that which is bhind 
and strive hard forward towards the marke 
we must shoot at the highest mark 
though we take up our arrows short enough daily 
when we call men still on 
they think we know not what we would have 
do they not thus and thus 
&ampc 
but he that laboureth not to be better 
will grow worse and worse 
for who gathereth not 
scattereth 
neither is there cause why any man should object 
as if christ might seem contrary to himself 
when he teacheth us to strive to attain that perfection of angels 
which we cannot come unto but only in heavencalv

for it is not needfull when we pray that the earth may be obediently framed to the beck of god 
to examine and sift every man 
but it is sufficient by this prayer to testifie 
that we hate and are sorry for every thing that we see contrary to the will of god 
and desire that it were taken out of the way 
not only that it may be the ruler of all our affections 
but that with such cheerfulness as becometh us 
we may give our selves wholly to fulfill the same 
more plainly 
albeit it be confessed that we cannot in this world perform perfect obedience to the will of god 
yet notwithstanding it is required of us to take in hand to do it as well as we can 
and to pray god in the name of christ 
that by sending his holy spirit 
he would bend our minds thereunto 
and mercifully pardon whatsoever weakness remaineth 
for even then the lord heareth his children 
when according to his will they ask those things which here they cannot have 
and which he hath decreed not to make perfect in them in this life 
to wit 
when he doth increase in them the gift of sanctification 
so that they profit every day more and more in the
knowledg and performance of his will 
and as for the want of their obedience he doth not lay it to their charge 
besides 
the lord doth require perfection of us in the covenant of grace 
though he be pleased to accept of sincerity 
now what god doth require of us 
we must beg of him 
st pauls prayer for the church of corinth was that they might not do any evil2 cor 
713 
although he knew that no man liveth which sinneth not 
although he knew that in this life we must alwaies pray 
forgive us our sinnes 
it is our frailty 
that in many things we all do amiss 
but a vertue 
that we would do amiss in nothing 
and a testimony of that vertue when we pray that what occasion of sinne soever doth offer it self 
we may be strengthened from above to withstand it 
they pray in vain to have sinne pardoned which seek not also to prevent sinne by prayer 
even every particular sinne by prayer against all sinne 
except men can name some transgression wherewith we ought to have truce 
but things impossible must not be asked 
as it is for us in this life to do the will of god 
as the angels do 
first 
this particle as signifieth not the degree 
but the kind of obedience 
sc 
sincerity and uprightness 
but to ask and obtain this of god 
is not contrary to this decree 
secondly 
things simply and in themselves impossible are not to be asked 
but things in some sense impossible 
if we have respect to the decree of god 
may lawfully be desired 
now perfection is not simply impossible 
but in respect of divine dispensation 
not absolutely 
but during this life 
for god will give grace to them that ask it 
to do his will in respect of inchoation in this life 
in respect of consummation in the life to comenon enim angustis huju vitae spatijs circumscrebitur hujus petitionis effectus

therefore consummation is to be desired 
and the impossibility in this life patiently to be born 
consummation is to be desired in this life 
that we might obtain it hereafter 
for he that doth not pray for it now 
shall never possesse it at any time 
but it is one thing that we cannot obtain perfection 
another 
not to desire it 
for god will have us to desire it every moment 
though he will not give it in this life 
it nothing pertains to us to search the decree of god 
and what he hath determined to do 
when we have this rule prescribed 
that we should ask according to the will of god 
therefore we ought to subject our selves to the will of god 
and to ask those things that god willeth us to ask 
whether he hath decreed it or not 
in brief 
we must desire 
strive after 
and hope for continuance 
increase 
perfection of grace 
which in full measure we shall obtain in the life to come 
9 
in all sufferings that god shall lay upon us 
we must be patient 
cheerfull and constant 
the lord hath ordained 
that by afflictions his servants should be made conformable unto his son jesus christrom 
829 
it is set down as a canon 
that by many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of heavenact 
1421 
and this is a very principall use of this petition 
thereby to comfort our selves against the offences of afflictions 
and of this present world 
for when being spent with long sickness we pine away 
are contemned of most men 
suffer injuries and persecutions 
finally are tryed with a continuall cross 
then do we find how hard and difficult it is to say this from the heart

good is the word that thou hast spoken 
saith hezekiah 
it is a singular honour 
that god should call us forth to suffer any thing for his name sake 
and by our patient suffering his name is glorified 
there want not manifold examples to encourage us in suffering for the truth

but also to die at jerusalem
for the name of the lord jesus 
which the brethren at caesarea hearing 
held themselves quiet 
and said 
the will of the lord be done 
10 
in proposing examples for imitation 
we must set before us the best 
and such as we know to be good 
perfect and heavenly 
in following such examples1 cor 
111 
we shall alwaies find matter of humiliation 
when we see in them how short we come of what we should do 
how much we are wanting in our best services 
also looking upon them we shall alwaies have cause to proceed on 
and grow better and better 
for as yet we have not attained the mark 
heaven is the hope and inheritance of the saints 
unto which they are born anew and adopted 
into which they are admitted by grace 
and which they shall possess in glory hereafter 
good reason therefore that they should strive for perfection 
and accustome themselves to walk according to the policies of the new jerusalem 
what though they cannot be as perfect as their copy 
yet the better the copy is 
the nearer they may learn 
the more eagerly will they strive to come to perfection 
once man could have obeyed perfectly

q 
how must it be taken in this petition
a 
1 
some understand it of the spiritual bread that cometh down from heaven 
and giveth life to the world 
even christ himself the spiritual manna 
promised in paradise 
figured in the wilderness 
fore-spoken by the prophets 
shadowed in the law 
manifested in the gospel 
the reasons they render of this exposition are 
first 
this prayer is a compendiary sum of all the holy doctrine concerning god and our salvation in christ 
wherein it cannot be thought 
that he himself and our incorporating in him 
the root and basis of all good things we have from him 
should be omitted 
being that which he so presseth us to seekjo 
33 
&amp 
632 
&ampc 
and giveth the first place unto in all his doctrines 
secondly 
the methode and order of the petitions were not so natural 
to ask earthly benefits before heavenly blssings 
thirdly 
the analogy and correspondence of these later petitions with the former three 
for as they beginning with the great and glorious name of god 
fall afterwads to his adjoynts of the kingdom 
and honour 
so these begin with christ and regeneration through him 
the fruits whereof are justification and sanctification 
which follow in their place 
as the apostle agreeably hereunto reduceth the benefits we have by christ 
to these three heads 
and that in the same order 
regeneration the root and mother of the rest 
justification and sanctification1 jo 
58 
the two twins 
and noble pair that cometh from it 
there he three that bear record in earth 
to the soul and conscience of every true believer

914

1 jo 
56 
and blood purging and abolishing both the root and fruits of it 
which is attributed to the blood of christ 
and that is so to be taken in this place 
not for expiation 
is gathered by that the apostle said before 
this is he that came by water and blood 
that is to say 
not our justifier onely 
which all men do willingly imbrace 
but to sanctifie us also 
which men will not easily be brought unto 
fourthly 
seeing it is plain 
that by obtaining pardon for our sins 
and righteousness in christ 
which is asked in the fifth petition 
consequently we have all the blessedness that belongeth to it 
one part whereof is this 
to have all outward things 
as additaments and appendances cast unto us 
so far as god hath appointed them for our goodmat 
633 
and further then that 
we have no
warrant to desire them 
it seemeth not so likely 
that either our saviour christ would rent these things asunder 
and transplant one from another 
especially to set the fruit before the branch that beareth it 
or in so short a sum admit of repetition 
which must needs follow 
if being else where included 
we ask them here by name 
and this also may serve to prove 
that no defect or maime can justly be imputed to this absolute form of prayer 
though outward things come not within compass of the fourth petition 
fifthly 
the doubling of the article 
this our bread this daily 
sheweth it to be no common breadio 
632 
but a bread of some rare and singular qualityes 
the very like doubling of the article to that purpose 
we find in the self same argument 
the bread the true 
and most aptly is bread here taken up 
to express our spiritual conjunction with christ 
beeing that which to the worlds end must represent him in the sacrament of the lords supper 
sixthly 
the word translated daily 
which maketh all the doubt 
being never read but in this prayer onely 
and therefore of an uncertain signification 
is derived from  
not as it is expounded competent or sufficient for our nature 
that is 
for our sustenance and nourishment 
for of that signification of the word 
you shall hardly find any example 
as h 
stephanus in his greek thesaurus noteth 
but in that sense which the scripture useth it 
and never otherwise 
as it signifieth wealth and substanceluc 
1412 
13 
tit 
214 
from whence are derived two words of neer affinity 
here 
and  
one noting that 
which as the remain and overplus of our substance 
we lay up in store and keep for a jewel 
the other 
that which excelleth all wealth and substancerom 
95 
eph 
46 
ps 
11914 
which 
among many other 
is one signification of the preposition  
and so doth  aptly answer  
i rejoyce in the way of thy testimonies 
as above all substance 
and it seemeth that our saviour christ doth herein allude to that saying of solomoncant 
811 
if a man would give all the substance of his house 
for this love 
he would be utterly despised 
lastly 
it is not probable that in so heavenly compendious prayer christ hath taught us to ask any terrene or earthly thing 
this exposition is confirmed by the consent of fathers 
but amongst the papists themselves it is disallowed for these reasonscham

we pray give us this day 
as though we were forbid to beg for the morrow 
as it is explained in the verses following 
but the spiritual bread we may ask not for a day onely 
but all the dayes of our life 
2 we ask this bread as a thing necessary for us every day 
as it is manifest by the words 
our daily bread 
but it is not necessary to receive the sacrament every day 
3 
the examples of the saints 
the commandment of christ teach that earthly blessings may lawfully be asked 
if god will give me bread to eat 
and raiment to put on 
saith jacob 
give me neither poverty nor riches 
feed me with food convenient for me 
saith agur 
pray that your flight be not in the winter 
saith our saviour 
is any man afflicted 
let him pray 
is the heaven shut that it doth not rain 
pray and the lord will hear 
we are exhorted to cast our care upon god 
not for spiritual things onely 
but in all things 
making our requests known unto him 
but if earthly blessings must be desired 
it is most agreeable to reason to refer them to this petition 
the words themselves sounding so clearly for it 
if the desire of temporal blessings may be referred to any other petition 
it is indirectly 
not as the proper object of that petition 
and that to many as well as one 
the reasons alledged to the contrary are easily answered 
as will appear in the exposition of the words following 
2 
the papists generally 
and some protestants expound it of bread sacramental and corporal both 
their reasons bebell 
ubi sup 
first the lords prayer should be very imperfect and maimed 
if the meat of the body should be craved so diligently 
without any mention of spiritual meat 
2 
in the same chapter the lord doth prohibite the care of corporal thingsrhem 
annot in mat 
611 
therefore it is not probable he would teach us to ask corporal things onely or principally in this petition 
3 
the bread that here we ask is superstantial 
that is 
the bread that passeth or excelleth
all creatures 
but this reason fighteth with their opinion 
as it doth with the truth 
for if the bread we ask excelleth all creatures 
how can we beg corporal sustenance under the name of bread 
bellarmine maketh this objection 
and returneth such an answer as directly overthroweth the jesuites argument 
the word  saith hebellar 
ubi supra if we consider the sound 
doth signifie supersubstantial 
but if we consider the subject matter 
it is no more but substantial or essential 
that it may seem to be referred not so much to the excellency 
as the necessity of bread

chrysostom 
theophilact and euthymius in their commentaries upon mathew the 6 
do say 
to be substantial bread 
that is 
bread fit for the nourishment of my substance 
whereunto the ancient interpreter had respect 
who renders it daily 
that is 
what bread we daily need 
and whereas the vulgar edition in this place of mathew 
hath supersubstantial 
he answereth 
first there be many antient books of the vulgar edition who have not supersubstantial 
but daily 
as it is manifest that cyprian read it 
and the whole latin church 
which in the lords prayer 
which without doubt it took out of mathew 
hath alwayes prayed and prayeth 
our daily bread give us this day 
moreover as the greeks read  
and yet having no regard of the preposition expound it substantial 
why may not we latines read it supersubstantial 
that word may answer to word 
and yet without regard of the preposition expound it substantial 
add that when the vulgar latin edition doth render the same word in luke daily 
in mathew supersubstantial 
the word supersubstantial must so be expounded 
that it may fitly agree with the word daily 
but it will most fitly consent 
if by the word supersubstantial 
we say that bread is signified which is daily necessary for the nourishing and conserving of our substance 
finally 
supersubstantial may be the same that very substantial 
as superabundare is valde abundare 
in which signification supersubstantial bread 
and daily bread is altogether the same 
for therefore it is very necessary 
because it is very substantial 
thus far bellarmine directly contrary to the annotation of the jesuites 
but not the reason of the jesuites onely 
but that opinion of our adversaries is disallowed by maldonate 
for the reasons before laid down out of him against the first opinion 
to them that object as in the second reason above mentioned in defence of our adversaries opinion it is not probable that in so heavenly a prayer christ would teach us to ask any earthly thing onely or principally 
he answereth 
that christ intended not to command us to seek earthly things 
to which we are prone by nature 
but to instruct whence and how we ought to seek them 
for he teacheth us to seek themvis

not from earth 
as bruite beasts 
but of god 
as men 
not for all ages 
but for the present time 
but this is not an earthly 
but an heavenly precept 
and that so far 
that very few obey it though christ have taught 
thus this second opinion is sufficiently confuted by the adversaries themselves 
further their exposition may be disproved by these arguments 
first our saviour chr st 
who condemned vain repetition 
and by a form of prayer provided a remedy against the same 
is made here of the jesui es to fault against his own rule 
for that which is contained in the second petition 
they teach to be asked in the fourth 
secondly 
they lodge in one petition things of divers kinds 
and far removed in nature 
spiritual 
and corporal 
heavenly and earthly 
yea 
according to their dotage 
the creature and the creator 
which if they were well herbinged should not have lyen so neer together 
thirdly 
hereof it should ollow 
that he taught them expresly to ask that which he had neither institued 
nor instructed them of 
and whereof his disciples were utterly ignorant 
for the sacrament of the supper was not as yet institutediansen 
ubi supra 
and the sacraments of the old law 
they make but bare and naked figures or signes 
severed from the spiritual food that they represent 
lastly 
seeing it is also quotidian or daily bread
as they confess it 
it ought every day to be asked of the lord 
and consequently daily to be received 
if it may be come by 
unless men will mock the lord 
in asking that which they will not take 
when it is offered 
whereby first 
are condemned the elder churches which used this great liberty 
secondly 
they bewray their own sacriledge 
that make no shew of offer of it unto the people but once a year 
whereupon they may better call it their yearly 
then their daily bread 
thirdly 
they bewray again the foolish superstition of the whole clergy 
to whom it is accounted for an hainous crime 
if they consecrate the fryday and saturday before easter 
3 
the true and general received opinion is 
that by bread in this petition is meant all corporal food 
yea all things necessary to the maintenance of this lifegen

and separate betwixt us and his mercy 
it is necessary that we ask first the pardon of our sins 
2 
if order must be respected in these petitions 
we may say 
that christ did not will to follow the order of dignity 
priority or excellency 
as if the temporal estate of the body were more needful 
more excellent 
or more to be desired 
than the eternal life of the soul 
but of nature and infirmity 
as the natural life is before the spiritual 
and a man must have a being in nature 
before he can have a being in grace 
and a comfortable natural life is both the fitter subject for the life of grace 
and fitter instrument by which grace worketh 
and doth the will of god upon earth 
righteous life presupposeth life 
and to live vertuously it is impossible except we live 
the apostle in exhorting men to contentment1 tim 
68 
although they have in this world no more then very bare food and raiment 
giveth us thereby to understand 
that those are even the lowest of things necessary 
that if we should be stripped of all those things without which we might possibly be 
yet these must be left 
that destitution in those is such an impediment 
as till it be removed 
suffereth not the mind of man to admit any other care 
for this cause first god assigned adam maintenance of life 
and then appointed him a law to observegen

for this cause after men began to grow to a number 
the first thing we read they gave themselves unto 
was the tilling of the earth 
and feeding of cattel 
having by this mean whereon to live 
the principal actions of their life afterward are noted by the exercise of their religion 
therefore the petition wherein we are taught to desire corporal food 
is set before them that concern the good of our soul 
of this order we may give these reasons further 
1 
request to have a comfortable natural life and being upon earth 
doth follow immediately upon the request of doing gods will on earth 
because the dead cannot praise god 
and if a man be not gathered into christs kingdom before death 
there is no hope 
for there is no work 
nor deviceis 
818 
19 
eccl 
95 
nor knowledge in the grave 
wherefore because no man can do the will of god on earth 
except god give him a comfortable life upon earth 
this petition followeth next the other in a most holy order 
2 
it is usual in scripture 
that the thing which is least to be insisted upon 
is placed first in order 
before that which
is sometimes more excellent that having finished the less worthy subject in few words 
it might dwell more largely upon that subject which was more worthy 
so our saviour in one petition 
and in few words doth express the desires of a natural life 
but spendeth more words about the spiritual life 
in the petitions following 
3 
gods indulgence and yeelding to mans weakness might cause this order 
giving him leave to ask things more sensible 
thereby raising him to ask spiritualjo 
453 
gen 
2820 
as our saviour by curing mens bodies 
did lead them on to know that he could and would cure their souls 
letting it appear to them 
he could as easily say 
thy sins are forgiven thee 
as to say 
rise and walk 
in like manner 
men may by the experiment they have of gods power and goodness to preserve the body 
be led to seek unto him 
with assurance that he both can and will save their souls 
4 
in this petition christ teacheth us not to seek bread or things necessary 
to which by nature we are prone of our selves without any spur 
but whence and in what sort we ought to seek them 
for he lessoneth us to seek them 
not from earthhac petitione cavet

as bruite beasts 
but from god 
as christians 
not for all times 
but for the present day 
but this is an heavenly 
not an earthly precept 
and that so far 
that few have learned it of christ our teacher 
5 
it might be added 
that when christ teacheth us to ask bread 
he hath not so much regard of the bodie 
as of the soul 
for he cutteth off the greatest and most vehement affection 
from which the greater part of sins doth bud and spring

bread for to morrow

calleth the assembly that was next to follow  
in the seventy it is found used for the time to come 
and as plutarch in sertorio speaketh  
they went about all the houses in order 
or they went about from house to house 
so bread  may be adventans or adventitius 
which it sufficeth not to have taken once 
but which in this vicissitude of changing times 
had need to come oft every day 
and hereunto agree those compositions 
that hesiode calleth that victum  
which is sufficient and necessary for a year 
plutarch in pericles calleth that

it is translated by some superveniens 
that is 
as varinus interpreteth it  
that we attribute it not to our industry 
but to the gift of cod 
or 
that bread is not the principal thing which is to be desired in this petition

for there is no antithesis of words

that god doth give necessary food to his servants every day 
therefore we ask of god 
that he would not suffer our diary to be wanting to us this day

the reasons why this petition is to be made 
who must pray 
give us 
how earthly blessings are to be desired 
whether absolutly 
or with condition 
in what sense bread is said to be ours 
the difference betwixt the wicked and the godly in possessing outward blessings 
that it is both lawfull and necessary for a christian to lay up for time to come
question 
why is this ptition to be made
a 
1 
such is the frailty of our nature 
that we are not able to continue in health one day without these helpes 
and as it were props to uphold this decayed and ruinous cottage of our mortal bodies 
less able to forbear them then many beasts 
for seeing there was necessary use of our meat in the time of our innocency 
the necessity by our fall is much greater

and not only the care of spiritual things 
for our heavenly father knoweth that we stand in need of these temporal things

god will be acknowledged that it is he who giveth us 
whatsoever pertains to our daily bread 
and is angry if any think 
that he hath received them from any other 
and hath commanded us to ask them of him 
nay1 reg 
835 
it is great impiety to attribute the things which pertain to our corporal sustenance to our industry 
or to the creatures 
or to ask them of the saints 
4 
it is a great portion of piety to ask the food of the body with solid confidence of our heavenly father 
when the care of earthly things doth hinder many from embracing and following the truth of religion

we pray that bread may be given us 
not only that we may have what to eat 
but that what we eat we may receive it from the hand of god 
that the bread we eat might be sanctified unto us 
received without sinne

q 
how are earthly blessings to be desired
a 
corporall blessings no less then others promised in the gospel 
are to be craved with confidence in gods promises 
humility 
according to the will of god 
with that mind 
in that manner 
and for that end that god requireth that we might serve god and our neighbour 
not for ostentation or that we might spend them upon our lusts
q 
are corporall blessings to be asked absolutely or with condition
a 
we may desire corporall blessing 
because we are allowed of god 
but in the success of our petitions we must submit our selves to the good pleasure of godjudg 
72 
3 
who will not give these things if they be not good for us 
nor withold them 
if it make for his glory and the furtherance of our salvation to have them 
as for the words absolute and conditional they may be referred 
either to the thing desired 
or to the event of our desire 
in the former sense 
earthly blessings may be prayed for absolutely 
as god alloweth us to desire them 
but in the latter we must ask them conditionally 
that is 
we may pray for them in holy manner 
because the word of truth doth warrant us 
and the desire of them is engraved in the heart of man by nature 
that he cannot but desire them so farre as they be necessary 
but we cannot be assured to obtain the particular thing we desire 
because god seeth it good for us to lack what we lawfully desire 
to whose gratious disposition we must freely submit our selves 
now the secret purpose or determination of god to give 
or not to give 
is not the rule of our desires 
but the revealed will of god 
to which so long as we keep our selves 
we do well 
nor is it for us to dispute 
whether such or such blessings be good for us in particular 
but whether they be just 
lawfull and good in themselves 
whether god allow us to crave them 
and we be fitted to receive them 
for we must
walk by rule 
and commit the particular success of our suits unto the lord 
who knoweth better what is good then we our selves 
and will keep from us whatsoever might be hurtfull 
moreover 
temporall blessings are not evil in themselves 
but hurtfull to us by reason of our corruption 
and so grace it self through our sinne and wickedness is turned to our hurt 
whereas therefore it is usually said 
that temporal blessings are to be desired with condition 
absolutely spiritual 
it seems more plain and consonant to truth 
if we say 
all blessings are to be desired of god in that manner and order that his word alloweth 
and to be expected from him according as he hath promised 
that is 
what god hath simply promised to do 
that in particular must be looked for 
what he hath promised so farre as shall be for our good 
that cannot be hoped for further then will make for our good 
whether it be spiritual or temporal blessing 
wherein we must referre our selves to the wisdom of god 
and not be our own judges 
but in praying for outward blessings it is good to observe two rules 
1 
pray first for grace 
and then for peace and prosperity 
2 
pray not for temporal blessings alone 
but for grace with them 
and the blessing of god upon them
q why is bread said to be ours
a 
not that it is a thing in our power 
gotten by our industry 
or due by any right 
but that of the bounty and goodness of the giver 
it is made ours by deed of gift

so then by means of christ 
bread is called ours 
for god having given christ to us 
doth in him and by him give all things else to us 
it is ours 
and yet we pray that it may be given 
for it is ours when we receive it 
but it is of god who giveth it

and our ability will permit to succour them 
opposite hereunto is the bread of wickedness or deceit 
hid bread or stolen waters
q 
why are goods lawfully gotten called another mans 
and grace our own

a 
temporal riches are called another mans because we do not possess them with full right 
when in a small moment they may be taken from us 
or we from them 
and when we die 
we must leave them to other 
it being not possible to take them with us 
and also because god gives them to men not as their proper goods 
but as those which he will have to be dispensed by them 
there is a double right 
jus charitatis 
that belongs to the poor 
and jus proprietatis 
which belongs to the owner 
by right of charity 
so much as may refresh the poor in his necessity belongs to him 
though the propriety be not his 
but heavenly and eternal blessings are called our own 
because they cannot be taken from us 
and being obtained make us blessed 
they do ever profit us 
never forsake usdeut 
2324

earthly blessings are not born with us

the reason is 
because they are deceitfull

if they be not gotten by fraud 
they beget sinne 
if they be not taken from us in this life

q 
if they only that be in christ are lawfull heires of outward blessings 
how comes it to pass that wicked men abound in wealth
a 
wicked men possess outward things as the common gifts of gods favour and bounty 
for which they must give account unto his majesty 
but the godly enjoy these blessings as gifts of gods special love 
and part of their childs portion 
which makes the little that the righteous hath to be farre better then the treasures of many and mighty rich men 
as the mean fare of a poor subject with the prince his favour 
is much better then the large allowance of a traitour commited to the tower with his displeasure 
nor yet do we say that ungodly men are unjust usurpers of what they possess 
having no title at all unto them 
but as god of his bounty in christ doth suffer them to live 
so doth he conferre upon them those things that tend to the maintenance of this life 
that he might imploy them in some inferiour service that he hath assigned them unto 
whom he will call to a reckoning for the abuse of his mercy 
after they have run their course

cheerfulness 
and comfort 
that through the blessing of god we may use them with gladness of heart 
i know there is no good in them 
but for a man to rejoyce 
and to do good in this life 
and also that every man should eat and drink 
and enjoy the good of all his labour 
it is the gift of god 
9 
the sanctification of whatsoever is in our power 
and the blessing of god upon it for our use 
that it may strengthen our frail nature 
and by his providence be elevated to a supernatural use 
10 
the maintenance of what we have with the sanctified use of it 
that it might not take up our thoughts 
nor draw our hearts away from god 
for he must uphold our lot as well as deal us forth our portion 
he must direct to use 
as well as give the blessing 
otherwise it will steal the heart from god 
or become unprofitable 
we pray for grace to contain our selves within the care for the meanes 
leaving the events unto gods only disposition 
these things we beg of god in this order 
first 
for those who are gods 
but yet uncalled 
whether having abundance 
but without the title of inheritance 
or have neither title nor possession of any thing 
for many belonging to mercy conflict with extream poverty 
we pray in the behalf of these 
that god would give as a father to the one 
as children and heires in christ 
the things they have 
for the other 
god would be pleased by a new grant 
to furnish them with necessaries 
who have justly 
as we all 
forfeited all things 
secondly 
we who have something about us 
yet find want of others 
we wish that god would supply us so farre 
as he seeth good for us 
thirdly 
we who are called 
and have for outward things more then we could in modesty ask 
for god doth for his sometimes this way 
and other 
above that they can ask or thing 
we do beg at god to maintain these things unto us 
and we wish also that god would give us leave to use the things we have 
and that he would give us power to take a taste of such comforts 
which through his allowance 
we have liberty of conscience to use 
moreover we desire that with his blessing he would make them comfortable to us 
and that he would bless all means we use 
tending to preservation of this present life 
fourthly 
if we be in christ 
and yet poor 
having in a manner nothing 
we pray that god out of his secret love would minister to us 
and make the fruit of his daly providence a contented portion unto us 
be it never so little 
and finally make us see him by faith our all-sufficient god 
that will not leave us 
nor forsake us
q 
is it lawfull for a man to pray for riches
a 
in regard of the quantity of outward blessings to be desired 
they are either necessary 
sufficient and plentifull 
or abundant and superfluous 
the necessity of riches either respecteth a mans nature or his state 
the necessity of nature is 
that a man have things necessary to sustain and preserve nature 
as food 
apparel 
lodging and such like 
with which a man must rest contented if he have no more 
according to the apostles rule 
if we have food and raiment 
let us therewith be content 
and these necessaries every man is bound to desire and seek after 
both that nothing be lacking unto him for the preservation of his life 
and also that he be not chargeable unto others 
the necessity of state 
place or calling 
either respecteth himself or others 
unto the former is required that a man have not only things fit to sustain nature 
but to maintain himself according to his place and calling 
in which a greater or less proportion is necessary 
according to the dignity or meanness of a mans quality or condition 
and thus a noble-man hath need of a large allowance to maintain him according to his nobility 
and a king more to maintain his royalty 
in respect also of others 
riches are necessary either to maintain those wich are committed to a mans charge 
or others who are not under his
government 
for the former 
the father is bound to maintain 
not only himself 
but also his children 
the master his family 
the magistrate his officers 
of which a man ought have as great a care to provide them necessaries according to their several conditions as himself1 tim

and this provision of necessaries ought not onely to be for the time present 
but also for the time to come 
for the learning of which lesson the sluggard is sent to the pismire to learn providence 
seeing she in summer provideth food for winter 
neither ought a man thus to provide for his charge 
that they may have comfortable maintenance whilest he liveth 
but also that they may have a competency for their relief after he is dead 
in respect also of others who are not under our charge 
riches are necessary 
and that both for publique and private uses 
publique 
as when we contribute to all good uses 
which either respect the church or commonwealth 
to which purposes we are to extend our helping hand 
not only out of our supersluities 
but out of our necessities 
pinching both back and belly to perform these publique services 
private 
as when out of that portion which god hath alotted us 
we be ready according to our ability to relieve the poor who stand in need of our help 
the second degree or measure of riches 
is to have not only things necessary 
but also to have some sufficiency and reasononable plenty of them 
so as a man may have not only wherwith to hold life and soul together 
and to provide in some slender manner for his charge and family 
but also such store 
as that together with them that depend upon him 
he may live comfortably and cheerfully in his vocation 
and not only so 
but also may be enabled thereby 
to be liberally helpfull and beneficiall unto others 
and to advance their good whether it be publique or privateprov 308 
act 2035 
deut 
2811 
eph

and in this degree also riches may lawfully be desired 
first 
because the holy ghost doth account this plentifull estate in it self 
more happy then that of want 
secondly 
because god requireth of us 
that we be ready to perform those good duties both publique and private unto others 
in scripture we find many commandements enjoyning 
and exhortations incouraging us to give unto the poor 
and to do the works of mercy to those who need our help 
as also to give tribute to the prince 
and maintenance to those who labour in the work of the ministry 
all which manifestly prove the lawfulness of desiring and seeking this sufficiency of riches and convenient plenty 
so it be with moderation 
thirdly 
the lord in his infinite bounty and goodness 
hath not only created such plentifull store of these his creatures 
as are sufficient for necessitylev 
265 
deut 
282 
3 
4 
11 
but also for honest comfort and delight 
and hath in many places promised this store and plenty to those that fear and serve him 
the third degree of riches is abundance and superfluity 
when a man hath more then is fit for his place and calling 
or then he can or will imploy to any good uses 
and this desire and seeking of abundance is unlawfull 
not simply and absolutely in it self 
but by reason of our corruption 
as it argues distrust and diffidence in gods promises1 tim

and cares of this life 
and so that day come upon you unawares 
lastly 
we pray against that prophaneness which naturally possesseth the hearts of men 
which maketh them careless of their spiritual title to earthly things 
or whether they taste of the special love of god in the use of earthly things 
so they may have their fill of vain pleasure 
or injoy outward things as they stand in need

for the more comfortable service of god 
that they would well weigh the wants of others and of themselves 
secondly 
consider what a sweet thing it is 
to feel this 
that god of his grace giveth this or that to us 
if we sit at board with great personages 
if they carve us a bit and give it us 
the whole feast is not so sweet to us 
as their honorable remembrance of us 
all the creature is a deaf nut 
and no better 
if the lord be not perceived in it 
thirdly 
for such as have abundance 
they must consider 
how he that giveth these 
is the maintainer of them 
how easily god might bring the things they have to nothing 
letting riotous servants and children 
like back-doors 
bring down the house 
fourthly 
how many wayes god can keep them from being able to use or find comfort in any thing they take or possess 
if he send a scruple into the conscience touching the lawfulness of it 
if he send sickness 
deep discontents 
lingring after that we have not 
or otherwise if he should give us to such weakness in using any thing 
that we should breed our selves more bitterness in the end 
then we take comfort in the first tasting of them 
how little things put us out 
that for the time all we have is nothing to us 
fifthly 
we must consider how all things without gods blessing are nothingdeut

clothes warm not 
meats nourish not 
physick heals not 
labors prosper not to effect any thing 
which those well know 
whose false affianced hearts have been well whipped out of all the creature 
sixthly 
we must remember the singular use and benefite of earthly blessings 
and how many wayes our life would be irksome and tedious 
if we should be deprived of them 
nor are they profitable to this life onely 
but they are instruments of vertue 
furtherances of our christian course 
if used aright according to the will of god
q 
what are the wants which are to be bewailed in this petition
a 
the special things to be bewailed are 
1 
covetuousness 
a vice which is naturally engraffed in every mans heart 
it is when men over-greedily desire the things of this life 
and have their hearts so taken up with the thought of them 
that they cannot mind the things that concern the glory of godpsal 
46 
the good of his church and their own salvation 
this desire is unsatiable 
and men that have enough 
would still have more 
2 
diffidence and distrustfulness in gods providence touching the things of this life 
this appears 
when men are pressed with adversity 
for then they howl and weep 
and pierce themselves through with many sorrows 
and these two sins do oft carry men to the use of unlawful means 
and wicked shifts 
to satisfie their desires 
or supply their wants 
3 
unthriftiness 
that we have consumed or wasted the good creatures of god vainlyluk 
1513 
riotously 
to the maintenance of sin 
and the satisfaction of our lusts 
4 
hypocrisie 
in making this petition 
when we begge of god what we need 
but will not wait his leasure 
nor trust in his promise 
but shift for our selves by hook or crook 
when we desire our own bread 
but live by oppression 
injustice 
fraud 
cozenage 
stealth 
the sweat of other mens brows 
5 
sottishness and pride 
when we pray god to give us our daily bread 
but are puffed up with outward things as if we had not received them 
and in prosperity are so senceless and overly in prayer 
as if we needed not the blessing of god to
maintain our lot 
and make what is under our hands to be profitable and comfortable for our use 
if our barns be full 
and our tables richly furnished 
we pray so coldly for a blessing 
that it may appear we feel not the infirmity of the creature 
we find not want of gods blessing 
6 
unthankfulness for mercy received 
that we have not taken notice of the lords bounty 
nor looked to him by whom we are fed 
clothed 
laid to sleep 
raised again 
preserved in health 
strength 
and safety 
who doth keep us in our going out and coming in 
and maketh our way prosperous 
7 
unquietness and discontentment 
that by froward carriage 
unseemly speech 
sullen behaviour 
we have troubled them that we should have comforted 
and been injurious to them whose peace and welfare we are bound to seek 
8 
want of compassion 
that when we are fed 
we remember not them that want and stand in need 
lastly 
we are to be grieved and mourn in moderation for the outward miseries that lie upon our selves or other the people of god 
specially 
that afflict the church in general 
as war 
famine 
&ampc

so doth god the great father of all the family in heaven and in earth 
neither can any deal us a fit state but he 
for as the physician only can prescribe the diet

where a more sparing is expedient

therefore we read it was commanded unto them to bring of the first of all their fruits in a basket

moreover 
all our labour and watchfulness are unprosperous 
yea 
and even his own gifts also 
being good in themselves 
are yet hurtfull to us 
unless he pour his blessing upon them 
for the earth being cursed for mans sakegen

which the lord both in word pronounced 
and in deed declareth 
so often as he sendeth upon us scarcity 
either by drouth 
or by waters and hail 
if at any time it yeeld corne and other things necessary for life 
there is no wise man but seeth that these things proceed not from mans travell 
but from the special blessing of god

he will be acknowledged the given of every good thing 
and it angry that we should think we receive them from any other 
love and praise is due to god for his mercies towards us 
but we cannot be thankfull for what we ask not 
what love shall god have from us for what we have received 
if we look not to him for what we want 
the sweetness of earthly comforts is lost 
when we cannot be assured of gods favour in them 
nor tast his special goodness 
and discern his fatherly care 
but the heart can never be certified of gods love and mercy in the enjoyment of these common blessings 
if it be not lifted up in prayer unto his majesty 
let every christian then assure himself that he may lawfully desire and pray for the things of this life 
only it must be considered of whom

if we seek the kingdom of god 
all these things for this life shall be ministred unto us

627 
the answer is easie 
for it is not said 
seek only the kingdom of god 
but first 
that is 
seek it chiefly 
and the promise of having all things for this life 
doth not exclude the lawfull means to get them 
but rather binds us with assured confidence to seek unto the lord for them 
thou hast spoken unto thy servant concerning his house for a long time 
therefore have i been bold to make this supplication before thee 
gods promise should embolden us to pray 
but not lull us asleep in security 
also the exhortation of christ in the last place mentioned 
is not absolute 
but comparative 
namely 
that of the two 
he would have them rather seek for that which is spiritual and everlasting 
then for that which is corporal and perishing 
notwithstanding these places 
or any thing else that can be objected 
james said 
the cause why men had notiam

it may be objected 
it is good to be afflicted

that he might not be poor 
that is 
so needy 
as to be destitute of daily food and clothing 
lest 
saith he 
i steal 
and take the name of my god in van 
yet 
it is most true which david saith 
but afflictions are good by accident 
through gods gracious working of humiliation and repentance by them 
of themselves they are not good 
it is no good argument to say 
afflictions work for our good 
therefore we may pray for them 
or we must not pray against them 
for the very sinnes of gods children 
through the infinite wisdom and power of god 
may 
and oft do 
work much for their good 
yet in no case may be prayed for 
but alwaies prayed against 
the prophet jeremy doth not pray absolutely that he might be corrected 
but as the case then stood betwixt god and his church 
sith god was forced to correct them 
he desireth that the correction might be in judgment and moderation 
as a fruit of his fatherly love 
and not in extremity 
as proceeding from his wrath and heavy displeasure 
the very words do shew this sense 
for he saith 
correct me 
but in judgment 
not in thine anger 
he doth in this place only deprecate the greater evil of punishment 
and willingly submitteth himself unto the less 
wherefore notwithstanding any thing that can be said against it

the least outward thing is the gift of gods grace to us 
all things come of thee 
o god 
and that of thy free goodness 
the earth is the lords 
and the fulness thereof 
and though he made it for mans use 
and hath given it to the children of men 
yet hath he reserved the right in himself 
to dispose of it to this or that person 
both what he pleaseth 
and as much or as little as seemeth good to him 
and when he hath disposed of any parcell of his goods to any men 
they hold them but as stewards 
to be accountable to him their master 
and are but tenants 
at the meer will and pleasure of him their lord 
the first grant of earthly things to man was of bounty 
much more the possessions of them since he hath forfeited his interest by sin and disobedience 
it is the lords mercy that we are not confounded 
and if life it self 
be given of mercy 
then all things pertaining to the maintenance of life must spring from the same fountain 
we cannot deserve one bit of bread or sup of water 
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies 
and of all the truth 
which thou hast shewed unto thy servant 
saith jacob 
nothing is more free then gift 
but whatsoever we receive we ask it on gift 
challenge it not as due 
he giveth meat in abundance 
thou givest them their meat in due season 
these are the children which god hath graciously given me 
such therefore as will challenge heaven by way of commutative justice 
because they have given a penny answerable to that penny-worth 
were never taught by the spirit of christ 
and considering that god of his grace is the giver of bread 
and of all other good gifts for this life 
this should move all men to get their names entred into his checkroule 
and become servants to this great master 
and being admitted to be members of his family and houshold of faith 
this should cause them to approve themselves good servants 
by doing their lord and masters will 
then may they be assured they shall want nothing that is good 
it is of this god and father 
of whom it is said in the parableluk 
1517 
his servants have bread enough 
and to spare 
it is therefore good serving this master 
who will alwaies either give much 
or cause the little which he giveth to be sufficient 
whosoever are good servants and children to such a master 
such a father 
how can they want 
for as he hath wherewithall to give 
so having commanded us to ask of him 
he will give to us liberally 
and never upbraid us with what he hath given 
and when we have received any thing 
we must accknowledg this as gods gift with all thankfulness 
if a friend give us our board but a moneth or two 
we think our selves much beholding to him 
how much then are we beholding to god 
at whose table we live of free cost all our time1 reg

let us seek our maintenance of god 
for if the lord do not help 
as the king of israel could say when there was nothing to be had either out of the barne-floor

or did attain them by hard labour and industry 
yet it must be acknowledged 
that gods gift of grace was in all these 
for who made our ancestours 
who gave them lands or living to leave us 
who did put it into the hands and hearts of our friends to bestow any thing upon us

david though a king

the lord is my portion

should be less trusted when he layeth down a substantial pawn 
would it be well taken 
this duty belongs to poor and rich

we allow them not without our leaves to do their pleasure with them 
besides 
god can keep us from touching them 
or finding any comfort in them 
though we use them 
or feeling his sweet grace 
as who is the giver of them 
wherefore let us take heed of the sensual confidence in the creature 
and fly up in spirit to him that giveth and maintaineth with us all things 
as the sunne which both bringeth and continueth the light with us 
let us not set down our rest upon things present

may justly expect that god will never hear him 
if we pray daily 
then shall we hold a gracious familiarity with god our father 
then will he hear us alwaies

when it shall be best for us 
it may rejoyce a christian heart to consider 
that he hath leave to come to god to preferre his suits to him every day 
nay oft in a day 
we are loth to put up petitions to men too oft 
lest they should grow weary of us 
and we troublesome to them 
but the lord is best pleased with them that come oftnest to him 
that crave most at the throne of mercy 
in courts of requests amongst men 
there are certain daies in which one mans suit is heard 
at which time other mens suits must be put off to other daies of hearing 
every man cannot have his suit sped every day

christians must depend upon god for provision and maintenance every day 
there be innumerable things 
which if they be wanting to us

and the infirmity of nature 
we must go unto our heavenly father

who hath his ears open to the supplications and cries of his people 
for whiles he doth exhort us to ask bread 
in that he doth promise that he will give largely to them that pray 
by teaching how we must ask 
he doth exhort 
by exhorting 
he doth inforce 
by enforcing 
he doth promise 
by promising he doth bring us into most certain hope of obtaining
ob 
but no man can reckon up the particular things he needeth
a 
when we ask things necessary according to the will of god so farre as we know 
god will grant unto us what he knoweth to be expedient 
though it be not asked in particular 
as god of his common bounty giveth to wicked men what they crave not 
so of special love he will bestow upon his children both what they beg and what they need 
though by reason of their ignorance they do not desire it in particular 
but if we obtain not our desires in things necessary for this life 
we must examine our selves 
whether some sin unrepented of do not hinder good things from us 
or we have not hurt our selves by sloth and lack of providence 
and upon serious humiliation we must conclude 
that what god doth deny to give 
is not good and profitable for us 
who hath more care of our salvation 
then we of our own
7 
as christians must pray 
so must they labour by just and honest means to procure the welfare of their natural life 
some things must be desired 
so as we fit and prepare our selves for them 
but must not labour after them 
but the maintenance of this life is of the number of those things that cannot be prayed for 
unless they be laboured after

poverty and want is threatned to him that laboureth with a slack hand 
plenty and abundance promised to the diligent

we must crave of god a good mind 
that we might wisely and justly use 
things well and honestly gotten 
god hath made us stewards of his blessings to be disposed to the glory of his name 
and comfort of our brethren 
which office cannot be discharged without his grace and direction 
the good things which we have gotten by our honest labour 
through the favour of god 
are not our own whollyprov 
327 
our poor brethren must share with us therein 
but to know what portion is due unto them 
and willingly to part with what the lord hath given them 
is a grace that none receive 
but they to whom it is given 
who do heartily beg it of the lord 
earthly things soon creep into the affection 
and steal the heart away from love 
pity and compassion 
if they be not kept out by hearty prayer 
and the heart framed to mercy by often and frequent communication with god 
the use of wealth is a work of grace 
no less difficult then the getting of it 
it is as hard to possess the world without pride 
coveteousness 
forgetfulness of the poor 
and security 
as it is to live contentedly in the want of things 
necessarily directing the heart unto god for seasonable supply 
to think we need not ask of god the right use of earthly things 
is to be grossly sottish of the state of our souls 
and extreme mindless of that duty we owe to god

we must not trouble our selves with distrustfull cares for time to come 
take no thought for the morrow 
for life it self is in the hand of god 
and we have no assurance to live till the morrow 
it is the good pleasure of god that his children should live by faith 
as well for the preservation of their bodies 
as for the salvation of their souls 
he hath undertaken to provide for them 
and they must look to him for it every day 
god liketh to see and hear his children oft in his presence 
and hath so ordered it 
that their necessary occasions should bring them before him day by day 
god looketh for new acknowledgment of his gifts every day 
and willeth that they have cause thereof by new gifts from him every day 
distracting cares are very troublesome 
accompanied with great vexation and fear 
disturbing the quiet and peaceable frame of the soul 
and taking away the sense and comfort of what we have for the present 
and torturing the heart with fear of what shall never fall 
now it is the gracious pleasure of god to free us from this carking torment 
that we might attend more comfortable imployment 
and casting off the thought of earthly things which
will disquiet 
give our selves to the contemplation of heavenly things 
which be full of comfort 
and surely it is much for our profit and comfort 
that god will have us to live at his finding 
and he will be pleased to keep our maintenence in his custody 
for we may be well assured 
if we trust in him 
we shall be well provided for 
and seeing it is his will 
we should ask our maintenance every day of him 
we have good leave and good occasion to increase an holy acquaintance with god 
by coming oft into his presence 
and speaking oft unto him 
besides 
if the thief 
or vermin 
or any casualty deprive us of those outward props of our life 
we may go to him boldly for more 
for if we depend on him according to his commandement 
he is by promise obliged to provide for us 
he hath store and great plenty 
and will furnish his children with sweet 
and good 
and enough 
it will not stand with his honour that his children should want 
no man under the sunne can live more merrily 
and more securely then gods children may do 
for they need care for nothing but to please god 
though there are many things for which they must labour in their calling 
yet there is nothing for which they need to care

when they had not one morsell of bread against to morrow

provision for the morrow 
this was because god sustained them 
but conscionable dependance upon god every day is no nurse to idleness 
no enemy to providence for the time to come 
which falleth within the reach of our daily course 
no opposite to thriftiness and frugality 
we are sent by the ant to school 
that we may learn in summer to provide against winter 
he that sleepeth in harvest is the sonne of confusion 
god would not have us superstitious capuchians 
who think it an offence to have any thing unspent over night 
nor prophane companions that sing care away 
and set cock-on-hoop 
whose money burnes in their purses till it be consumed 
nor yet foolish unprovident ones who buy their fewel when it freezeth 
but care of time to come 
which cometh from unbelief 
and desire to be greater then that we should need to care 
is that which the word condemneth 
care must be for the present

for a lamp with a little oyl is maintained

this natural life which the soul causeth in the body 
a mans prosperity is not in abundance 
for the dinne and tumult which accompany the expences which follow upon it 
are more irksome then that exceeding of one ones estate is contentfull 
a moderate estate hath more ease and comfort 
another more disturbance and ostentation 
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet 
whether he eat little or much 
but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep 
it is an old saying

yea

lest i be full and deny thee 
from thence doth grow confidence in riches 
high-mindedness 
and contempt of the poor 
the heart thereby is stolen away 
and wonne to the love of the world 
so much 
that 
either it keepeth men that they come not at all to the means of salvation 
or if they do come to the preaching of the word 
and sit with the people of god before the minister 
yet they do not profit 
because their heart goeth after their covetousness 
or if while they hear 
they begin to affect the word 
yet when they are gone 
the cares of this world 
and deceitfulness of riches choke the word 
and they become unfruitfull 
they that will be rich 
saith the apostle

and a snare 
and into many foolish and hurtfull lusts 
which drown men in destruction and perdition

it becometh a root of all evil 
causing shipwrack of faith and a good conscience 
of all estates a moderate and middle estate for maintenance 
is freest from surfetings of the body 
and temptations of the mind 
contentment and grace have best entertainment among them that have not overmuch 
but it is to be marked 
that not the having 
but the affecting of great things is sinfull

whn thou art full 
take heed lest thou forget the lord 
let us therefore bridle our inordinate appetites which know not how to say enough 
if we have but small things let us learn to be content 
and desire no greater 
for we must not desire earthly things as our goods 
but as our necessaries 
not as the only good 
so as to rest in them as the wished end 
but as helps and furtherances to the kingdom of heaven 
but how may we know what is a lawfull from an unlawfull desire 
first 
by their quality 
when they are vehement 
though about a thing that is good 
vehement 
so that they work a perturbation in us 
and put us so off the hooks 
that we are not our selves for the instant 
these are sinfull 
rachel might lawfully have desired children
but when it comes to give me children 
or i die 
to this 
that she will die of the sullens 
if she have them not 
this lawfull desire is depraved and become sinfull 
thus we know natural heat from unnatural 
the natural heat is so temperately dispersed 
that it disturbeth not the sweet content of natures constitution 
but these unnatural heats 
they make the part to glow to which they shoot 
and breed a tedious distemper 
so an ordinary desire doth not interrupt the sweet harmony of natures constitution 
but whiles it is kept in due order 
a man walketh not feeling disturbance by it 
secondly 
by the quantity 
for if they be excessive and unsatiable 
they are sinfull 
to have care of business 
is lawfull 
but when there is no end of it 
one draweth on another 
this is unlawfull 
so to take delight is lawfull 
but when men dwell upon it 
and unsatiably after one must have a second 
after a second a third 
this is gross sensuality 
so to take a cup of wine is lawfull 
but when one draught calleth on another 
one meeting another 
this is inordinate 
how is natural thirst known from unnatural 
the one is satisfied with a draught or two 
that more is not cared for 
the other is so kindled by drinking that it still desireth drink 
as it fareth in thirsts caused by agues 
heates 
and in dropsie-like appetite by salt rhewmes provoked 
thirdly 
by the object 
if they be carried after things unlawfull 
as to encrease our estate by fraud 
cosenage 
oppression 
thus when a womans mind standeth to ashes 
lie 
pitch 
raw flesh 
as such who do long 
are subject to these 
we know them to be unnatural 
because they are after that which is unwholsome 
and agreeth not with nature 
when she is in her right frame and temper 
fourthly 
desire is unlawfull when it is accompanied with envy 
malice 
grudging 
and repining at the prosperity of others 
whom god hath preferred before us in these things
15 
every daies prosperity and adversity is in the hand of god 
who is there that thinks he cannot provide food for himself for the space of one day 
if he be not able to do it for a long time 
but the scripture teaching us to ask our daily bread every day 
doth admonish us of our weakness to make preparation for our selves for any little space 
whatsoever we enjoy 
we must alwaies behold god in it 
and acknowledg him to be the absolute giver 
owner 
and maintainer of it 
whatsoever be taken from us 
we must still observe the hand of god in it 
who giveth and taketh away at pleasure

and doth note a gracious and free pardon of mercy 
in scripture many phrases are used to explain what forgiveness is 
as when god is said to cover iniquity 
put it out of sight 
not to impute 
or call to a reckoning for it 
to blot it out of his book 
not to remember it 
to do it away 
pass by it 
do it away as a mist 
seal it up 
cast it behind his back so that forgiveness is the pardon of gods free mercy 
when he himself doth freely cross out these debts 
and imputeth not the punishment thereof unto us 
more fully it may be defined 
an act of free grace 
whereby a man is acquitted from the whole guilt 
and is released from all the punishment of his sin 
in such sort that nothing can be laid to his charge 
in this act of forgiving 
allusion is made unto the acts of creditors to their debtors 
which stand bound to them in obligations to pay certain sums of mony 
or upon not paiment to forfeit a far greater sum 
now when the debtor doth make this forfeit 
and is no way able of himself to discharge it 
if the creditor doth forbear to sue the debtor 
and doth freely cancel the obligation 
and give to him an acquittance of that debt 
this act of his is to forgive 
it is likewise resembled by the act of a king and judge towards such subjects 
as by transgressing the law 
had confiscated their lives into the hands of justice 
now when the king of his meer grace doth remit the offence and punishment 
this is to pardon and forgive 
such an act as this 
is that of gods forgiving of a sinner

forgiveness is considered 
1 
as it is decreed by god 
who in his gracious purpose hath chosen some to life

2 
as it is purchased by christs death and passion 
christ sustained the person of all the elect 
in whom all their sins were virtually forgiven 
when he had paid the price of their redemption 
all the sons of adam sinned virtually in adam when he transgressed in eating of the forbidden fruit 
and all the elect of god were virtually redeemed in christ2 cor

as it is received by faith and conferred by grace 
for when the word of the kingdom is received 
the good thing promised in the word is received also 
now the promise of a pardon in christ jesus is received two wayes 
first 
slightly and superficially by a temporary faith 
which tasteth the word of life 
but feedeth not upon it 
secondly 
soundly and effectually by a sovereign and well-rooted faith 
which firmely knitteth unto jesus christ 
and according to this double manner of receiving the word 
there is a twofold remission 
the one inchoate 
which is not ratified in heaven 
because the promise is not entertained into an honest and good heart 
the other perfect and sound 
which is confirmed in the court of heaven 
according to that of our saviour 
whose sins ye remit 
they are remitted 
and whose sins ye retain 
they are retained 
whatsoever ye shall loose on earth 
shall be loosed in heaven 
and this sentence of pardon is considered two wayes 
first as it is passed in heaven 
when upon the presentment of the merits of christ applyed to the sinner 
believing in him 
through the operation of the holy ghost 
he is actually received into favour 
and acquitted from the guilt and punishment of former sins 
which sentence can never be revoked nor blotted 
this judgement is passed 
at what time the elect in christ have their names inrolled in the book of gods effectual calling 
and are numbred among the just 
for where the holy ghost worketh in us the grace of faith to believe in christ 
who was raised from the dead 
and applieth his grace and merite christ actually presenteth us unto his father 
who doth most graciously receive us into favour 
and freely discharge us from all our transgressions 
secondly 
it is considered as made known or manifested to the conscience 
which is a second act of the holy ghost 
wrought in this manner 
first 
when the holy ghost hath by the word convinced the conscience of the peril it stood in by reason of sin 
then by the light of the gospel he sheweth unto man a possibility of salvation 
and offereth forgiveness upon condition of believing 
then by the ministery of the same word 
he worketh faith in the
heart 
whereby we obtain and receive forgiveness offered 
thirdly 
being enlightned by the spirit 
through the reflexion of the renewed conscience upon it self 
we come to know that we do believe 
and that believing our sinnes are pardoned and done away 
thus the spirit shining about the soul 
the sentence of absolution is made clear to the heart of the sinner guilty in himself 
but believing in christ for mercy 
this sentence hath different degrees 
it is sometimes more clear in the apprehension of the soul 
sometimes more dimme 
yea 
sometimes quite blotted out in the counter-pane of our release or copy of our aquittance 
so that a person standing perfectly just before god 
hath little or no sense or apprehension of it in his own conscience 
5 
it must be considered in respect of continuance 
not only in regard of the new application of it to the conscience 
but of the divine sentence 
for pardon is vouchsafed of mercy 
as it is promised in the gospel and received by faith 
but god doth not promise pardon of sinnes past 
present and to come 
before they be committed and repented of 
nor can the believer by faith receive the pardon of them 
all divines grant 
that in respect of the pronouncing of that sentence to the heart 
it is not actually applied 
neither can a particular sinner be said to be every way actually forgiven 
untill it have been committed 
confessed 
and repented of 
but if sinnes to come be actually pardoned to the believer 
and that be promised in the gospel to be received by faith 
we desire to know why it may not be revealed to the conscience 
what is known by the word 
and apprehended by faith 
that may be known to the renewed conscience 
the word of truth hath never taught us so to distinguish 
and it is not for us to admit what we have not learned from it 
nevertheless 
we must not so conceive 
as if by every gross sinne the person justified did fall from the state of justification 
and favour of god 
but the state of the person sinning must be distinguished from the actual pardon of particular sinnes commited after effectual calling 
6 
forgiveness of sinne is to be considered in respect of the execution of the sentence 
for so long as sinne abideth in us 
and we be subject to the displeasure of god 
and temporal chastisements by reason of our offences 
the sentence of pardon hath not taken full effect 
if it be objected 
that the remission of the sinnes of the justified is full and perfect 
the answer is 
that the remission of the sinnes of the justified 
is full and perfect 
not for that they are already freed actually from the inherence of sinne 
and the displeasure of god disliking it 
but because they have full title unto 
and right in that mercy of god 
which as it hath already delivered them from the dominion and condemnation of sinne 
so it will in the end wholly free them 
from the inherence of it 
the displeasure of god disliking it 
and all the temporal chastisements that do light upon us 
7 
the full and perfect consummation of forgiveness is not obtained till the day of judgment when we shall be discharged openly by the judg himself 
before the tribunall of grace 
repentact 
319 
that your sinnes may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come

q 
how should a man stirre up himself to make this petition devotionally
a 
1 
the first mean of the more devotional propounding this petition 
is to work the heart to godly sorrow for sinne 
considering the filthiness of it 
our own indignity 
the tyranny of satan 
and the miseries that accompany transgression 
what is sinne 
but the corruption of the soul 
what are we 
rotten flesh 
the filth of the earth 
dust and ashes 
that we should dare to lift up the heel against the incomprehensible majesty of god 
of whom we are created 
preserved 
redeemed 
and enriched with incredible benefits 
and to what end do we offend 
that being estranged from god 
who is the chief good 
we might yeeld our selves unto the devil into most miserable servitude 
for the base 
filthy wages of sinne 
nor can it be spoken 
how cruelly the prince of this world dominiers in their souls 
who breaking covenant of love with god 
whereby our spirit is knit to god 
do revolt to this malitious enemy 
sinne violates the sanctity of the soul 
prophanes the temple of god 
innumerable are the evils which sinne hath brought upon man 
god himself is at warre with the wicked 
with whose ungodly acts he is greatly offended 
the wrath of god doth pursue the sinner 
as the shadow followeth the body 
those considerations should move us to mourn for the sinnes that we have committed against the law 
and if we can truly sorrow that we have offended 
we shall earnestly beg to be received into favour 
what will a malefactour now in danger leave unattempted to get his pardon 
2 
that the sight of sinne drive us not to despair 
we must remember that god is ready to grant release to them that seek it by hearty supplication 
for he would never have taught us to crave mercy by prayer 
if he had not been willing to pardon them that repent 
but if we hope stedfastly 
we shall earnestly and affectionately cry to god 
forgive us our trespasses 
what if one might be released from his debt 
but asking to have it forgiven 
who would not seek instantly 
who would spare to speak that have this hope 
3 
the third mean is to let our hearts smite us in the sins 
which of infirmity we fall into 
for because men pass by sinne impenitenly 
without conscience of it all the day 
therefore they without life and power and feeling desire 
propound this request to god at evening 
4 
to mark how uncomfortable it is when gods countenance this way is hid from us 
and how heavy it is when doubting and darkness do grow upon us 
5 
we must get a fear of gods fatherly corrections 
which we provoke 
the child that feareth the rod will be afraid and cry to have a fault pardoned 
so we must think what a joy and sweet state it is to have our quietus est daily by us 
the peace of god passeth all understanding 
there is nothing that can make us so comfortable to our selves 
nor so fruitfull in the knowledg of our lord jesus christ 
as assurance of salvation 
blessed is the man whose iniquity is forgiven 
and whose sinne is covered 
6 
consider the examples of the faithfull 
how earnest have they been with the lord for mercy 
how importunately have they sollicited him to blot their sins out of his remembrance 
and in loving favour to turn unto them 
their zeal should inflame our desire 
and quicken our dulness
q 
what are the special blessings for which we ought to be thankfull
a 
1 
we must bless god that he hath given christ to be our propitiation 
in whom we might obtain mercy 
at the birth of christ 
the angels sang 
glory be to god on high 
christ is the gift of gods rich love and mercy 
for which we are bound to render immortal praise 
2 
god is to be praised for his word and ordinances 
in which he hath made known what his pleasure is touching the pardon of our sinnes 
and giveth us assurance of his favour 
he hath not dealt so with every nation 
neither have the people known his law 
3 
we must give thanks to god for the pardon of our sinnes 
that he hath given us grace to humble our souls 
seek mercy 
believe his promiserom 
725 
and that he hath looked upon us in love 
removing our iniquities farre out of his sight 
who is a god like unto thee 
that pardoneth iniquity 
and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his inheritancemica 718 
o the incomprehensible mercy of god 
who sheweth himself so easie to be intreated 
men if provoked are hard to be wonne

and teacheth how to sue that we might find favour and live in peace

if a man be not in the state of
grace 
his prosperity in this life doth but fat him against the day of slaughter 
and increase of his daies are but a multiplication of his sinnes 
against the day of reckoning 
and he may look for death to arrest him every day 
which if it doe before his sinnes be remitted 
he shall be found in his sinnes at the day of judgment 
to his everlasting perdition 
if a man be in the state of grace 
yet if by new sinnes the lord be provoked to withdraw his loving countenance 
and to shew tokens of his displeasure against him 
his life becometh unprofitable and uncomfortable 
untill god speak peace unto his soul again 
he cannot come boldly into the presence of god to pray 
hear or receive the sacrament 
or if he do come 
he is very heartless in the performance of them 
and all that a man hath 
though it be a kingdom 
can give him no comfort 
but when god forgiveth sinnes 
god of an enemy becometh a friend 
and of a displeased father 
beginneth to look graciously upon his child the guilt of sinne subjecteth to the curse 
freedom from sinne bringeth deliverance from all misery 
they are to be held extremely foolish 
and out of measure sinfull 
that of all things 
care and look least after forgiveness 
and the making of their salvation sure unto them 
if they have offended 
and be in danger of punishment by the laws of man 
then 
if by petition 
or bribe 
or by any other means they can procure 
either commutations 
or releasment 
or pardons 
they will spare no paines this way 
or if they can make sure to themselves and to theirs large temporal estates 
it is all that they labour to make sure in this life 
but they are altogether negligent in seeking remission of sinnes by christ jesus 
they have no thoughts of making their calling and election sure

it belongs to god only to forgive sinnes 
and to restore the feeling of his grace 
to the lord our god belongeth mercies and forgivenessesdan

faith is given of grace

forgiveness of sinne is full and perfect in respect of guilt and punishment

that it cannot imply less then pardon of the whole guilt and punishment

who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect 
it is god that justifieth 
who shall condemn 
being justified by faith 
we have peace towards god 
how comes it then to pass 
that the saints of god be subject to so many afflictions 
for answer 
we must know 
that whereas there are two things in sinne 
the fault 
deformity or stain 
and the punishment 
christ who is the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world 
by the working of his grace purgeth out the one 
and by vertue of his satisfactory sufferings 
freeth such as he purgeth from the impurity of sinne 
from the punishment due unto it 
and in proportionable sort he purgeth out the one by his sanctifiing grace 
and by vertue of his satisfactory sufferings freeth us from the otherfeild of the ch

so that when sinne is only so purged out 
that it is no more predominant 
there remaineth no condemnation 
but yet some affliction 
and when it is wholly taken away 
there remaineth no punishment at all 
for it is most certain that christ suffered the punishments 
not only of
those sins 
that men commit in the time of ignorance 
infidelity 
and the state of nature 
but of all sins 
and the justice of god will not require one debt to be twice paid 
so that the reason why godless men are subject to all kinds of punishment 
is 
because they do not become one with christquamdiu inhabitat in nobis peccatum

nor are made partakers of his sanctifying spirit 
purging out the sinfulness that is in them 
that they might enjoy the benefit of his satisfaction 
and likewise the reason 
why good men turning to god by repentance 
are still subject to some punishments in this life 
notwithstanding their union with christ 
is because they are not so fully conjoyned to christ 
and made partakers of his spirit 
as to be purged from all sin 
for if they were 
they should be freed from all punishment by his sufferings 
he having suffered for all them that become one with him 
all that the justice of god requireth

that temporal evils did befall david after his sin was pardoned 
and the like doth befall other of gods children 
but it must be known 
that those afflictions were not satisfactory punishments 
or had any respect unto the justification of those that were therewith exercised 
but they only had respect unto their farther sanctification

he that would obtain pardon through the grace of god 
must begge it by earnest and hearty prayer 
the means to remove sin is to flie unto the mercy of god in jesus christ 
prayer is necessary not onely to the sense and manifestation of forgiveness 
but to the pardon it self 
necessary by the ordinance of grace 
not as a meritorious cause 
but as a means whereby it is obtained 
for pardon is received according as it is proffered and promised in the word of grace 
the glad tidings of salvation

and he was entreated of him 
and heard his supplication

god be merciful to me a sinner 
faith believeth according to the promise of grace 
and receiveth what is offered in the word 
according as it is offered 
but promise of forgiveness to be vouchsafed unto him that doth not ask it 
there is not one in the whole scripture 
moreover 
the lord
will not justifie the wicked 
that is 
the impenitent 
and such as go on in their wicked course 
but such as turn from their evil way 
and seek him unfainedly 
but faith and remission are linked immediately 
that is most true 
but we are to know there be divers acts of faith 
amongst which we may reckon these three as most pertinent to this purpose 
one whereby it obtaineth forgiveness 
another whereby it receiveth it 
the third whereby it assureth 
that sin is pardoned 
the first of these is prayer 
for faith desires mercy without humble supplication 
and looks up unto god as a poor petitioner 
as it assureth that pardon is to be had 
and stirreth the desire after it 
so it maketh the soul to go forth in hearty prayer 
that it might obtain 
hence we learn 
how we may come to assurance that our sins are blotted out of the lords remembrance 
first we must unfeignedly entreat mercy 
and then effectually receive it 
for the promise is 
aske and have 
seek and finde 
pray and thou shalt be forgiven 
and from this step we rise to the assurance of mercy 
concluding that as we have prayed 
so it shall be unto us 
a christian must not depend upon sense and feeling 
nor look for such a certificate from heaven as by inspiration or audible voice might comfort him in the certainty of gods mercy 
and expell all doubts and fears 
whether he will or no 
but he must stir up faith according to the word of promise 
and conclude the pardon of his sins 
as it is there laid down 
and because we have the word of the lord for it 
that whatsoever we ask according to his will in faith 
we shall obtain it 
therefore when we have prayed 
we must without more ado 
cast our souls upon the gracious promise 
and trust cnfidently in the mercy of the lord 
7 
in asking pardon of sin 
there must alwayes be hearty acknowledgement and confession of sin 
when david gave over hiding his iniquity 
and said 
i will confess my transgressions to the lord 
then saith he 
thou forgavest the iniquity of my sinps 
325 
1 jo

god hath promised to forgive those that confess their sin 
if we confess our sins 
he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins 
hearty confession of sin giveth glory to god 
for thereby is acknowledged his sovereignty and goodness 
the equity and holiness of his law 
his justice in punishingjos 
719 
his grace in pardoning our offences 
my son confess thy sin 
and give glory to god 
when a man hath committed a sinne 
and will not confess it 
he doth enforce god to bring him to tryal 
and discover his transgressions 
but he that freely confesseth 
putteth conscience out of office 
and is hereby capable of forgiveness 
god is ready to forgive 
but he will have it appear that forgiveness is of grace 
which is then manifest 
when we acknowledge our transgressions before him 
an unfeigned confession of sin 
argueth a true desire of pardon 
yea it doth put an edge to desire 
for when the bed role of many damnable sins is laid open to the view of a man 
it will make him earnest with god 
as it did danieldan 
919 
who after his confession 
is most fervent in prayer 
but he cannot entreat for mercy 
that will not confess his errors 
the whole need not the physicianjer 
313 
but they that are sick 
the promises of grace run thus 
acknowledge thine iniquity 
and be received unto mercy 
and if we would partake in the good promised 
we must perform the condition required 
look upon all the servants of god that have lived in former times 
we shall find 
when they sued for mercy 
they did evermore take shame to themselves in the hearty acknowledgement of their offences 
father i have sinned against heaven 
and before thee 
it is the property of faith to abase it self 
and magnifie the rich grace of god 
what then can be more fit and natural 
then for him that seeks justification by grace 
to condemne himself freely before the throne of grace 
and to set forth our unworthiness 
that god might be glorified in shewing mercy 
if thou canst not prevent sin altogether 
yet take heed that satan prevail not to draw thee to hide or deny 
or excuse it 
of all things that is most foolish and dangerous 
he that hides his sinne shall not prosper 
the root of this evil is pride and self-love 
the end shame and vexation 
sin upon the conscience is
like corruption in an ulcer 
that will throb and rage 
if it be not loosed forth 
the more we seek to cover our sins 
the more we discover them before god 
and to our own consciences 
and every excuse is an aggravation of them

believers may come to assurance that their sins are forgiven 
for whatsoever we ask in christ agreeable to his will 
we know that we are heard in it 
the papists object 
they who begge a pardon of sin 
are not sure of pardon 
but with more truth we may invert it 
they who may ask forgiveness may come to assurance that they have forgiveness 
nor is it consequent 
that if a man know himself to be justified 
that then he may not ask remission of his sins

9 
our humiliation 
invocation and faith touching forgiveness must be renewed daily 
as we must ask every day our daily bread 
so must we the pardon of our daily transgressions and sins 
for notwithstanding any former assurance of forgiveness 
if we take our eyes from christ 
the remembrance of sins past will disquiet conscience afresh 
but faith looketh to christ in all humility and hearty supplication 
again 
the best men are clothed with infirmities 
and in some thing or other do sin daily 
now as we transgress 
we must ask pardon 
constant repentance is no less necessary after we are entred into the state of grace 
then at our first entrance 
if no man can be justified or saved without repentance 
continual repentance is required to continuance in justification 
not that the former pardon can be made voide by new sins committed for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance 
but that continuance of gods gracious favor is to be sought in all humility 
as well as our first acceptance into the state of mercy 
and actual pardon of sins past 
for as a christian cannot utterly fall from grace 
and wholly loose the gifts of the spirit 
no more can he from the state of justification 
but as he that is fallen must rise by repentance for the repaire of grace 
so must he to obtain remission 
man regenerate is the subject capable of justification 
and so long as the life of grace abideth in a christian 
he continueth in the state of justification 
but actual remission of sins 
specially such as make breaches in the conscience 
is obtained by actual prayer of faith after the sin committedluk

if the regenerate acknowledge their sins 
god is faithful and just to forgive 
the seat of pardon is the heart of man contrite and humble 
which thirsteth after mercy 
i came to seek 
saith christ 
that which was lst 
and to bind up that which was broken 
the conditions without which pardon is not obtained 
are humiliation 
confession 
prayer 
forgiveness is free and of meer grace 
repentance and prayer are not causes 
for which 
but conditions without which 
this favour is not obtained 
not to disoute what god could have done without reprehension of injustice by his absolute power 
certain it is 
that the lord will not receive the impenitent into favour 
for what were this 
but to put no difference betwixt the righteous and the wicked 
to set open a gap to impiety 
to expose mercy to contempt 
thrusting it upon them that refuse 
and cast it away 
grace should not be glorious 
if it did hearten men to the practice of sin 
and encourage to persevere in an evil course moreover 
it is not enough that the pardon of mans sin be actually passed by god 
but this pardon must be sued out 
that the same also may be passed in a mans conscience 
and this must be renewed daily 
even as the conscience is blurred and stained with sins daily 
else a man shall have litle comfort or fruit of that pardon which stands upon record for him in heaven 
justification is a continued act 
and the application of it by the work of the holy ghost 
as also the full execution is wrought by degrees 
never perfected till the day of judgement
lastly 
if pardon of sin be asked that day in which it is committed 
the guilt lying upon the conscience 
it doth benumm the conscience 
and so it is forgotten altogether 
or else when it is put off till many sins be committed 
either the heart is discouraged with multitude of offences 
that it is afraid to present it self before god 
or if it do come into gods sight 
those many sins are confessed and prayed against but confusedly and in gross for the most part 
wherefore it shall be every mans greatest wisdom 
to ask pardon 
and make his peace with god every day 
it is not safe to suffer sin to lie long unconfessed and unpardoned 
lest it fester 
green wounds are soonest cured 
with most ease to the patient 
sins lying unpardoned beget other sins daily 
but speedy confession doth prevent the out-breach of after-sins 
aske pardon every day 
then will sins be more particularly confessed 
and more distinctly and earnestly prayed against 
and pardon will be sooner granted 
and that with less horror of conscience 
great is the security of that man 
who walking in the midst of dangers 
hath his accounts taken up in christ 
peace with god doth sweeten labor 
sleep 
sickness 
crosses of what kind soever 
he needs fear none evil 
that is freed from the danger of sin 
carrying an acquittance in his bosom 
all trouble and vexation ariseth from this 
that our faith is weak 
our assurance assaulted with many doubtings 
our communion with god many wayes eclipsed though our negligence in prayer 
all these things should move us effectually to renew our petitions for pardon 
and our faith in the promises 
for according to our desire so shall it be unto us 
david heard this promise from nathan in the name of the lord 
thou shalt not die 
yet ceased he not to ask mercy and comfort

sacrifices were appointed for sins willingly committed as well as for sins of ignorance 
the scripture mentioneth examples of many that sinning notoriously after grace 
have obtained forgiveness 
our saviour christ teacheth them that sin after baptism and regeneration 
to pray for remission 
and whatsoever we must ask 
we are assured it may be obtained 
the lord never taught us to begge what is impossible 
whereas committing of sins after knowledge 
and falling oft into the same sins 
doth much affright and burden the heart of many of gods dear children 
in so much that they are afraid to come so oft to god for pardon of the same sin 
yea sometimes they doubt whether they be in state of grace 
this doctrine doth serve to remove this doubt 
and these fears 
this salve which christ hath prescribed to cure such sores 
sheweth that it is incident to his own disciples to have need of it 
and sith he hath appointed a remedy for sins committed after conversion 
sc 
every day to ask forgiveness 
and more assurance of his favour 
let us daily use this remedy 
assuring our selves that this dayes sins confessed and prayed against 
shall be forgiven as well as any committed and forgiven heretofore 
as the body hath relapses into the same diseases 
and the same physick may be used to recure them 
so the soul hath relapses 
and the same remedy which before hath done good 
may and must be used again to recover them 
11 
whosoever would be justified before god 
must be beholding to god for the free forgiveness of all his sins 
as well as of any 
all sins are mortal 
and of themselves damnable 
wherefore if all sins be not pardoned 
a man abideth in danger of the curse 
faith cannot receive the promise of pardon for one sin 
and not for another 
nor doth god pardon one sin past 
when he remembers another 
to call to a reckoning for it 
when the faithful sin grievously to the wounding of their conscience 
till they have repented of that sin in particular 
they cannot believe the pardon of any past 
he cannot truely confess
and repent of one sin 
that repenteth not of every one 
nor can one sin be remitted without another 
christ saith to the thiefluc

for one sin is sufficient to exclude us out of the kingdom of heaven

forgiveness of sin 
and peace with god 
love to the church and commonwealth doth require it 
for while the sins of gods people remaine unpardoned 
they do decline 
and the whole state is exposed unto gods judgements 
this moved ezra to pray for the people 
fearing lest god should be angry with them 
till he had consumed them 
because they had married many strange wives 
and as we must pray 
so we must use all good means to bring our brethren from the error of their wayes 
for he that converts the wandring from his evil course 
doth save a soul 
and cover a multitude of sins 
whereas the sins of many fearful and tender hearted christians do oppress them 
that they 
as they think 
cannot pray for forgiveness they onely can grone and sigh out requests 
but cannot express them 
such as these may take comfort 
and raise up their spirits by thinking on this doctrine 
what though they cannot satisfie themselves in their own prayers 
they must not be so uncharitable as to think that others cannot pray 
yes they can pray 
and must and do pray for the forgiveness of your sins 
live upon their stock 
when ye have little of your own 
the papists talk of a treasury of the church wherein are reserved the overplus of the merits of the saints 
that when men lack merits of their own 
the pope may furnish them with supply from others 
this treasury is but a fiction 
but this doctrine commendeth unto us the true treasury of the church 
first 
christ jesus who commandeth all christians on earth to pray one for another 
he did pray for us 
next 
all faithful christians do according to the will of god 
pray for us 
which prayers of theirs are daily offered up by christ for us 
and cannot but avail with the lord 
because they be made by his appointment

the consequents of sin do argue it

or so wealthy 
as to owe no man any thing 
they are proud

insult over their neighbors 
when yet they make no bones of any sin 
that may make for their pleasure

great is the misery of that man whose sins are treasured up against the day of vengeance 
it is burdensome to live in debt and fear of arrest 
though a man may fly or hide himself from the bailiff 
or if he be taken can suffer no greater sorrow then to be cast into prison 
where death will put an end to care 
but the arrest of conscience 
which cannot be avoided 
is much more terrible

even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you 
to forgive wrongs is one part of that debt of duty which we owe to god 
but the paiment of one part of what we ow 
and that very imperfectly 
cannot merit remission of other offences committed against his majesty 
besides 
our love to our neighbor is so weak and defective 
that it needs pardon 
and cannot be the cause why we are forgiven 
neither do these words make comparison 
in this wise 
to forgive me no otherwise 
but as thou seest me ready to forgive another 
as if our forgiveness were a rule 
sampler 
or master picture 
after which god were to conform his forgiving of us 
for that is a rule which we imitate 
but god doth not imitate us 
but we god in remitting offences 
therefore we are not a rule to him 
but he to us 
god doth remit to us many more 
and much greater offences 
and much more freely 
then we are wont 
or possibly can forgive to our debtors 
we sin more against god then man can against us 
our sins are more hainous against him 
then any wrong that can be offered unto usmat 
1824 
28 this is signified by that parable 
where the lord forgave to his servant a thousand talents 
when he would not forgive to his fellow-servant an hundred pence 
nor did the lord therefore remit 
because the servant had first forgiven his debtor 
as provoked by his example 
but first the lord forgave 
afterwards the servant would not forgive

we must remember that we break our promise solemnely given in this petition 
if we we do not pardon our neighbour 
but our forgiving others 
is a sign we are such to whom forgiveness belongeth 
and a helpe strengthening our faith to believe that we are heard in that request 
this act of ours is no cause 
as was said 
but a condition on our part required 
and a sign testifying that mercy belongeth unto us 
and that we are indeed received into favour upon our request 
for when we find that a spark of grace maketh us ready to forgive 
how much more may we assure our selves 
that god will out of his endless mercies be ready to forgive us 
and as he who seeth a print of this or that image 
doth know that the seal hath been set there and applied 
so we feeling our selves ready to forgive 
do come to know this more surely 
that gods forgiveness hath been applied in us 
and as one that doth see that done which is greater 
will easily believe the lesser 
so we seeing our selves made by his grace 
though sinful ones 
ready to forgive 
may much more be perswaded that god so infinite in goodness hath pardon for us 
that we may fear him 
again 
as they who have the condition on which a thing is to be done 
may boldly expect performance of that which dependeth on it 
so we having forgiveness 
in which god hath promised us forgiveness 
may be bold to assure our selves that we are pardoned

first 
when he doth not conceive anger or desire of revenge for an injury

doth lay it down 
secondly 
when he passeth by the wrong 
and remitteth the damage being such as may be born without satisfaction 
thirdly

and call for punishment 
he doth it without spleen or malice 
in love and with compassion 
so that they do not forgive their debtors 
who either keep heatred in their hearts 
or mule about revenge 
or cast by what occasion to do hurt 
or be glad at any evil that doth befall their enemies 
yea 
they who think much to be reconciled to such as have wronged them

and to reconcile themselves unto them
q 
paul did not forgive alexander the copper-smith 
therefore remission is not necessary
a 
there is a three-fold remission 
of revenge 
judgment 
and punishment 
all men ought to remit revenge 
and of this the petition is to be understood 
judgment of others is not ever to be remitted 
for god forbidding a lie 
willeth not that we judg dissolute fellows to be honest men 
or the sluggard to be painfull 
but he would have us to discern the good from the evil 
and as it belongeth not to all men to inflict punishment 
so neither is it in their power to remit it 
for god willeth the execution of his justice and law 
the application is easie 
for paul was not carried against alexander with any private grudg 
but with burning zeal for the glory of god

7 not properly of civil debt 
of debt of duty 
not of debt of money 
yet so 
that if our debtors be not able to pay 
we are bound in duty to forgive them 
or at least to have a conscionable regard of their inabillity 
we must know therefore that in every wrong done unto us 
two things concurre 
first 
defect of love in him that wrongeth us 
or an injurious mind 
which is apt to beget the like defect in us 
scil 
to cause us to cease to love him 
yea 
to spite and seek revenge 
the second thing is 
there is some hurt or damage groweth either to our name 
life 
or goods 
which worketh in us that are wronged desire of satisfaction 
and recompense for the hurt done unto us 
the first of these 
sc 
their ill will to us 
must alwaies be forgiven 
so that all ill will in us to them 
and all purpose of revenge must absolutely and utterly be laid down by us 
but the scripture alloweth us to crave our debts 
and satisfaction for wrongs sustained 
yet because requiring of debts and satisfactions may proceed from malice and reveng 
difference must be put between one wrong and another 
some are small 
and they do us little damage 
and the consequence of them cannot be to any great harm 
some other wrongs are great 
which do much hurt our names 
goods 
or lives 
and the consequence of them is great 
again 
satisfactions must be distinguished
some are to be made to the magistrate 
others unto the party wronged 
now all those smaller wrongs 
which are no great blemish to our name 
or any great empairing of our goods or quiet 
must be remitted 
even in respect of satisfaction 
because love should cover all such offences 
and if we seek satisfactions in these cases 
it must needs proceed from want of love 
and from some degree of revenge 
except the magistrate and common wealth be interessed in the cause 
and do require us to prosecute such offenders 
for to make them examples to like offenders 
but then it must be done in love and mercy to their persons 
but if the damage be greater then love is bound to pass by 
because in our name 
life and goods 
we are much wronged 
or the consequent of not seeking satisfaction 
would be much to our damage 
or to the dishonour of god and religion 
as in some cases it falleth out where the matter of the wrong is not alwaies great 
in such cases the scripture alloweth us to seek satisfactions 
but with these and the like cautions 
first 
we must not seek to right our selves as judges in our own causes 
but must referre it to neighbourly arbitrement 
or if that cannot be 
then to referre it to the magistrate who is appointed in such cases to do right 
secondly 
satisfactions must not be required in spleen 
or prosecuted in malice 
or by indirect courses
q he is a base fellow that hath done me some notorious wrong

may they use this petition who from their heart desire to forgive their enemies 
but cannot obtain that perfect oblivion of injuries that is required
a 
they may 
for in the faithfull so long as they live in this world 
there abideth both flesh and spirit 
corruption and grace 
whose acts and motions are contrary 
the flesh is prone to revenge 
the spirit inclineth to pardon 
whence followeth a perpetual combate and contention 
the part regenerate resisting the desires and motions of the part unregenerate 
and the part unregenerate making head against the part regenerate 
again 
asking forgiveness of god 
we ask whatsoever is necessary to the obtaining of it 
as grace to forgive our enemies 
according to the commandement of christ
q 
is nothing required of us to the obtaining of mercy with god 
but that we forgive our enemies
a 
there was a sort of hereticks that thought they might live as they lis
and yet be sure of pardon 
so they did forgive their adversaries 
but the scripture teacheth plainly 
that if we would obtain mercy 
we must humble our selves 
repent of sinne and turn unfeignedly unto the lord 
and it is a certain truth 
that no man can in conscience forgive his enemy 
who doth purposely live in any known sinne 
amongst many conditions which might have been mentioned 
our saviour made choice of this 
because nothing is more fit 
then that he who begs mercy 
should shew mercy 
and it doth fitly serve to insinuate with god by argument taken from the greater 
we that have much of the old leaven 
by the spark of thy grace in us 
are ready to forgive 
be thou much more 
moreover 
it is a most grave common faction that we live together in brotherly kindness 
and seeing offences will come by reason of mens infirmity 
we should be the more circumspect 
that our hearts be not poysoned with rancor and malice
q 
what conclusions may be drawn from these words
a 
1 
in asking forgiveness of sinne 
it is meet that reasons be used to confirm and strengthen faith in respect of audience 
thus david yeeldeth reasons why god should have mercy on him 
first from his tender mercy 
then from his own confession of his sinnes 
and from the effects which would follow upon gods shewing mercy to himpsal 
511 
3 
7 
apt reasons serve much to embolden a sinner to come before god 
and this he hath need of 
because satan hath many devices to keep him from asking forgiveness 
as sometimes to hide from his sight the ugliness and danger of sinnes 
causing him to forget his sinne 
or to think there is no great need of pardon 
if this fetch will not prevail 
then he setteth all his sinnes before him 
and stretcheth them upon the tenters of aggravation 
making them seem greater then they are 
pleading gods wrath and justice against them 
now against arguments of discouragements and fears 
reasons of asking forgiveness are very usefull 
strong reasons are the props of faith 
the kindlers of desire 
what oyl is to the flame 
that are reasons to fervency 
the greater hope to speed 
the more heart to ask 
dulness doth often seize upon us when we are to seek mercy 
the best remedy of that disease is to furnish the heart with strong arguments to perswade 
that it shall be unto us according to our desire 
2 
all gods actions to us imprint their stamp in us 
his election makes us choose him 
and choose the houshould of faith before all others 
his love of us 
maketh us love him and our brethren 
his forgiving us 
maketh us forgive our brethren 
when christ is received by faith 
his stamp and image is engraven upon the soul 
he that hath obtained mercy of the lord 
is mercifull to others 
the word may be called the image of god 
as it unfoldeth his divine properties 
incomprehensible wisdom 
tender mercy 
rich grace 
patience 
long-suffering 
and readiness to forgive 
which being digested by faith 
doth transforme us into the nature of it 
that we become holy and pure as the word is pure and holy 
3 
conscionable forgiveness of our enemies is to the humble and penitent sinner 
an undoubted token of forgiveness from god 
for if we wretched sinners upon earth can forgive othersmat 
57 
&amp 
614 
15 
how much more will the gracious god of heaven forgive us 
if we having but a drop of mercy can forgive others 
much more will god 
who is a sea full of grace 
but this reason doth tie god to forgive us no otherwise then by his gracious and free promise 
for it is a necessary consequent and fruit of the other 
and not a cause 
considering the inequality between our debt unto god 
and mens debt unto us 
both in number and weight 
which ariseth from the great inequality between god and man 
for if to strike a king be much more hainous then to strike a poor subject 
what is it to strike god 
who is infinitely greater then all the kings of earth 
let us therefore nourish this grace 
and put away implacableness 
which once out 
will never return 
why should a man be so cruel to his own soul 
as not to forgive 
for besides 
the torment and vexation of mind that accompanies
desire of revenge 
he that will not forgive wrongs cannot enjoy the sense of pardon and forgiveness from god 
let us forgive so as never to remember any more that which is remitted 
to perswade to this christian duty 
let us reremember 
1 
that no man can wrong us so much as we daily trespass against god 
therefore if we forgive the greater 
we must forgive the less 
2 
no man can wrong us so much as our saviour was wronged for us 
yet he forgave his persecutors 
and hath left us his example 
that we should follow his steps 
3 
they that revenge themselves upon their neighbours 
wrong god more then their neighbour could wrong them 
for they usurpe upon his divine prerogatve

he that will not forgiverom 
1219 
hurts themself more then he that doth the wrong 
for the injury offered reacheth but to the name 
body or goods 
but the desire of revenge woundeth the conscience 
provoketh god to wrath 
shutteth the gate of his mercy agaist s 
and bringeth our sins into remembrance before him 
let unmercifull and revengfull spirits consider what is said in the parable of him that would not forgive his fellow servant 
he was delivered to the tormentorsmat 
1834 
5 
it is a great argument that we are the sons of god 
if from the heart we forgive injuries 
and love our enemies 
for in this that we love them that hate and persecute us 
some similitude with our heavenly father doth shine forth 
who hath redeemed us being enemies with the death of his sonne 
love your enemiesmat

forgetfulness of injuries doth embolden us to ask pardon of god with confidence and good assurance 
the best way to obtain mercy with god 
is to shew mercy to them that have offended against our estimation 
goods or body

is a testimonial sent from heaven to certifie the heart 
that god is at one with us in jesus christ

who doth not from the heart forgive his enemies 
for mercy must be asked as christ hath directed 
and as it is promised in the gospel 
but forgiveness is never promised to him that will not forgive 
god hath expresly commanded every christian to forgive one another 
and when they come before him 
to lift up pure hands without wrath and doubting 
what is more absurd 
then for a man to ask forgiveness of god 
when for gods sake he will not forgive 
what is this 
but to preferr his credit and reputation before gods favour 
what is more equal 
then to deny his request 
who will not do for another 
what he requesteth to be done unto him 
he that will not blot out the remembrance of an injury 
is too proud to speed in his suit when he intreateth mercy for himself 
the lord bendeth his ear to the cry of the humble sinner 
that abhorreth himself 
and repenteth in dust and ashes 
but an heart meditating revenge is lofty 
sick of self-love 
the acts of faith are uniform 
and it cannot lift up the soul to beg pardon 
nor receive the promise 
when it is not of force to allay the bitterness of passion 
when the malitious make this petition 
what do they but desire god to pour a curse upon them 
nor is their sin the less 
if they leave out this condition 
for what is that but a presumption 
breach of gods direction 
and prophane abuse of his love 
5 
he cannot but forgive others 
which is perswaded in his heart by faith 
that his own sinnes are forgiven him 
necessarily with forgiveness of sinnes is joyned true charity and love of our neighbour

forgiveness of sinnes and grievous temptation are inseparable companions 
for the sonnes of god having obtained pardon of their offences 
when they set themselves to walk before god 
and to perform all duties of piety and love 
as the word requireth 
the enemy of man-kind doth devise all arts 
and prepare his engines to cast them down 
that he might bring them again into slavery and bondage

ʋntill the time that his word came 
the word of the lord tried him 
and this kind of temptation by outward judgments is most grievous 
when the lord layeth his own hand so grievously upon his servants 
that they think themselves to be quite forsaken 
2 
by offering occasions and objects to try whether they will sinne or no 
a man suspecting his servant which in word promiseth fidelity 
layes a purse of money in his way 
to try if he will steal it 
which if he steal 
he hath found by watching 
that he is a secret thief 
and so laid him open for stealing any more 
now this trying of him is no sinne 
though he sinne in stealing 
in the same manner god tempteth his servants to try their stedfastness and constancydeut

thou shalt not hearken unto to the words of the prophet or dreamer of dreames

and withdrawing his graces from them 
we read of hezekiah 
that god left him to try him 
that he might know all that was in his heart2 chro

and thus god tempteth no man 
that is

there is a good temptation 
which is the tryal of the heart 
and an evil 
which is the wicked suggestion of satan 
the world 
or the flesh 
and solicitation to sin 
the good temptation is the work of god 
not the evil

and our own concupisence 
therefore satan is called the tempter 
that is 
the author of evil temptation 
2 
in the matter or objects 
for god tryeth us by commandements that are grievous to the flesh 
by abundance of outward blessings 
by outward afflictions 
by deferring to help 
by false prophets1 king 
2222 
by satan himself 
whom he suffers to buffet us 
but external good things 
or evil 
are only accedential occasions of evil tentations 
internal evils 
as concupisence 
is the proper cause of it 
3 
in the form 
good temptation is the tryal and discovery of some grace or corruption lying hid in man 
of strength or weakness 
piety or impiety 
faith or infidelity 
patience or impatience 
sincerity or hypocrisie 
constancy or levity 
which tryal is a thing good in its kind 
and in some sort to be desired 
but evil temptation is the inticement or allurement of the heart to evil thoughts 
counsels 
acts and works 
which is a thing it self evil 
and hurtfull 
4 
in effect 
for in good the lord doth ever obtain what he doth intend 
for alwaies by the tryal of probation 
either the faith and constancy 
or the infidelity and weakness of men is brought to light 
in the evil 
satan doth not ever effect what he intendeth 
but when we give way to the temptation 
and do not manfuly resist unto the end 
nor earnestly crave aid or defence of god 
5 
in the the end 
for god tempteth to a good end 
either that the glory of his grace might be more illustrious by our faith 
patience 
obedience 
constancy 
and that others by our example might be provoked to holiness 
or that the pride of our flesh might be humbled 
fierceness tamed 
security shaken off 
hypocrisie detected 
faith and repentance increased in us 
but satan 
the world 
and the flesh 
tempt to an evil end 
for they tempt the godly to turn them from the study of godliness 
or to make them slothfull 
or proud and insolent of that they have 
and so plunge them into destruction 
they tempt the wicked 
lest they should repent of their sinnes 
and turn unto god 
6 
in the manner 
for satan tempteth a man to sinne against the will of god 
god tempteth a man to do some thing against his reason or affections
q 
for what reasons is god pleased to try his servants
a 
to whom god vouchsafeth a greater measure of grace 
to them he appointed singular tryals 
and temptations above other men 
first 
because gods graces do better appear in temptations then out of them 
as gold is best tried in the fire 
and thereby proved most pure and perfect 
secondly 
temptations serve to abase the servant of god 
and to bring him down in his own conceit 
that he be not proud of those things that are in him 
or puffed up with conceit that there is more in him 
then indeed there is 
this we see in pauls example 
he was buffeted of satan 
lest he should be exalted with abundance of revelations 
a type hereof we find in worldly affairs 
the best ship that floateth on the sea 
when it carrieth in its most precious jewels 
is ballaced with gravell or sand 
to make it sinke into the water 
and so sail more surely 
lest floating too high 
it should be unstable 
even so dealeth the lord with his servants 
when he hath given them a good measure of his graces 
then doth he lay temptations upon them 
lest they should be puffed up in themselvesluk

satan by inward suggestions 
and outward objects 
the wicked of the world by bad examples

alluring or terrifying 
the flesh tempteth when we are inticed of our own concupiscence 
the things of this world 
though good of themselves 
do much hurt unto us by accident 
as wine 
though good of it self 
doth much hurt unto persons intemperate 
look as a sick man is much endangered

but feed his sickness 
so the presence of those things which disdiet the soul 
and provoke lusts 
are very dangerous 
the occasions of many temptations 
these are the enemies that do assault us 
but the most pernicious is the flesh 
for without it neither the world 
nor the devil can have any power over us 
in vain should one knock at the door where there is none within to look out and answer 
in vain should the devil by his perswasions knock at our hearts 
did there not dwell in them these lusts which will look out to him too readily 
satan prevailed indeed with our first parents 
but the reason was 
their willing and ready listening to his allurment 
which they might have withstood but would not 
again 
though the devil be a furtherer of all provocations to lust 
as unclean persons do help complexion with the painting box 
doth make them seem to us good in farre greater degree then they are 
yet they would not be able to tempt us effectually 
had we not this lust in us 
look as a man while he is now in a hot fit of his ague 
while this heat doth possess him 
o he thinketh drink the only thing 
and counteth them happy that may drink enough 
but when this distemper is over 
though the pot were by him 
careth not to taste it 
so these earthly things 
when concupiscence is up 
oh alass 
such false glasses these are 
that our judgment and estimation do think them so good that we may not forbear them 
when the same things at another time 
when lust is somewhat subdued 
do little or nothing stirre our desires 
that he would think his phantasie and senses were by some jugling delusion corrupted

descovering 
what the temptations are that we pray against in this petition 
what it is to lead into temptation 
and how god may be said to do it
question 
what are the temptations that we pray against
a 
whatsoever things 
by the corruption of nature 
are unto us occasions of sin 
be they in themselves not hurtful 
but more fully to answer this question sundry things are to be noted 
1 
things not good in themselves may be profitable by accident 
as crosses and afflictions which of themselves destroy nature 
through the mercy of god are means to purge sin 
now the good that commeth by the cross we pray not against 
but against the cross and affliction which of themselves are evil 
2 
god willeth some things simply 
others as they are exercises of faith and prayer 
tryals 
and testimonies of our constancy 
now what god willeth simply 
we are to will 
but we are not to will evils as evils 
onely it is required that we patiently bear evils as they are good 
that we ought not simply to will temptations 
appears hence 
because to bear them is an act of patiencetentatio non appetenda

which it should not be 
but rather of duty 
if we ought to will them simply 
and not to pray against them 
3 
we pray to be delivered from temptation 
not that we shall obtain perfect freedom in this life 
but because we are delivered from many 
in which we should perish 
if we did not ask deliverance 
and that those evils into which we fall might be profitable 
god will give these two very great blessings to them that ask deliverance in general 
but this benefit is imperfect for the relickes of sin that remain in us 
4 
the principal sleights that satan useth to vanquish the strong and valiant are these 
1 
when the affliction doth continue long 
and deliverance is differed 
2 
when it seems to be an enormous 
singular 
extraordinary 
unusual affliction 
3 
when under pretence of some great good he doth tempt to undertake something 
which is joyned with peril 
or above our strength and calling

the hebrew word that answers to that which is translated lead 
signifies to bring upon 
or cause to come upon 
and is rendred of the seventy 
by words equivalent unto this 
in the new testament it signifies to bring 
or to bring into 
and thus according to the use of the word 
to lead into temptation 
is to bring into the hand and power of temptation 
that we faint under it 
or be foiled by it 
thus the hebrews say 
to be brought into the hands of joy 
fear 
sickness 
sin 
sleep 
for to rejoyce

&ampc 
to tempt unto sin 
is to intice or incline the will of man unto wickedness 
to lead into temptation 
is to bring things so to pass 
that a man is exposed unto tempters 
whether they be evil men 
or satan 
or a mans own evil lusts 
who are the immediate actors in temptations unto sin 
in this act of leading into temptation 
allusion may be made unto the acts of a general of an army 
who may according to his discretion lead which band he pleaseth 
and set them in the forlorn hope 
the place of greatest danger 
and may reserve which band he pleaseth in the corps du guard
the greatest safety 
it may likewise be resembled by an act of the moderator of the games of combates 
where none might enter the lists and play their prize 
but according to the permission and appointment of the overseer and moderator of those exercises 
nor is it barely to be beaten with temptation 
or exposed to temptations 
but to be cast upon it in such sort that it doth get the upper hand over us 
and we be overcome of it 
either by consenting 
or giving place 
the sense of this phrase may be understood by comparison of other places 
of the incursion or immission of tentations the scripture saith1 cor

it had been a great malepartness to have delayed it 
that the strength of the words should perish by a waterish interpretation 
but now that the scripture useth this phrase in divers places

the chaldees and the sabees did 
that sitting in the throne of his high judgement 
he sendeth the divel to be a lying spirit in the mouth of the false prophets 
that he commandeth him to go and perswade the wicked 
god indeed suffereth men to be tempted 
but this is not an idle permission 
as some imagine 
but joyned with a work of god 
as in crucifying christ 
it is said 
they did nothing but that which the hand of god hath determined before 
for if god did onely permit sin and no way work in it 
he should not govern in the most actions of men 
seeing the greatest part of the world are wicked 
all whose actions are 
as themselves are 
wicked 
but let it here be observed 
that sin hath reference unto god as it is an object or subject wherein or whereupon he worketh 
disposing it to his own holy ends 
but it never hath reference unto god 
as the effect hath to the efficient cause 
to be wrought by him
q 
how is god said to lead into temptation
a 
god cannot possibly sin 
nor be the author of sin in and with his creature 
as he is of every good word and work 
for he doth neither inform the manner of it by his commandment 
nor work it in him by his spirit 
god cannot so far will sin 
as to approve it for good in it self 
he cannot be the author of it in the creature 
nor yet the creature work while it keepeth communion with him 
god inticeth no man to sin 
but without stain or blemish to his wisdom 
holiness and justice 
he leadeth whom he will into temptation

by his power and providence he upholdeth the tempters and tempted 
preserving their life and strength for action

2 
he doth sometimes propose some object 
whereby occasion of sin may be taken 
as bathshebas washing her self was ministred unto davids sight 
3 
he doth let loose satan 
and doth not hinder the tempter from tempting 
thus he gave satan leave to set upon our first parents
in paradise 
4 
he doth leave man unto himself in the temptation 
and not support him with that grace without which he seeth that man would not stand 
god furnished forth our first parents that they might stand if they would 
but he gave them not to will

they sell by accident of their own liberty and vertibility

which he hath just cause to do 
if he please 
for what man doth not by his sin deserve that punishment 
if a man abuse his hand 
why may not god wither it as he did jeroboams 
we hold this to be good 
justice 
and is it not as good justice 
that those that have abused their powers of imagination of understanding 
and of discerning things that differ 
should be punished by being deprived of the right use of them 
7 
god doth smite the sinner with blindness in understanding 
hardness of heart 
the spirit of slumber and giddiness 
which doth directly bring the sinner to commit sin 
for as death bodily is good in the nature of it 
though not good to a living person 
so is this blindness 
pravity 
hardness of heart 
good as expressors of divine displeasure 
though not good to man 
who should be conformable to the law 
and free from them 
good as inflicted 
not as contracted and received 
8 
god doth suspend all actions which in any degree tend to hinder sin 
and not onely presents things which may take occasion to pervert 
but also seemingly provoke by occasions of sinning 
thus by his judgements he provoked pharaoh 
whose heart was hardened 
and shimei upon the sight of david his poverty 
was moved to curse him 
the reason of all is 
it were just with god to consummate spiritual death upon the creature now sinful 
and therefore much more lawful to execute such a degree as is inferiour

god doth punish sin with sin 
because the gentiles did provoke god by idolatry 
he did punish them with giving them up to uncleanness 
these later sins were not punishments 
in regard they deserved further punishment and condemnation then the former 
yea a further desertion of god 
but in regard of committing these acts themselves 
lastly 
god leaveth some for a time onely 
and suffers them to fall into some particular offence 
out of which he raiseth them again by the power of grace 
others he leaveth utterly 
and giveth up to their own lustsrom

a 
first 
that god would of his mercy keep us from knowing temptation 
and to this end we pray 
1 
that seeing we cannot be tempted without the will of god 
nor resist without his power 
if it be his blessed will 
he would give us neither poverty nor riches 
nor any such things as may endanger our spiritual estate 
but mercifully preserve us from whatsoever might be occasion of sin 
2 
that he would tie up satan 
restrain his malice 
and bridle his power 
that he might not assail us in that kind 
or else make us wise to know 
and avoid his stratagems 
3 
that he would curbe the rage of wicked men 
and preserve us from the evil that is in the world 
4 
that he would kill sin 
abate the power of corruption that is within us 
and dry up the filthy streams of idle 
vain 
wicked motions 
and desires 
secondly 
we ask 
that in temptations 
if he see good to prove us 
he would alwayes stand by us with his grace to keep us from falling 
and vouchsafe to worke effectually by his holy spirit 
to stir up his graces in us and bring them into exercise to put good motions into our hearts 
and cause us to remember his word 
to strengthen us manfully in the encounter 
to give us an holy use of our tryals 
and to make us superiours 
even conquerors in all things wherein we are tempted 
that all things being finished we may stand strong 
and endure stedfast unto the end 
thirdly 
that god would not give us over to the lusts of the flesh 
or to the malice of the divel 
but that he would have merciful respect to our weakness 
and favourably keep us from the hour of dangerous and pernicious temptation fourthly 
that he woud stir us up to be sober and vigilant 
standing upon our watch 
prepared for the on-set 
having our loins girded with verity 
and our heart furnished with the spiritual armor of a christian 
be sober and watch 
for the divel goeth about like a roaring lyon 
seeking whom he may devour 
fifthly 
we pray that god would make us poor in spirit and strong in faith 
that we never trust in our selves 
nor distrust in god his power and aid 
through god we shall be able to tread down our enemies 
sixthly 
we crave faith 
hope 
fear of god 
patience and consolation 
that be our temptations never so many 
so long or so grevious 
we may hold out and stand fast 
and neither presume of our wit 
nor despaire of gods mercy 
but continue in prayer 
and wait for deliverance in the name of the lord 
seventhly 
that he would preserve and increase his graces in us 
whereby we might the better
quell the motions of the fleshheb

yea 
and if he leave us at any time to our own weakness

put an end to all tryals

perfect the work of his grace in us

i will keep thy commandments 
o forsake me not utterly 
2 
we entreat that we may not be given over to the power of satan 
the swing of our lusts 
the will of the ungodly 
that their wicked enterprises may not prevail 
whereby they seek to seduce and destroy us 
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies 
forsake me not 
o my lord 
o god 
be not far from me 
3 
that we be not ensnared with the occasions of sin that be in the world 
turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity 
4 
that we be not captivated or held in subjection of any sin 
let no iniquity have dominion over me 
oh 
let me not wander from thy commandment 
5 
that we be not left to our selves to trust in our own strength and wisdom 
as did peter 
nor given over to impatience and despair as saul 
6 
that we grow not secure and mindless of the craft 
malice and power of our enemies 
and the danger wherein we stand at all times by reason of the snares they set privily to catch us 
7 
that we forget not to run unto god by earnest and hearty prayer for his gracious aid 
at what time soever we find the enemy to set upon us &amp 
sollicite unto evil 
8 
that we may not be presumptuous to rush upon the occasions of sin 
such as evil corruptions 
needless entanglements in the world 
reading scurrilous books 
&ampc 
9 
that we run not into such sins as provoke god to lead us into temptation 
of which sort are these 
all refusing or slight receiving the love of the truth 
abusing or not making right use of that knowledge a man hath 
willingness to be ignorant of the truth 
&amp 
wilfulness to practice evil presumption of our own strength 
all willing casting ones self into the occasions of sin 
idleness &amp 
living without a calling 
allowance of secret sins &amp 
such like 
10 
we pray against all motions &amp 
enticements unto sin 
as the apostle paul did beseech god that the prick of the flesh 
&amp 
buffeting of satan might depart from
him 
not onely that he might overcome 
11 
that all stumbling blocks and occasions of our stay in the race of christianity might be taken out of the way 
or made no rocks of offence unto us 
12 
that we might not be an offence or scandal unto jew or gentile 
weak or strong christian 
brethren or them that be without 
lastly 
we pray that god in his displeasure would not punish sin with sin 
hardening the heart 
and giving us over to vile affections
q 
what are the wants to be bewailed
a 
1 
our spiritual servitude 
and continual rebellion of our wicked natures 
the remnants of the old bondage under satan most grievous and irkesome 
the evil motions that arise from it without ceasing 
as foggy mists from a muddy pond 
and our proneness to yeeld up our selves in every temptation to sin and satan 
the jews in bodily captivity 
wept when they remembred sion 
how much more should we weep 
when we feel the law of our members 
rebelling against the law of our mindes 
and leading us captive to sin 
2 
our sencelesness and presumption 
that forget the danger wherein we live by reason of our many and malicious enemies 
and notwithstanding the daily experience of their power and our frailty 
we neglect to look unto god 
as if we were able to stand without his aide 
we presume upon our strength 
feel not the want of his assistance 
pray seldom and coldly to be supported 
disregard the motions of gods spirit 
3 
though we pray not to be led into temptation 
yet we thrust our selves into it 
for we discover our passions and lusts 
manifest our weakness 
rush into the occasions of sin to satisfie desire 
suffer our thoughts to rove and wander up and down we know not whither 
confer with the suggestions of satan 
and give them harbour in the minde 
4 
when we feel satan thrust sore at us 
we are ready to faint 
as if the lord would not or could not help us 
and if the suggestions of the flesh be strong and importunate 
we grow weary of resistance 
and give place to sin 
5 though we be compassed with enemies on every side 
both within and without 
yet we lay down our watch 
cast off our christian armor 
and set upon the performance of many duties 
and converse in most companies 
as if we had none to set against us 
or contrive our hurt
q 
how must we stir up our selves devotionally to make this petition
a 
1 
we must often call to remembrance the dangers in which we live 
whiles the soul is in this mortal body 
whom the flesh 
the world 
and the divel do oppose on every side 
what anger 
what lust can do in us 
who is not compelled to feel it to his great sorrow and grief 
who doth not find these pricks 
is not provoked with these stings 
the stroaks and assaults are so many 
so divers 
that it is most hard not to receive some great wound 
but besides these enemies which dwell and live with us 
there are other most bitter adversaries 
which the apostle calleth spiritual wickedness 
principalities and powers 
whose hatred against us is infinite 
unappeaseable 
that we cannot expect any truce or peace from them 
if it could stand with christian courage 
resolution and honesty to desire it 
2 
another motive is to think 
to what the temptations of the divel tend 
this is the white he shooteth at 
that he might make us naked before god 
stripped of his favour 
which is better then life 
for the divel seeketh by them to make us dishonor god 
rob our hearts of his kingdom 
fetter us so with our sin 
that we may be dis-enabled from obeying him 
to take away all our peace and prosperity in things outward 
to fill us with fear and weariness in all the duties we go about 
and uncomfortable doubtings 
yea despairings touching the pardon of sin 
in a word 
to bereave us of all good which in the former petitions we desire 
and to bring upon us the contrary evils which are most horrible 
he playeth no small games when he beginneth his temptations 
3 
we must remember how tedious his former tempting and prevailing against us hath been 
for we 
like children 
who remember beating no longer then it smarteth 
we i say 
remember the bitterness of our daily falls the divel giveth us 
no longer
then god letteth the sting of them stick in us 
and this doth make us 
that we feelingly cannot pray against that whose anguish and evil we do not remember 
4 
we must consider 
how we are every where subject to temptations 
at home 
abroad 
in wife 
children 
servants 
in good company to security and unfruitfulness 
in bad 
to sin with them in speech 
gesture or consent 
yea in good deeds 
before we do them 
when we have done them 
to carelesseness 
pride 
security 
vain-glory 
at bed 
at board 
for as fools and children not knowing evils fear them not 
so we not knowing this evil 
are less fearful 
and flee not so fearingly 
praying to have it prevented 
every where snares of temptation are laid for us 
who 
that should go such a way 
in which he could not take a step without danger 
would not go wearily 
and often lift up his heart for protection 
5 
we must think how diligent and watchful the divel is 
he that knoweth what baits we bite at 
and will cast them out every where 
he knoweth where we are weakest 
and will never want occasions to provoke us 
again 
we must think how mighty he is 
what cannot he do with us 
if god keep us not 
he would carry us to any evil 
as a whirlewind doth the drie stubble 
6 
we must often repeat our own infirmities 
how we be so far from being able to withstand him 
that all we have of our own 
is readier to follow then he to whistle us after him 
7 
we must remember such examples of worthies as have been grievously foiled 
as david 
peter 
&ampc 
yea presidents we have of some hanging themselves 
some tempted to it 
for such examples are like the thunder 
though it striketh a few 
it feareth all 
and are not we subject to have our minds distracted 
assaulted with any even the most grievous things that ever we heard to have befallen others 
lastly 
we must consider what a joy it is when we go a day more freed 
what an ease is it to the soul 
or if we be in a little forwardness to sin1 sam 
2532 
33 
yet if we be rescued seasonably 
how it doth it rejoyce us 
what peace doth it bring to us 
now could we work upon our hearts 
the feeling of this benefit when we have it 
the sweetness of it would enforce us to beg it heartily 
whereas not heeding the worth of it 
we ask it unaffectionately
q 
vvhat are the mercies for which we must be thankeful

discovering the several inference 
or conclusions that may be drawn from this petition
question 
what conclusions may be drawn from hence
a 
1 
in this life the godly are subject to manifold and great temptations 
spots in a garment seem to spread 
when they are washed 
the chanell will stink when it is cleansed 
corruption will stirre when we endeavour to cast it forth 
the scriptures and christian experience witness 
that satan ceaseth not to pursue the faithfull with temptations of every kind 
that he might destroy them 
no sooner do we give our selves to jesus christ 
but the devil by force or fraud doth labour to pervert us 
the ungodly feel none assaults 
because they are wholly in his power 
and runne willingly whithersoever he doth allure 
but with the godly 
who fight under the banner of christ 
and bear arms against the kingdom of darkness 
it is farre otherwise 
he leaveth no plot unattempted to destroy them 
the devil goeth about like a roaring lyon1 pet 
58 
seeking whom he may devoure 
satan hath desired to winnow thee as wheat 
but i have prayed for thee that thy fail not 
moreover 
the world is an enemy to all them that christ hath called out of the world to the participation of life through him 
the world favoureth her own 
but hateth them whom god hath chosen as a peculiar people unto himself 
and all this cometh to pass by the wise providence of god 
that the regenerate might try their watchfulness over themselves 
be kept from being exalted above measure 
and that the power of god in preserving them from sinne 
and delivering them out of it 
may be seen in their weakness
2 
god doth lead us into all our temptations 
it is saidmat 
41 
christ was carried of the spirit to be tempted 
it is god only 
who when he seeth it meet 
doth bring his champions forth 
and letteth the powers of darkness encounter them 
neither can the devil stirre 
neither we bid battell of our selves 
can the lyons stirre till the keeper bring them out 
can a dog run till he that hath him in a lease loose him 
so it is 
god he hath them chained up in his almighty power 
yea thrown down to the prison of hell 
farther then he doth loose them 
and bring them into the earth 
where this shew is represented 
and battell to be seen 
they are not able to do any thing 
again 
we cannot on the other side 
being set upon 
buckle with the adversary power till god doth lead us to it 
the kings champion is not to play at his own pleasure 
no more are we farther then god designeth it 
but how can god lead us into those temptations which he seeth will certainly bring us into sinne 
answer 
because sin it self is not absolutely evil 
but only in respect of man sinning

as it was of him 
that rehoboam hearkened not to the people 
but cause in that place 
doth not signifie the proper effecting of a thing causally 
but a disposing of the proper causes so as they did produce this effect 
and from this doctrine we are admonished not to cast our selves into temptations 
he that loveth danger shall perish 
we must not make our selves poor as those hereticks that renounce all their substance 
that in voluntary poverty they may commend themselves to god 
no man should choose his dwelling among those of a sinfull profession 
as a chast man among stews

christ offered himself into temptation 
but herein we must not follow his example 
for he was carried extraordinarily by the power of his god-head into the desart to be tempted for our sakes 
that in his victory we might overcome 
again 
this must teach us contentment in all our temptations 
not that we must prevent repentance by this consideration 
but we must when we are truly humbled by this meanes 
keep our selves from being swallowed up of sorrow 
for gods will 
and gods turning all to good 
the devil will whisper them so as to make us pass by all exercise of a broken spirit in those things wherein we have offended 
moreover 
from this consideration we must walk in fear before our god 
who as a shepherd setteth his dog on a stray sheep 
so can he set the devil on us to hound us home if we stray from him 
lastly 
we see from this to our comfort 
that the devil cannot come against us at his pleasure 
for we are in the hands of our heavenly father 
who hath an over-ruling hand in the temptations and the sins of all men 
satan therefore cannot winnow us 
nor buffet 
no he cannot touch us 
but as he hath leave of our heavenly father 
the lord of hosts 
this we understand further by the case of job 
peter 
and paul 
satan could not assail them untill god did permit him 
and when he had leave to do his worst 
the grace of god was sufficient to preserve them 
that either they did not fall 
or it did recover them out of their fals 
and in the end caused them to die conquer ours over satan 
over their own lusts 
and over whatsoever opposed it self to the obedience of christ in them 
moreover 
if gods children do sinne 
he can order and dispose of their sinne to their good and to his own glory 
for many of gods children have gained more benefit by falling into some sinne 
which through gods mercy hath humbled them 
than they have by doing some good duties 
whereby they have grown exceeding high-minded 
have we not cause therefore to rejoyce that we are under the safe conduct of such a leader 
but let no man abuse this comfort 
and pervert it to his harm 
by taking liberty to sinne 
because god can work his own glory 
and good to man out of it 
what though the skilfull physician can make triacle of poyson 
and can tell how to apply poyson to his patient for his recovery 
yet if the patient hereupon be too busie with these poysons 
they will prove his death 
let us be glad our god can draw good out of evll 
but let us not be doers of that which is evil

gods sufferance is not to be understood without his action 
he is a voluntary agent in these things which he suffereth 
we must not think his permission is a pure permission 
either without his will 
or working in the thing permitted 
as often mans is 
for man may be said partly to suffer this 
not to do it 
because other causes have their activity without him 
and dependancy on him 
but it is otherwise with god
4 
all our strength against temptation is in god only 
he only dissolveth the works of the devil 
trampleth satan under feet 
keepeth him that he cannot so much as be disturbant to us 
when it pleaseth him 
we are down with the least blast 
were we in state of innocency 
we would not stand a moment 
let us therefore trust perfectly on his grace 
put on the shield of faith only 
our fore-fathers acknowledged that god 
not their strength 
gave them all salvation
against corporal enemies 
how much more must we confess it against spiritual 
who knoweth the power of satan 
or the infirmity of their own flesh 
that will not confess this most intirely 
but what serveth the armour for 
answer 
onely to this end 
that we may be able to get and hold god with us 
fighting for us
5 
it is the duty of all christians to pray 
that they be not led into temptations 
that they be not inticed or drawn into evil 
for of our selves we are unsufficient to think a good thought 
much more to resist the powers of hell when they assault

after conversion we are frail 
and disposed of our selves to return to our former evil conversation 
if the lord do not support and excite us with his grace 
the way of man is not in himself 
it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps 
if a man cannot order himself in the smaller things which concern the outward man 
much less can he dispose himself in the greatest which concern the inward 
in the matters of sanctification 
god is the only giver of grace 
and upholder in temptations 
this gift is so divine and so excellent 
that god hath in his wisdom reserved it to himself 
as a part of his divine prerogative 
to bestow it with his own hands 
for he knew well that if man could conferre grace 
or could attain it by any means with him 
all the praise thereof would be given to man 
and god should have none 
and man would grow so proud 
that he would claim heaven by merit 
and flesh would glory in his presence

and whatsoever particular circumstance shall fall out

whosoever would be preserved from sinne 
he must resist temptations 
the devil did deceive eve through his temptations 
and adam was likewise drawn into the transgression by the inticement of eve 
temptations and motions to sinne are the very seed and kernels of sinne 
which if they may be entertained 
so as to receive any warmth in a mans heart 
there is presently a conception of sinne 
which will cause him to be in labour and travell of itjam 
114 
15 
untill he have brought it forth into act 
there are no creatures so apt to bear
issue 
nor ground so rank to bearweeds 
no tinder or gunpowder so ready to take fire 
as the heart of man is to conceive sin 
and be inflamed with lust by evil motions and temptations 
wherefore all that would avoid sinne 
have cause to resist it in the temptation 
to resist beginnings of the evil of sinne 
is a rule as needfull to be observed against diseases of the soul 
as to withstand evils of pain in the beginning 
is needfull in diseases of the body 
now that we may withstand temptations 
first 
we must look to our own heart 
for that is the hold and fort of the soul 
if that be not true to us 
we are sure to be foyled in every temptation 
wherefore we must have it in an holy suspicion 
so far as to cause us to examine and search it daily to find out those trecherous and deceiveable lusts that lurke there 
and when by the light of the word we have found any 
let us not stay till they assault us 
but let us assault them by the power of christ 
and use martiall law presently to condemn and crucifie them 
and let us never leave purging the heart 
untill we can say 
it is not set upon any earthly thing1 tim 
69 
either to love it 
or fear it 
or if it be 
as he that will be rich 
so he that will have pleasure 
and will have glory of men 
shall fall into temptation 
nothing will bring the heart to a firm resolution to will in all things to live honestly 
so soon as this course 
secondly 
the understanding 
which is the watch-man and intelligencer of the soul 
must be well informed 
for no resolution can avail 
if judgment be wanting to discern betwixt good and evil 
it must be able to discern between good and evil 
between things not sinfull and sinfull 
and of good things to discern which are good but in part 
which every way good 
and what things are good only to sense and appearance 
and what is good in truth 
and so on the contrary 
that the baits to draw unto sinne 
taken from the gain 
pleasure 
and glory of this world may not move us 
because they be but uncertain 
van and transitory 
thirdly 
we must alwaies set the true danger of sinning 
and the true good and glory of well doing before our eyesheb 
1125 
26 and it will cause the heart to choose the good and refuse the evil 
if we can but judg aright of the joy that is set before us in the course of holinessheb 
122 
it will make us with our saviour christ endure the cross 
and despise the shame which in this world doth accompany christianity 
and we shall with speed runne the race that is set before us 
notwithstanding the impediments that we shall meet withall 
4 
there must be a continual watch set 
and faithfully kept 
wherefore the eye of the mind must be alwaies awake 
to see and observe what particular temptations do arise against us1 pet

either from within or without 
be sober 
be vigilant 
watch and pray 
fifthly 
when by watchfulness the temptation is discovered 
then we must buckle all the christian armour about us 
sixthly 
being thus armed 
we must animate and fill the heart with courage and resolution to resist even unto the death 
for which cause 
we must make an oration unto it 
such as wise and valiant leaders will make to encourage their souldiers 
we must mind our hearts of the odiousness and hurtfulness of that thing to which we are tempted 
how that it is a lust of the flesh and of the devil 
how it is enmity to our god 
and a deadly enemy unto us 
how that we must kill it 
or it will kill us 
let us mind our hearts with this 
that it will be to the dishonour of our king and countrey to be overcome 
that to yeeld to any temptation is contrary to our vow of allegiance 
which we entred into when we first professed to fight under christs banner 
let us tell our selves of the equity of our cause 
how that our warre is just 
think also of the wisdom and valour of our captain christ 
assuring our selves 
that how hard soever our conflict may be 
yet if we do not yeeld 
in the end we shall overcome 
and be more then conquerours
7 
we must stand fast in the faith 
quit our selves like men 
and be strong 
in the conflict two evils must be avoided 
first 
we must not trust to our own wisdom 
for then sinne will be too crafty for us 
secondly 
we must not resist
in the power of our own might 
for then the principalities and powers will be too strong for us 
we must therefore resist by the wisdom of the word 
and power of god 
so shall we put satan to flightiam

that we fall not into it 
and to free 
deliver and pluck out of the evil 
in which now we stick 
the seventy interpreters render those hebrew words which signifie to deliver 
free 
and pluk from the hand of the enemies 
in the new testament the apostle doth comprehend both significations in one place 
even jesus 
saith he 
who delivered us from the wrath to come 
that is 
who hath freed1 thes 
110 
rom 
59 
and doth preserve or keep us from the wrath to come and so in this place it implyeth these two things 
first 
preservation from falling into sin 
secondly 
help of god to rise out of sin by repentance 
keeping from evil in christs prayerioh 
1715 
and delivering from evil in this prayer 
have one and the same meaning 
when paul saith 
who shall deliver 
he meanethrom 
724 
who shall give me power against this body of sinne 
and that gods giving of repentance is deliverance from evil 
that of the apostle maketh it manifest 
where gods giving men repentance2 tim

is all one with recovering themselves out of the snare of the devil
q 
what is meant by evil
a 
the devil 
because he is of himself so exceeding evil 
and doth make it his work to infect all men with evil 
is called the evil or the evil onemat

so he that is called the evil one in the greek is by the same evangelist in that chapter 
and by others in the same parable 
called the devil 
and thus some divines 
antient and modern 
popish and protestant would restrain this word evil 
that it should mean the devil 
as if he only were prayed against in this petition 
and that because this word evil in the greek hath his article joyned with it 
which giveth an emphasis to evil 
pointing at some special evil one 
which is the devil 
to which may be added 
that in the new testament the word is seldom or never put in the neuter gender absolutely 
for adversity or what is hurtfull to us 
but some other word is annexed unto it 
as evil thoughts 
an evil heart 
evil times 
evil men 
evil workseph 
516 
but though the articles do give a special force sometimes unto the words to which they are annexed 
yet for the most part 
the greeks use to adde them rather for a grace and ornament of speech 
and are so used seven or eight times at least in the lords prayergen 
399 
1 sam 
188 
and the greek interpreters use the word to signifie whatsoever is hurtfull or evil 
as sinne 
danger 
loss 
damage
adversity 
and such like 
in the new testament it is used for wickedness 
in this very sense are the words of christ to be understoodjoh

by evil in 
this petition is meant that which maketh us worse 
not in regard of our feeling only

q what desire you of god in this clause of the petition

1 
whereas satan goeth about seeking whom he may devoure 
we pray that the lord would mercifully defend

keep and protect us from and against his snares 
tentations 
traps 
and tyranny 
or if he hath caught and intangled us in his snares2 pet 
29 
that he would deliver and free us from them 
2 
we pray that god would keep us from all sinne and every evil work 
that we fall not into offences 
or if we be fallen into any sinne 
or lie under the power of any corruption 
that he would powerfully snatch us out of it 
and inable us to walk in new obedience before himjer

he cannot set about them with any nimbleness of spirit while he lyeth in any sinne 
sinne lodging quietly in the heart 
taketh root 
and infecteth further and further 
it will increase it self 
and beget other sinnes 
and while a man lyeth in sinne 
he may look every hour when god shall inflict some fearfull judgment or other 
and then the remembrance of a sinne unrepented of proveth more heavy 
and more stinging then the judgment it self 
whereas 
though a man have sinned 
yet if god have given him repentance 
and have recovered him out of the sin 
he may come before god with boldness and can perform exercises of religion with cheerfulness 
and shall either prevent crosses or remove them 
or they shall do much good to his soul 
while they lie upon him 
3 
we pray to be delivered from the evils of this life 
dangers 
losses 
discommodities 
so farre as the lord knoweth them to be hurtfull for us 
4 
in this life our deliverance is imperfect 
and we lie open to new incursions of satan 
sinne and adversity 
therefore we desire to be translated out of this world

where we shall feel no motion of sinne

we desire that our heavenly father would keep us from an evil death 
that we die not the death of the uncircumcised 
that we be not taken unprovided in our sinnes without repentance 
but that god would grant us a comfortable and happy end 
for the death of the godly is the beginning of eternal blessedness 
but the death of the wicked is the beginning of torments endless and remediless
q 
what conclusions may be drawn from hence
a 
1 
satan and sinne are the greatest evils 
satan is that evil one that imagineth evil 
nothing but evil 
all manner of evil 
and that continually without ceasing 
sinne is a shamefull evil 
giving denomination unto all things that are truly evil 
causing them to be called evil 
the world is therefore called evil 
because it is a sinfull world 
men are called evil men 
because they be sinfull men2 tim 
313 
mat 
13 
and because the devil exceedeth all other in sin 
he is called the the evil one 
goodness is conformable to god the author and fountain of all good 
but sinne is repugnant to the will of god 
and so the greatest evil 
nor is it only evil in it self 
but the cause of all evils that any creature is subject unto 
for sinne brought man under the curse 
and will hold him under it 
except the mercy of god 
through the death of christ 
do deliver him
2 
he that watcheth continually 
striveth to grow in grace 
nourisheth the motions of gods spirit 
fighteth with good courage 
and denying his own strength flyeth unto the lord for help 
shall be mightily supported against evil 
he that doth these things shall never fall 
the godly2 pet 
110 
as may be observed in them that were foiled grievously 
did fall 
when they neglected their watch 
not when they were most strongly assailed 
the reasons ordinarily why the godly are grosly overtaken 
are 
either they make not resistance at the first 
but are prevented by the temptation before they be prepared to withstand it 
or being weary of resistance 
they cast away their weapons
3 
in all evils and calamities god is the chief refuge of a christian 
the saints acknowledg him to be the only authour of all good 
and their sole deliverer 
the power that is in any means to help or heal 
they know to be of him 
and that they profit as it pleaseth him 
but not otherwise 
god delivereth out of evil many waies 
first 
when he stoppeth calamities hanging over our heads 
that they shall not fall upon us 
as jacob was delivered from his enemies 
whom the slaughter of the sichemits had stirred up against himgen 
3 
secondly 
when being brought into great danger 
he doth preserve them safe and sound 
as daniel in the lyons den 
and his three companions in the fiery furnace 
thirdly 
the comfort that god gives to his servants when they are oppressed with evils 
is to them instead of deliverancepsal 
9419 
in the multitude of my thoughts within me 
thy comforts delight my soul 
fourthly 
when he turns the temptation to our good 
and makes what is evil in it self to become beneficial 
we must therefore learn to yeeld obedience 
and bid our god smell a sacrifice for the bitterest things we taste 
so farre as they are his disposition 
taking shame to our selves in them 
as they are the fruits of folly
4 
no temptation shall be able totally or finally to separate the saints from god 
fot that we are taught to pray agreeable with his will 
we are heard in that 
now this were the greatest evil 
not only in regard of our seeming 
or appearance to us 
but of the matter it self
5 
the faithfull must live in hope and assured confidence to be delivered from all evils 
though not in this life 
wherein they have received but the first fruits of the spirit 
yet in the life to come 
when they shall be replenished with fulness of the spirit 
for that cause our most bountfll father hath commanded us to beg deliverance 
that in him we might have hope to obtain what we ask

and the lord heareth thempsal

power and glory are communicated unto some creatures

as his due 
but also with respect unto our prayers 
and suits 
believing and professing that he 
as king of heaven and earth 
hath authority to dispose of all his treasures 
as omnipotent is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think 
finally 
as the god of glory is interessed in the welfare of his servants 
for the maintaining of the honour of his name 
and truth of his promises 
the reasons 
why we come petitioning to our heavenly father 
contained in these words 
are three
the first taken from the sovereignty of god 
who is the right owner 
the supream and absolute ruler over all things in heaven and earth 
therefore all blessings are to be craved at his hands 
for of right it belongs to him to bestow them upon us 
or it may be drawn from the special
sovereignty of god over his people

it is the office of kings to hear 
defend and protect their subjects against all their enemies 
now therefore 
o god 
sith thou art our king 
most rich in goodness 
more powerfull than all our enemies 
we pray thee be present with us 
for we are thy subjects 
and under thy defence we shall be safe 
the blessings we ask are the benefits of thy kingdom 
which we have not of our selves 
nor by any means of our own can obtain 
therefore according to thy commandement 
who hast charced us to ask 
and thy promise to hear the prayers of thy poor people 
we direct our supplications unto thee 
for whither should subjects fly but to their king 
thou hast instituted thy kingdom 
because thou wilt distribute blessings temporal and spiritual in it 
thou hast commanded them to be asked in thy kingdom 
and promised to hear the request of thy subjects 
thus faith sheweth in these words 
that she is certain of the good will of god towards us 
and doth profess that she doth rely upon the sole grace of god in jesus christ 
not upon any dignity or merit in our selves
the second is taken from the power of god 
who is able to do whatsoever he will 
and will do whatsoever shall make for the glory of his name 
and the good of his people 
who hath in his hand and power the things we askisa

q 
what conclusions may be gathered from these words
a 
1 
none is to be invocated or called on 
but he who hath the kingdom 
power and glory 
for as one lacking this or that in a house which is the masters 
cometh in by the back door 
if he pray a servant to give it whose it is not 
who hath no power so to do 
&ampc 
so if we seek our necessaries temporal and eternal 
at angels or saints 
which are servants to god 
who have no power to do any thing farther then beckned unto by god 
we take a wrong way to the wood 
but the papists think all is made whole while they do call upon saints or angels 
not as the principal authors of the things they ask 
but as secondary patrones 
who under god work these things for us 
to which is answered 
that not only to do religious adoration in any kind to them 
as the principal and chief power 
is sinne 
but also to call on them 
or trust in them 
as being some secondary divine powers 
although inferiour to god 
the angel-worship among the colossians 
did not differ thus much 
as if they had been the chief divine powers 
and yet is condemned 
nebuchadnezar did not enact that he should be worshiped as the highest god 
yet because he would have honour in some degree divine 
daniel did decline it as flat idolatry 
again 
this distinction with which they would salve their fact 
may be turned upon them 
as making against themselves 
for therefore these may not be called upon 
neither
may be trusted to religiously 
because they are secondary workers of things under god who is the principal agent
2 
we see what may confirm us in the assured hope to receive our requests 
namely 
to think that god hath the kingdom over us 
that he is powerful and glorious 
there is a respect between kings and their people 
which bindeth them mutually one to another 
hence it is that we promise our selves protection 
maintenance in our life 
the benefit of subjects from them 
because we are their subjects 
and they have the kingdom over us 
that god who by reason of this obligeth sinful men to seek the weal of all their people 
because they have received a kingdom over them 
himself will not fail on the same ground 
to procure all good to us 
who live under the regiment of his grace 
yet because it it not enough that god should have the regal authority over us 
unless he had the power also of working all things for our weal 
therefore this is joynedpsal

thine is the power what were subjects the better to be under a gracious prince 
but weak 
having as short hands to do them good 
as a large heart to wish it them 
so should it fare betwixt god and us 
if he were not almighty 
able to subdue all things to himself 
our faith were shaken 
for we cannot expect the treading of satan under our feet 
the quickening of us in our souls to every good work 
the justifying 
the protecting of us 
we cannot expect these things from one who hath not all power 
thirdly 
had god the right to help us 
had he the power also 
yet were it a thing that made not for his glory 
respected not the advancement of his honour

it being gods honour to perform all good things for his chosen 
honor is with men the spur of actions 
have men right and power to effect this or that 
notwithstanding if it conduce not to their honor and glory 
they will not move a finger to it 
but now there is nothing that wanteth to our assurance 
while we know that we are such to whom god hath right 
such for whom he hath all power 
such whom to protect and bless with all things spiritual and corporal 
is his great glory 
the case standing thus 
how can we doubt of receiving the things we ask at his hand in the name of his christ

and christ himself 
for reasons in prayer do much confirm faith 
and stir up fervency and good affection 
when a man can assure himself that he hath good warrant to ask 
and hope to obtain 
he will break through all the discouragements which the divel or a mans own heart can cast in to hinder him 
good reason to the affections 
is as oyle to the fire 
that causeth it to burn vehemently 
and though god need no reasons either to inform him of their need 
or to move him to supply their need 
yet he doth delight that his children should yeeld reasons of their requests 
because therein they shew proof of their faith 
knowledge 
confidence 
and other graces 
which is much pleasing to their father

we learn in prayer to abase our selves before god 
and utterly to deny all that is in us 
kingdom power and glory is all his 
not ours

shall no more be heard

amen is sometimes a title of christ 
because of his faithfulness and truth in performing all promises
2 
in the beginning of sentences it is an asseveration or corroboration of speech 
and confirmation of that we are about to say 
and that very vehement if it be doubled 
some take it for an oath 
but it is onely a confirmation of what we speakio

this is manifest by sundry places of the evangelists compared together 
for where one hath amen 
another hath surely 
truely 
or verily 
and in one and the same place these words are used one after another as signifying the same thing 
sometimes we shall finde amen and yea used promiscuously 
as words of the same signification 
the arabicke interpreters never retain the word amen 
so oft used by our saviour 
and kept by other interpreters 
but render it by a word that signifies surely

it implyeth both a desire of the thing so to be 
and confidence that so it shall be 
that amen is a wish or desire of what was spoken before 
it appeareth out of many places of scripture 
as by the answer of benaiah to david 
when he had appointed solomon to be ruler over israel and over judah 
saying amen 
which he doth explain by these words 
the lord god of the lord my king say so too 
the seventy interpreters do render this word 
sometimes let it be 
or god grant 
sometimes they translate it 
truely 
and sometimes they keep the hebrew particle amen 
that amen sheweth a perswasion of faith touching the thing before spoken of 
is evident by that of paul 
where having said of christ 
that he was over all 
god blessed for ever 
he addeth amen 
that is 
he was assuredly perswaded that it was so 
1 
so that amen in this place 
doth presuppose the understanding
of what was asked 
for every man must say amen to his own prayers 
as well as to the petitions that others do make for him 
but a man cannot say amen to his prayers 
if he know not what is said

christ teaching us to end our prayers with amen

we see what an excellent work prayer is 
in which two most excellent graces of a christian man be shewed forth 
hungring after mercy 
and faith whereby we believe the obtaining of it 
and when in praying men speak to god 
the majesty of god is after a manner that cannot be expressed 
nearer to him that prayeth then to others 
whom he doth adorn with singular gifts 
that they who pray holily unto god 
may be compared unto them who do come unto the fire 
who are made hot if they freez 
and are made to boyle 
if they be warm 
for their minde is inflamed to the glory of god 
their soul is enlightened in an admirable manner 
and they are enriched with divine gifts 
the more earnestly that men pray 
the more comfortably do they feel how sweet the lord is 
and how blessed are all they that hope in him 
and being compassed about with that clear light 
they commit themselves to the bounty of god 
nothing doubting 
but that embracing them with his fatherly and admirable charity 
he will abundantly supply unto them all things necessary to life and salvation 
by hope and confidence it hath come to pass 
that the saints of god beginning to pray in anguish and trouble have ended in joy and comfort 
it is admirable how the prayers of david have excelled in this kind 
he beginneth often with complaint

q 
what is the principal use of the lords prayer
a 
the principal use of the lords prayer 
is to direct gods church in making their prayers in all places 
at all times 
and upon all occasions though their prayers should be innumerable 
in the using of it there be three things required
the first is the knowledge of the lords prayer 
and all the parts thereof 
he that would pray by it 
must understand the meaning of it 
the wants therein to be bewailed 
and the graces to be desired
2 
there is in the second place required thus much skill 
that he be able to refer every want and grace to one of the petitions 
for example 
feeling in himself pride of heart 
he must be able to say this is a want in the
first petition 
and feeling a rebellion and slowness in doing gods commandments 
he must be able to say 
this is a sin to be prayed against in the third petition 
thus every want he must refer to his proper head 
again 
he must refer every grace to be desired to one of the petitions 
as strength in temptation to the sixth 
affiance in gods providence to the fourth 
patience in adversity to the third 
sence of comfort in the pardon of sin to the fifth 
knowledge of god to the first
in the third place he must before he pray 
consider what be his wants and imperfections which most trouble him 
as also the graces which he would obtain 
then for helping of his memory 
he must go to the petitions 
and he must set those things first in his minde 
which concern the first petition 
those which concern the second petition 
must have the second place in his mind 
and so he must proceed in order 
as he shall have occasion 
thus a man keeping in minde the order of the petitions as they stand 
shall be able by referring every grace and want to his proper head 
to make distinct prayer 
and to vary it as time 
place 
and other occasions shall move him 
but it is not necessary that we follow all the petitions in conceiving a prayer 
but onely those which do principally belong to the time 
place 
and occasion 
again a christian man may make an excellent confession of his sins by this prayercol 
19 
10 
11 if he shall 
keeping the order of the petitions 
confess and bewail the sins which every petition requires us to pray against 
and it serves to furnish us with matter of thankfulness 
thus 
let a man remember all the graces which he hath received from god 
let him then refer them to the petitions and give thanks to god after the order of them 
turning every petition into a thansgiving
q 
this form being so absolute 
what need we use any other words in praying
a 
because as to refuse this form savoureth of a proud contempt of christs ordinance 
so to confine our selves to these words alone 
argueth extream idleness in this duty 
wherein variety of words is required for the pouring out of our souls before the lordhos 
143 
and oftentimes 
according to the occasion 
some one petition is more then the rest 
to be insisted on and importunedmat 
2641 
wherefore our blessed saviour hath commended this form unto us 
as an excellent copy or lesson

imitated 
or at the least aimed at 
by us his scholars 
for which cause 
both he himself 
and his apostles

which yet may be referred to these
finally 
the liberty 
which the lord affordeth us 
is not to be abridged 
or despised 
who admitteth all languages 
words 
and forms 
agreeable to this pattern

rehearsed by heart
